{"source": "The sermon text for this morning is Acts 13, verses 1 through 4, and it's on page 921 in the blue Bible in front of you."}
{"source": "Acts 13, starting in verse 1, Now there were in the church at Antioch prophets and teachers, Barnabas, Simeon, who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manan, a lifelong friend of Herod the Tetrarch, and Saul."}
{"source": "John Patton, missionary from Scotland in the 19th century, was approached by a certain Mr. Dixon, who was critical of Patton's decision to take the gospel to cannibals dwelling in the New Hebrides Islands in the South Pacific."}
{"source": "John Patton was a missionary and he reached many for the gospel in that set of islands."}
{"source": "Today, we're not going to talk about John Patton."}
{"source": "We're going to talk about Paul and Barnabas from the book of Acts."}
{"source": "And Acts can be a tricky book."}
{"source": "Whereas with Acts, even a hundred verses, it's a little difficult to know how far to take things."}
{"source": "So, you see the trouble that we're running into because Acts, it's a story."}
{"source": "So, we could do a sermon on Acts 13 and 14 where I qualify everything that I say with maybe this or maybe that."}
{"source": "And then eventually recognize that Acts isn't looking to bear the whole weight of all of those convictions."}
{"source": "But I fear we would never actually hear Acts 13 and 14 on its own terms."}
{"source": "The third that I can think of is we can go on this missionary journey with Paul and Barnabas in the way that Luke, our human author for the book of Acts, seems to have intended that we do."}
{"source": "Acts 13, verse 1, page 921."}
{"source": "And they had John to assist them."}
{"source": "And John left them and returned to Jerusalem."}
{"source": "He references the ministry of John the Baptist as pointing to Jesus."}
{"source": "Look what Luke tells us in Luke in verse 52."}
{"source": "So I don't know where he first said it, but John Piper is pretty famous for saying that when it comes to missions and missionaries, there are, maybe you know this, goers, there are senders and there are disobedient."}
{"source": "So let me explain by going back to Deuteronomy 34, 9."}
{"source": "But in that verse, you'll see that Moses has put his hand on Joshua."}
{"source": "And by this act, he is putting part of his authority on Joshua so that the people of Israel will follow Joshua."}
{"source": "Numbers 8 verses 10 through 11."}
{"source": "Acts, now we're in our book, 6-6."}
{"source": "That was true for John Payton."}
{"source": "Listen to Isaiah 42, starting at verse 6."}
{"source": "The interview for the new job."}
{"source": "Well, today we finish up our sermon series on the book of 1 Thessalonians."}
{"source": "So if you're just joining us, 1 Thessalonians is a letter that was written by the Apostle Paul and it was written to a church in an ancient city called Thessalonica."}
{"source": "And so Paul wrote this letter, 1 Thessalonians, to reassure them."}
{"source": "These virtues are really the drumbeat of 1 Thessalonians."}
{"source": "Oh, is that your job?"}
{"source": "Yeah, it's my job."}
{"source": "He also uses the illustrations of an athlete and a soldier to describe the work of pastors in 2 Timothy chapter 2."}
{"source": "This week, Seth's job required him to go to the DMV."}
{"source": "Remember what Jesus said in Mark chapter 10."}
{"source": "And honestly, this is a difficult part of the job."}
{"source": "Notice that it's not simply the job of pastors to care for people."}
{"source": "It's the job of everyone to care for one another."}
{"source": "Paul calls these people busybodies in 2 Thessalonians 3."}
{"source": "In 1 John 4, verses 10 and 11."}
{"source": "Or Romans 5, 8."}
{"source": "James 1, 17."}
{"source": "Look what Paul says in Romans 5.1."}
{"source": "Malachi can be found on page 801, if you're using the Bible, under the chair in front of you."}
{"source": "Like all the other Old Testament prophets, Malachi makes this clear."}
{"source": "I would propose that the book of Malachi exists to prepare you for the day of judgment by putting a stake through the heart of that first way of relating to God."}
{"source": "Maybe you think of Genesis 15, and it's something like this."}
{"source": "And the fulfillment of this promise is envisioned at the end of the Bible, in the book of Revelation."}
{"source": "We covered this in the book of Exodus, you remember that?"}
{"source": "They could have judges, they could have kings."}
{"source": "So think about the books of Ezra, Nehemiah, the rebuilding of the city and the temple."}
{"source": "And the last of these prophets in your Bible is Malachi."}
{"source": "And what I want us to do this morning is to think about Malachi as our on-the-scene reporter."}
{"source": "Well, the scene here in Malachi is post-exilic Israel."}
{"source": "And Malachi, the prophet, is our reporter on the scene."}
{"source": "So in this book, the news anchors in the studio, they speak to Malachi on the scene and they say Malachi, alright."}
{"source": "Alright, Malachi, tell us, how's Israel's obedience going?"}
{"source": "And the feed cuts to Malachi, who's been there a little while now, and the scene is just, it's just dreary, it's raining, it's windy, it looks miserable, but strangely, Malachi has a smile on his face and he looks at the camera and with a big grin he nods and says it is terrible."}
{"source": "And the anchors in the studio, they kind of look at one another, they're perplexed, and they say, alright, well, thanks Malachi, I don't mean to get personal, but why exactly do you seem happy about this?"}
{"source": "And Malachi says, well, I've just come from speaking with the Lord himself, and what he says is that before he comes on that day of promised judgment, he's going to come a first time."}
{"source": "And the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple, this is Malachi's vision of what's happening in the future, and the messenger of the covenant in whom you delight, behold, he's coming, says the Lord of hosts."}
{"source": "Malachi says, he says these people's entire problem has been that they can't make themselves holy through obedience to God's commands."}
{"source": "Why am I smiling, Malachi says?"}
{"source": "Even Malachi, in a way, he kind of steps into the role of a spiritual meteorologist."}
{"source": "They themselves are getting a little giddy, and they say, Malachi, how will we know when this is happening?"}
{"source": "John the Baptist."}
{"source": "And on John's heels, we have Jesus, God incarnate, the light of the world, the son of righteousness, who sets out on a ministry of setting things right before the day of judgment."}
{"source": "This I think is the message that Malachi is pointing us to."}
{"source": "This is what I think is going on in Malachi."}
{"source": "The book of Malachi is one final prophetic critique of the insufficiency of the old covenant to produce holy people."}
{"source": "So what we see in the Old Testament as a whole, what we see here in Malachi in particular, is that the old covenant, the law, it's really good, but it's a really insufficient gift from God."}
{"source": "So before we kind of overview the rest of the book of Malachi, we should ask, does your hope of receiving favor, does your hope of receiving blessing from God in your mind, does that hope ultimately rest on your faithfulness to God or on God's faithfulness to you?"}
{"source": "I think this is what Malachi is pointing us to you."}
{"source": "Now the rest of the book of Malachi, the bulk of Malachi, it's just laying out a detailed report from God through Malachi to his people on the specific ways in which the old covenant has failed to produce the holy people that God desires."}
{"source": "This is Malachi's on-the-scene reporting, basically, for the rest of the time."}
{"source": "And specifically what Malachi reports is six disputes that the Lord has with his people."}
{"source": "So this is what Malachi is saying."}
{"source": "We'll give you six things that Malachi points out."}
{"source": "The oracle of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi, I have loved you, says the Lord."}
{"source": "The Lord through Malachi, he points to a second thing, and that is the old covenant failed to produce worship."}
{"source": "Listen to how Malachi puts it."}
{"source": "We covered this in 2 Corinthians 8 just a few weeks ago."}
{"source": "Two of them are lost to us, so what we call 2 Corinthians is actually the fourth letter that we know about that he wrote."}
{"source": "If you've been here through our series on 1 Corinthians and then 2 Corinthians now, you know that Paul's relationship with the church was a complicated one."}
{"source": "So back in Acts, chapter 18, we read that the Apostle Paul, having left his ministry in Athens, went to Corinth and spent time there, probably about 18 months, supporting himself by making tents while preaching about Jesus and ultimately pulling together a new church with the people that came to faith in him."}
{"source": "Based on details that we have in the book of Acts and then sort of external confirmation from archaeology, we can be really confident that Paul was in Corinth from 51 to 52 AD."}
{"source": "So Paul refers to that letter in 1 Corinthians chapter 5, verses 9 to 11."}
{"source": "We read about that in 1 Corinthians 1.11."}
{"source": "He mentions that letter in 1 Corinthians 7, verse 1."}
{"source": "So Paul writes back to them with the second letter that we know about, the letter we call 1 Corinthians."}
{"source": "And so Paul is addressing all of those things in 1 Corinthians."}
{"source": "And as we'll see in our passage for this morning from the end of 2 Corinthians, that visit was still a live issue with the church."}
{"source": "So in 2 Corinthians chapter 2 verse 1, he calls this trip, this second trip that he took to Corinth, a painful visit."}
{"source": "There's the second one that we call 1 Corinthians."}
{"source": "In 2 Corinthians 7, he calls it a tearful letter."}
{"source": "He sends this letter to Corinth by his good friend Titus."}
{"source": "And so Paul later meets up with Titus in Macedonia, and he hears how the church has responded to this third severe letter, rebuking them for the way they treated him and responded to him when he visited."}
{"source": "And what he found out from Titus was that most of the church had repented in response to his letter."}
{"source": "It's in that light that Paul writes his fourth letter to the church at Corinth, the letter that we call 2 Corinthians, the letter that we've been studying for some months now."}
{"source": "In 2 Corinthians chapter 12, starting in verse 11 and going down to verse 13, we read this."}
{"source": "So the book of Acts tells us a lot about Paul's visits to the different churches that he planted."}
{"source": "But when it tells us about his time in Corinth, it doesn't mention any sort of specific powerful acts or mighty wonders."}
{"source": "I urged Titus to go and sent the brother with him."}
{"source": "Did Titus take advantage of you?"}
{"source": "We've seen this before in the book of 2 Corinthians."}
{"source": "Remember he sent that severe letter, that third letter by Titus and by another brother that Paul doesn't name."}
{"source": "And so in verse 18, he says, look, did, did Titus rip you off when he came to you?"}
{"source": "It seems that no one was accusing Titus of anything unseemly."}
{"source": "Paul points out, look, I'm only doing, I've only done the same things Titus did, right?"}
{"source": "We know from 1 Corinthians that some of the church members were experiencing judgment for their behavior at the Lord's table."}
{"source": "We know from Acts chapter five that Ananias and Sapphira died because of their deceitful lying to the Holy Spirit."}
{"source": "Does that just mean excommunication, as he talks about in 1 Corinthians chapter five, that he would have to come and force the issue and expel his opponents from the church?"}
{"source": "We've seen so many times in 2 Corinthians that Paul is ultimately only concerned with the sight of God."}
{"source": "What a great summary of everything Paul's been pushing towards in 2 Corinthians."}
{"source": "Again, this is nothing new to 2 Corinthians."}
{"source": "And brothers and sisters, before we leave 2 Corinthians, we just need to remember that it's not just Jesus, it's not just Paul, but this is the pattern for our church."}
{"source": "I remember what Peter wrote to the church in 1 Peter 4, he says, rejoice in so far as you share Christ's sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed."}
{"source": "After all, in Matthew chapter 7, the Lord Jesus himself gives us a category for people that call him Lord, Lord, but find out that he actually doesn't know them."}
{"source": "Paul gives us a roadmap here in 2 Corinthians."}
{"source": "Well, this week we continue our two-week series in the book of Jude."}
{"source": "We saw last week that Jude was the half-brother of Jesus, and he was concerned about a threat to the gospel."}
{"source": "And so Jude wrote a short, urgent letter to the church, appealing to them to contend or to fight for the faith."}
{"source": "And I think Jude's message is going to be extremely relevant to many different types of people."}
{"source": "Imagine your Christian life is like a boxing match, and it's the end of the round, and you walk back to your corner, and in your corner is your trainer, and it's Jude, okay?"}
{"source": "Well, Jude is going to look you in the eye this morning, and he's going to encourage you."}
{"source": "Well, Jude is going to give you a proverbial slap in the face."}
{"source": "Well, Jude is going to spur you on today."}
{"source": "Well, Jude is going to try and persuade you to throw your hat in the ring, because this is a fight worth having, a battle worth entering, a prize worth winning."}
{"source": "So let's hear what Jude has to say to us this morning."}
{"source": "If you look at verse 17, you'll see that Jude says, but you must remember, beloved."}
{"source": "This is Jude's second call to remembrance in the letter."}
{"source": "This is what Jude is doing here."}
{"source": "If you recall last week, Jude has already cited two extra biblical works."}
{"source": "Our first impulse was to probably ask, why on earth would Jude refer to something that's not in the Bible?"}
{"source": "But I think we need to see that in Jude's day, the most audacious thing for him to do would be to quote the apostles alongside the Old Testament prophets."}
{"source": "And what Jude is doing here is really important because he's giving the apostles equal authority with the Old Testament prophets."}
{"source": "And Paul does this actually in Ephesians chapter 2, verse 20."}
{"source": "If you've read the book of Proverbs, that term might be familiar to you because the book of Proverbs has a lot to say about scoffers."}
{"source": "These are the kinds of people, Jude says, will come in the last time, ungodly people following their own sinful desires."}
{"source": "So Jude and his readers, they were living in the last time and so are we."}
{"source": "Maybe you're starting to notice that Jude likes to list things in sets of three."}
{"source": "That's because, Jude says, they're worldly people."}
{"source": "In fact, Jude says, they're devoid of the spirit."}
{"source": "They're ungodly because they're godless, Jude's trying to say."}
{"source": "How does Jude want us to fight?"}
{"source": "And then Jude gives us three participles that unpack how we do that."}
{"source": "Jude says, but you, beloved, don't be like those scoffers."}
{"source": "Paul's getting at this point in Colossians chapter two, verses six to seven."}
{"source": "Well, Jude isn't talking about some kind of special, advanced, protein-powered prayer here."}
{"source": "That's not what Jude is talking about."}
{"source": "Jude, he just simply wants us to pray."}
{"source": "Again, Paul seems to make this connection in Ephesians chapter 6."}
{"source": "That's what Jude is saying that we should do."}
{"source": "You know, Jude's just giving us Christianity 101 here, isn't he?"}
{"source": "Thankfully, in Romans 8, Paul tells us that the Holy Spirit actually helps us to pray."}
{"source": "So in Matthew 24, Jesus tells us that he is returning at an hour that we won't expect."}
{"source": "This is Jude's battle strategy."}
{"source": "But Jude gives us some simple ways to land a few jabs."}
{"source": "So Jude is not telling us to go away and fight for the faith as isolated individuals."}
{"source": "But Jude isn't done."}
{"source": "You know, in contending for the faith, Jude doesn't want us to become callous, because it's a sad reality, isn't it, that those who care most about protecting the faith can sometimes be kind of mean."}
{"source": "But Jude will have none of that."}
{"source": "Jude gives us, yep, you guessed it, three types of people."}
{"source": "It's likely that Jude is thinking here of people who've been destabilized by the false teachers."}
{"source": "And that's why Jude wants us to have mercy on those who doubt."}
{"source": "I think when we come across people like this, Jude's saying, don't condemn them."}
{"source": "In verse 23, Jude mentions those in danger."}
{"source": "However, Jude says these people can actually be saved."}
{"source": "And so Jude says, look, don't just write them off."}
{"source": "At the end of verse 23, Jude mentions a third group there, those who disobey."}
{"source": "Jude there seems to be thinking of those who've gone off the deep end."}
{"source": "Yet Jude tells us to show mercy to such people."}
{"source": "That's why Jude tells us to hate even the garment stained by the flesh."}
{"source": "So that's how Jude tells us to contend for the faith."}
{"source": "Well, thankfully, Jude doesn't end his letter in verse 23."}
{"source": "If the false teachers were perverting God's grace, Jude doesn't make the opposite mistake by extinguishing God's grace."}
{"source": "Jude ends his letter with a doxology."}
{"source": "Jude instructs us to keep ourselves in God's love."}
{"source": "That's why Jude bookends his letter with this truth."}
{"source": "Jude writes to those who are kept for Jesus Christ."}
{"source": "Do you see how carefully Jude threads the needle here?"}
{"source": "Psalm 63 verse 8 beautifully captures this dual reality of the Christian life."}
{"source": "And so Jude guards against two opposite errors here."}
{"source": "Jude doesn't want us to think that we can just coast along in the Christian life."}
{"source": "But Jude doesn't want the pendulum to swing too far because there's an opposite error that we can make."}
{"source": "But Jude has a better path."}
{"source": "But that's not what Jude is saying here."}
{"source": "Jesus makes that point in John 10, which Marty read earlier."}
{"source": "The prophet Malachi once imagined being in God's presence."}
{"source": "Well, Jude says, Christian, you will."}
{"source": "But Jude continues, he's not done."}
{"source": "Jude ends his hymn of praise by ascribing to God all glory, majesty, dominion, and authority."}
{"source": "Hasn't Jude galvanized you to keep going?"}
{"source": "It is 1 John, chapter 4, verses 7 to 21."}
{"source": "And so this morning in our passage from 1 John, we come to one of the most powerful, and maybe if you're not a Christian, if you're not used to reading the Bible, maybe one of the most startling statements in all the Bible."}
{"source": "As Christians, the God that we worship, the God that we delight in, the God that we believe has saved us, John says, is love."}
{"source": "So earlier in this letter, John told us that God is light."}
{"source": "Remember 1 John 1.5."}
{"source": "The author of Hebrews tells us that God is a consuming fire in Hebrews 12.29."}
{"source": "The apostle Paul tells us that God is one in Galatians 3.20, picking up on the foundational confession of the Israelite people."}
{"source": "In John chapter 4, Jesus reminds us that God is spirit."}
{"source": "And here in 1 John 4, in our passage for this morning, he is love."}
{"source": "Love is so foundational to God's character that it's not enough to say that he is loving or that he loves, but John tells us he is love."}
{"source": "So let's look carefully at what John says about God, about his love and about what it means for us."}
{"source": "And then second, let's see what John tells us about the love of God's people."}
{"source": "So as I mentioned, John wants to show us that we don't understand God if we don't understand his love."}
{"source": "So if you look at this passage in the Bible this morning, you'll see there in verse 7, John tells us love is from God."}
{"source": "So you don't have to be an expert in the Bible to get John's point, but notice what he shows us here about God's love, right?"}
{"source": "And we see that in his discussion of God's love, of the fact that God is love, John has to talk about all three persons of the Trinity, right?"}
{"source": "There in verse 13, John tells us, he says, by this, we know that we abide in him and he in us because he's given us his spirit, right?"}
{"source": "In verse 13, John tells us this God who is love abides in us."}
{"source": "John says there in verse 13, by the presence of his Holy Spirit."}
{"source": "In John's Gospel, Jesus repeatedly spoke of the love that his Father has for him and the love that he has for his Father."}
{"source": "So in the Old Testament, when God promises that he's never going to take his Spirit away from King David the way that he took his Spirit away from King Saul, he promises in 2 Samuel chapter 7, verse 15, that he says, I'll never take my love from you, right?"}
{"source": "Romans 5, 5 tells us God's love has been poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit."}
{"source": "I believe the God of the Bible, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the God who, according to John, is love, is the best explanation for why it is human beings love love so much."}
{"source": "The second thing John tells us here is that God's love is most clearly seen in the gift of the Lord Jesus Christ."}
{"source": "John writes, in this, the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only son into the world so that we might live through him."}
{"source": "Jesus tells us in Matthew's gospel that when the father makes his reign to fall on the just and the unjust, thus providing for their crops and their needs, he is showing love."}
{"source": "There in verse nine, John says, this is how God's love is manifest, how it's made apparent, how it's made visible to us."}
{"source": "John's at pains to show us there."}
{"source": "He sent his son in human flesh so that as John says there in verse nine, we might live through him."}
{"source": "We've seen that word propitiation before back in first John two, two, so I won't spend a lot of time on it, but that word indicates a sacrifice that takes away anger and replaces it with favor."}
{"source": "John tells us here and in chapter two is a propitiating sacrifice, taking away the anger of God towards us in our sins and replacing it with his favor."}
{"source": "I thought John said God is love."}
{"source": "He doesn't leave us in that state, but he, John tells us, sent his only son, the son that he loves, to be the propitiation for our sin."}
{"source": "As John says there in verse 10, he is our propitiating sacrifice."}
{"source": "So that again, in John's words, there at the end of verse nine, so that we might live through him."}
{"source": "John says that this is the place that we see God's love."}
{"source": "As John says there in verse 14, the father has sent his son to be the savior of the world."}
{"source": "And that's important because as we've already seen in John's letter, that sacrifice of Jesus is the model for how we are to love one another in the church family."}
{"source": "So you remember back in chapter three in verse 16, John said this, by this we know love that he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers."}
{"source": "This is what the author of Hebrews is arguing for much of the beginning of his letter."}
{"source": "This is Paul's reasoning in Romans eight, right?"}
{"source": "John would say verse nine, his only son, right?"}
{"source": "That's what God was telling the Israelites back in Deuteronomy 7."}
{"source": "This is what Paul is telling us in Romans chapter 5."}
{"source": "Let's move on and see what John tells us, having rooted us and sort of framed our understanding of love here with telling us about the love of God."}
{"source": "Let's move on and see what it is that John wants us to see about the love of God's people."}
{"source": "Because having told us that God is love, and that God's love is manifest in the gift of his Son, John wants that truth to produce in us, in our church, love for one another."}
{"source": "But what John's talking about specifically here in this passage is the love that you have for the other people in your church family."}
{"source": "In the original language that John was writing in, in Greek, you have the first two words there."}
{"source": "John tells us here in verse seven, love is from God."}
{"source": "It is, as John says there in verse seven, whoever, it's true that whoever has been born of God and knows God, loves his brothers and sisters."}
{"source": "See, there's a very important principle here that John is assuming that you understand."}
{"source": "John says we haven't seen God, but if we love one another, we are, we are putting on a display of his character and essence."}
{"source": "So much so that John can also say in this passage that the opposite is true."}
{"source": "The absence of love in your life for your brothers and sisters, John says, is evidence that you've not experienced the love of God."}
{"source": "If you say you know God and God is love and you don't love, John doesn't know what you're talking about, right?"}
{"source": "Do you remember that Jesus is teaching in Matthew 25, where he tells the story of the sheep and the goats?"}
{"source": "His love is so central to who he is and what it is that he's producing in his people that he can separate those who truly belong to him from those who just pay lip service to belonging to him based on their acts of love, right?"}
{"source": "As John says there in verse 20 of our passage, if anyone says, I love God and hates his brother, he's a liar for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he is not seen."}
{"source": "I think that makes sense of what John says there in verses 17 and 18."}
{"source": "So verse 16, John says that when we abide in love, we abide in God and he abides in us."}
{"source": "This isn't the first time John's talked to us about God's love reaching its completion."}
{"source": "If you remember back in first John two verse five, he said that the love of God is perfected in us when we keep his word and Lord willing, we'll think more about that when we get to chapter five here, John says that God's love reaches its intended goal."}
{"source": "That day that Jesus talks about back in Matthew 25, when we can face that day without fear, God's love shown in the gift of his son is intended to allow you to face the day of judgment without fear, right?"}
{"source": "And so if you're in Christ, John's saying you don't need to contemplate that day of judgment with any fear."}
{"source": "If I'm fearing that day because I'm aware of my own guilt and shame, but John reminds us that's all been washed away by God's love in Christ, right?"}
{"source": "So there at the end of verse 18, John says, if you fear, right?"}
{"source": "John says, let us love one another."}
{"source": "Well, if John's telling us anything here, that love is going to look like God's love, right?"}
{"source": "No one's seen God, John says here."}
{"source": "That's what Paul tells the church in Corinth, in 1 Corinthians 11, he says, let a person examine himself then and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup."}
{"source": "He's not saying, look, if you've done a great job this week, please come and experience my love, right?"}
{"source": "Our sermon passage this morning is Psalm 8, which you can find on page 450 of the Blue Bibles."}
{"source": "To the choir master, according to the Gitteth, a Psalm of David."}
{"source": "And this brings us to Psalm 8 this morning."}
{"source": "Psalm 8 is the very first Psalm of praise that we find in the Bible."}
{"source": "As the author of Hebrews puts it in chapter two, Psalm 8 points us to the world to come."}
{"source": "So what I wanna do this morning is I wanna look at Psalm 8 under two headings."}
{"source": "So this is a Psalm first and foremost about the majestic splendor of God."}
{"source": "So you'll notice there that the Psalm is bookended by the phrase, oh Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth."}
{"source": "David says something similar in Psalm 19 verse one."}
{"source": "In Romans chapter one, the apostle Paul takes hold of this reality and then he applies it to humanity's unbelief."}
{"source": "In verse two of Psalm eight, David highlights a surprising evidence of God's majesty."}
{"source": "The Greek translation of the Old Testament and even Hebrews chapter two interprets our passage this way."}
{"source": "David seems to be taking us back to Genesis chapter one."}
{"source": "It's worth noticing the structure of this psalm."}
{"source": "In a psalm that praises God's majestic splendor, we find man, human beings at the center."}
{"source": "We are smaller than specks, but God has literally taken us from the dust, Genesis 2.7, and he's crowned us with glory and honor."}
{"source": "Again, David's taken us back to Genesis 1, isn't he?"}
{"source": "However, Psalm eight does the opposite."}
{"source": "Psalm eight not only humbles us, it also exalts us."}
{"source": "Psalm eight is the cure for both extremes."}
{"source": "In fact, Psalm eight says he cares for you."}
{"source": "You know, sometimes it feels like God doesn't care for us, but the Bible's really clear that every good thing we receive in this life is from God, James 1, 17."}
{"source": "When God causes the sun to rise and the rain to fall, it's because he cares for us, Matthew 5, 45."}
{"source": "If you've ever eaten a meal or had a roof over your head or experienced gladness in your heart, it's because God has gifted you those things, Acts 14, 17."}
{"source": "Yet there's an obvious tension in this Psalm, isn't there?"}
{"source": "Psalm eight describes humanity as exalted with glory and honor, exercise and dominion over the earth."}
{"source": "So David takes us back to Genesis one in this Psalm."}
{"source": "However, Genesis three tells us that humanity, instead of receiving this crown of glory and honor from God, attempted to take God's crown of glory for themselves."}
{"source": "What exactly is Psalm 8?"}
{"source": "But in reality, Psalm 8 is a prophecy."}
{"source": "The fulfillment of Psalm 8 begins in the New Testament."}
{"source": "And listen to what Matthew records in Matthew 21."}
{"source": "He responds by citing Psalm 8, verse two."}
{"source": "In other words, he is saying that he is the Lord of Psalm 8."}
{"source": "By quoting Psalm 8, verse two, Jesus was subtly criticizing the religious leaders of his day."}
{"source": "Now, I love that story, not just because I sing that song to my kids nearly every night, but because it captures what we've been seeing in Psalm 8."}
{"source": "And even in that passage from Matthew."}
{"source": "Remember what Jesus prayed in Matthew 11, in verse 25 to 26."}
{"source": "But the problem of Psalm 8 still hangs over our heads."}
{"source": "The author of Hebrews picks up on this problem in chapter two of his letter, and he shows us that Jesus is the solution."}
{"source": "So in Hebrews 2, beginning in verse five, we read this."}
{"source": "He's basically saying that Jesus is the fulfillment of Psalm 8."}
{"source": "Well, the author of Hebrews says, so that by the grace of God, he might taste death for everyone."}
{"source": "And as Ephesians 2, 22 says, God has put all things under his feet."}
{"source": "Again, a fulfillment of Psalm 8."}
{"source": "In the world to come, as the author of Hebrews puts it, you will reign with Christ forever and ever, Revelation 22, verse five."}
{"source": "Well, I think Psalm 8 should both humble and exalt us this morning."}
{"source": "But Psalm 8 gives us perspective."}
{"source": "Yet Psalm 8 also exalts us."}
{"source": "Well, friends, Psalm 8 and the message of the Bible tells us something far better."}
{"source": "We see that in Psalm 8, and we see it in the cross of the Lord Jesus."}
{"source": "Would the good news of Psalm 8 both humble and exalt us this morning."}
{"source": "in the book of 1st John, chapter 5, 13 through 15."}
{"source": "If you're not familiar with the Bible, the large numbers are the chapter markers, the smaller numbers are the verse markers."}
{"source": "So follow along with me as I read 1st John 5, starting at verse 13."}
{"source": "It wasn't until one day when he was reading the New Testament letter of St. Paul to the Romans that he finally understood the message of the Bible and how it is that we can have eternal life, and how it is that we can know that we have eternal life."}
{"source": "Well, in our passage for this morning from John's first letter, we see that followers of Christ can know that they have eternal life."}
{"source": "And so let's turn to first John chapter five together."}
{"source": "So first, the believer's certainty, you see there in verse 13, John speaks to the issue."}
{"source": "So John is telling us here why he is writing these things."}
{"source": "Now, if you're familiar with the gospel account that John wrote of Jesus's life, if you remember towards the end of that gospel, he also told his readers why it was that he was writing."}
{"source": "So he says in John chapter 20, starting in verse 30, he says this, he says, Now, Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book."}
{"source": "So John tells us that he wrote his gospel for the person who hadn't yet heard about Jesus, so that they might believe that he is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing that person might have life in his name."}
{"source": "And so John's purpose in this letter was to give them confidence."}
{"source": "There in verse 13, John says that they believe in the name of the Son of God."}
{"source": "There's no doubt in John's mind that his readers believe in Jesus, that they trust that he is the Christ, the Son of God."}
{"source": "This is what Jesus talks about in John chapter 11."}
{"source": "We read there in John 11, starting in verse 25."}
{"source": "We've thought about that earlier in first John."}
{"source": "It's that life that John wants his readers to know that they have."}
{"source": "Again, you can understand why this is such an important issue to the church to which John is writing."}
{"source": "And so John wants to reassure these faithful Christians."}
{"source": "Well, in many ways, that's what the whole letter of first John has been about, right?"}
{"source": "Throughout this book, we've seen that John is giving us evidence, ways that we can tell that we really, truly have this eternal life in us, but he's giving us three lines of evidence, three things we can look for in our lives so that we can have confidence that we know God, right?"}
{"source": "So John says you have eternal life."}
{"source": "So again, in chapter two, starting in verse 28, John writes this, he says, now little children abide in him so that when he appears, we may have confidence and not shrink from him in shame at his coming."}
{"source": "John has confidence that the members of the church that he's writing to will pass these three tests."}
{"source": "But now John seems to be saying the very same thing, right?"}
{"source": "But don't misunderstand what John's saying here."}
{"source": "He is not saying that if you do a good enough job, God will reward you with eternal life."}
{"source": "And if you don't do a good enough job, you are on the outside looking in."}
{"source": "No, remember in John's gospel, we are told that this eternal life that John wants us to know that we have, it is a gift of God."}
{"source": "Remember John chapter 3 verse 16, for God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life."}
{"source": "The Apostle Paul reminds us in Romans chapter 6 verse 23, for the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."}
{"source": "And so when John gives us these three tests, doctrine, obedience, love, he is not giving you three things you can do to improve your odds of making it through Judgment Day well."}
{"source": "When you continue on believing in the Son of God, despite living in a world that finds that idea silly or unsophisticated or even bigoted, when you continue hating your sin and fighting against it, when you continue loving others in the church and serving them in practical ways, John is saying you can know only the Spirit of God produces that kind of fruit."}
{"source": "But that's not what John's talking about here."}
{"source": "John has an application to all of this there in verses 14 and 15."}
{"source": "So John, having told us in verse 13 that we know that we have eternal life, then turns in verse 14 to give us an immediate application of that principle."}
{"source": "But I think maybe John's meaning is a bit obscured."}
{"source": "Verses 14 and 15 make clear that this confidence that John envisions plays out for us in the way that we pray."}
{"source": "No, this hearing that John talks about, when he talks in verse 14 about he will hear us, it has the sense of giving heed to, a sense of being heard, understood, welcomed, paid attention to."}
{"source": "That's what John's saying here in verse 14."}
{"source": "There in verse 15, John draws it out a bit further for us."}
{"source": "And the application that John makes is to the way that we pray."}
{"source": "Now to me, again, one massive question arises from what John says here."}
{"source": "John seems to make it, you know, clear that we already have the thing we asked for, right, at the end of verse 15."}
{"source": "Lord, please give me that job."}
{"source": "But you don't get the job."}
{"source": "And so it can be tempting for us to think that what John says here actually isn't true, that we're not heard, that we don't have that for which we've asked the Father."}
{"source": "But I think we need to wrestle with what John says here in verse 14."}
{"source": "I might ask for a job."}
{"source": "And so John clarifies the promise for us."}
{"source": "And so, of course, the Lord Jesus taught us to pray in just this way in Matthew chapter 6 verse 9."}
{"source": "So we read in Matthew chapter 26 verse 39, speaking of Jesus, and going a little farther, he fell on his face and prayed, saying, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me."}
{"source": "A few verses later, Matthew 26 42."}
{"source": "A couple of verses later, Matthew tells us simply he prayed the same way a third time."}
{"source": "If you pray for a spouse or a job, a direction in life, healing for a disease, growth in holiness, you can be sure of your your Heavenly Father's goodwill."}
{"source": "So when you pray any prayer, when you ask according to his will, as John says there in verse 14, he hears us and he always answers."}
{"source": "In fact, John says there at the end of verse 15 that we know we have the requests that we've asked of him."}
{"source": "Right, it is such a certainty that while that our experience of God's answer to our prayer might be delayed, John speaks of it there as if we know it's already happened."}
{"source": "It is 1st John 5 20 to 21."}
{"source": "Joseph Smith's revelation?"}
{"source": "Muhammad's very different revelation?"}
{"source": "In fact, this was the issue facing the first century church to which the New Testament letter of 1st John was written."}
{"source": "John's writing a letter to people who knew exactly what was going on and so he doesn't sort of restate for us all of the issues in play."}
{"source": "Well, in many ways John's been writing in this letter, to which we come to the end today, in order to address that crisis of authority."}
{"source": "And so as we think about the very end of John's letter, 1st John 5 verses 20 to 21, I'd like to look at two things together."}
{"source": "First, let's look and see what John tells us about what Jesus came to do."}
{"source": "And second, let's look and see what John tells us about how we ought to live in light of that fact."}
{"source": "I want to see two things that John tells us about what he came to do."}
{"source": "So John writes there, We know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding."}
{"source": "John says there, The Son of God has come."}
{"source": "That's what John's talking about here in 1 John 5.20."}
{"source": "He wasn't a man with sort of divine revelation, but he came the fully divine Son of God in human flesh and thus was fully human as well."}
{"source": "The second thing John's affirming for us here in verse 20 is that Jesus came for a purpose."}
{"source": "He came, John says, to give us understanding."}
{"source": "But here, John looks at one aspect of the salvation that Jesus came to bring."}
{"source": "Well, according to John here, one way we can answer that question is to say that he came to give us understanding."}
{"source": "Jesus came to give us understanding, John says, there in verse 20, so that we may know him who is true."}
{"source": "So Jesus came to give us understanding, to give us knowledge of, John says, him who was true."}
{"source": "John doesn't make it explicit here, but I think it's clear that when he says him who is true, he's talking about God the Father."}
{"source": "So we see this in the gospel account that John wrote of Jesus's life."}
{"source": "In John chapter 17, Jesus prays to God the Father in this way."}
{"source": "So he's speaking to his heavenly Father in John 17 verse 3."}
{"source": "So in John's thinking, the only true God is a way of referring to God the Father."}
{"source": "So in John chapter 14, we read about a conversation that Jesus had with his disciples, and I think it sheds light on what John's saying here."}
{"source": "In John chapter 14, starting in verse 6, Jesus said to him, I, he's speaking to Thomas here, I am the way and the truth and the life."}
{"source": "And there are some things that you can know about God through his revelation of himself in the Old Testament."}
{"source": "But what Jesus is saying in John's Gospel, and what John's saying here in this letter, is that there are some things about God, the Father, that you would not know if Jesus didn't reveal them to us, if the Son of God didn't show us."}
{"source": "So there in John chapter 14, Jesus tells Thomas, he says, from now on, you will know God, the Father."}
{"source": "What was about to happen that would sort of mark a decisive point in Thomas's understanding of God?"}
{"source": "So in his letter, John reminds his readers that Jesus came so that we might understand."}
{"source": "This means that anything that you see of Jesus in your Bible, so as you're reading and you're confronted by Jesus's kindness and his mercy and his love and his grace and his compassion for sinners, when you see the way that he cares for and protects those who are weak, when you see his righteousness and purity and his hatred for injustice and wickedness, you can be sure that whatever you see of Jesus is a revelation of God the Father."}
{"source": "Jesus came, John says, to give us understanding so that we might know him who is true."}
{"source": "And this also means that we shouldn't look to understand God apart from his revelation through his Son."}
{"source": "There is a second thing here that John tells us, a second thing that Jesus came to do."}
{"source": "John says we are actually in him who is true."}
{"source": "Before we were born of God, right, like the rest of the world, John tells us in 1 John 5, 19, the verse immediately preceding this one, he says that we were, like the rest of the world, in the grasp of the evil one."}
{"source": "When we come to what we read at the end of John's gospel account, we peer into some of the deepest and most wonderful truths of the Bible, right?"}
{"source": "So back to John chapter 14, Jesus is speaking here to Philip, just a few verses after the ones I read earlier."}
{"source": "The second one, in order to understand what John's saying here in 1 John 5, 20 is this, when the Holy Spirit indwells us, right?"}
{"source": "When the Holy Spirit causes us as human beings to be born of God, as John puts it in chapter five, verse 18, the Spirit unites us spiritually to the Lord Jesus."}
{"source": "Jesus gives a really helpful word picture in John chapter 15 to help us kind of put flesh on this idea."}
{"source": "So if you put those two truths together, I think you get some sense of what John's talking about here in verse 20 of our passage, when he says, we are in him who is true, in his son, Jesus Christ."}
{"source": "We are, in John's words, in him who is true."}
{"source": "If you find it hard to wrap your mind around all that John is saying here, or maybe the inartful way that I've tried to express it, that's actually a good thing."}
{"source": "But here in 1 John 5, we're reminded that the arrival of God's son was not merely some cute, cuddly, sentimental hallmark moment."}
{"source": "As John says there at the end of verse 20, he is the true God and eternal life, right?"}
{"source": "Like, why doesn't my life, if everything John says here is true, why doesn't my life feel like one unending, glorious, spiritual high?"}
{"source": "What John says is still true."}
{"source": "John concludes his letter with these words, little children."}
{"source": "It's most likely that John's writing from Ephesus, a city crawling with sites for worshiping idols."}
{"source": "But here John is exhorting believers, you have been given this marvelous gift."}
{"source": "If we want to live in the joy of our salvation, if we want to have a daily experience of enjoying our union with him who is true, John says keep yourselves from idols."}
{"source": "The Apostle Paul helps us, I think, to see how this works in Colossians chapter 3 verse 5."}
{"source": "Or it could be, and I think this is the case for John's readers and the case for us, it's because we aren't really confident that the true God is going to give us everything we need."}
{"source": "And so we have to heed vigilantly John's call here."}
{"source": "But John says here, keep yourselves from idols."}
{"source": "You spend your whole life trying to get a certain job, a certain promotion, and then you get it and you realize, well, I'm still the same person with the same problems."}
{"source": "Look to the one who is, in John's words, eternal life."}
{"source": "And so look at what we see of the Father when we look at the revelation of Jesus."}
{"source": "The best husband, the best wife, the best kids, the best job, the best car, the best sports team."}
{"source": "Our sermon passage this morning is from 1st John chapter 3 verses 11 through 24, which you can find on page 1022 of the church Bibles For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning that we should love one another we should not be like Cain who Sorry, we should not be like Cain who was of the evil one and murdered his brother and Why did he murder him because his own deeds were evil and his brothers righteous Do not be surprised brothers that the world hates you."}
{"source": "Those things might make you feel better But I can't help feeling that it's a bit like giving a painkiller to someone with a gaping laceration Those things might mask some of the symptoms of guilt and condemnation, but they don't really seem to address the larger issue They don't address the the cause of our guilt and shame So if you're feeling that way today If you are in any way ashamed of yourself ashamed of things that you've done feeling condemned for who you are And for all that you're not Well, the Apostle John wants to talk to you He's actually got good news for you Let's start out at the end of the passage that Shelby Joe just read for us They're in verses 19 to 20 of 1st John chapter 3."}
{"source": "Listen to what John says here 1st John chapter 3 verse 19 by this we shall know that we are of the truth and Reassure our heart before him for whenever our heart condemns us God is greater than our heart and he knows everything You see the issue John is addressing how do we know that we are in his words of the truth How can I have confidence that I'm one of God's children in light of all my sin in light of all the ways?"}
{"source": "Reassurance when my heart condemns me Notice John doesn't say if your heart condemns you or if our hearts condemn us."}
{"source": "I'm I guess I'm completely off the map No, John anticipates that this is gonna happen."}
{"source": "It might not be good But it's not unexpected And thank God John has a solution in that circumstance So again, if you're here today and you feel guilty you feel condemned John has good news for us."}
{"source": "It turns out it's news about God himself God John says is greater than your heart God is greater than your heart if you struggle with a guilty conscience write that on your mirror Put it on the lock screen of your phone Record yourself saying it and make it your ringtone If you walk around all day feeling guilty and condemned It's because you're looking at you and not at God John says God is Greater than your heart notice."}
{"source": "You're fantastic No, no, John doesn't see the solution to your guilt and your shame really beginning in you at all He wants to talk about God and he says God is greater than your heart The picture here is something like a courtroom There's you You're the defendant Guilty of all kinds of weakness fault failure sin And then there's your heart the prosecuting attorney Maybe this is something like your conscience, right, but it levels charges against you."}
{"source": "It condemns you And then John introduces the third party in this little courtroom drama God the judge And he says it's God's verdict And he says it's God's verdict that matters Right the prosecutor always thinks the the the party on trial should be condemned, right?"}
{"source": "It's the judge's opinion that matters And so John says look God is the judge He's greater than your heart It's it's his word that matters about you not your heart's word what God says goes The second piece of information there in verse 20 is that God knows everything so God's greater than your heart and God knows Everything now on the face of it."}
{"source": "That sounds terrifying Right, you're thinking that's why I feel so guilty because I know that God knows everything But John seems to think that that information should again verse 19 reassure our hearts before him John seems to think that God's authority The fact that it's his word as judge that stands And God's omniscience the fact that he knows everything."}
{"source": "John seems to think that that fact will will calm our clamoring hearts And so what does that tell us?"}
{"source": "Some of us really need to hear it Right a lot of us would live with more joy more freedom and more boldness if we actually believe what John says right here What John says right here God does not want his children walking around all day feeling guilty and condemned He does not want you to sit back and let your heart beat the tar out of you What he wants for you is there in verse 19 He wants you to know that you are of the truth That you are his child And he wants your heart to be reassured before him So if your heart's telling you that the really Honorable thing to do is to feel badly about your sin If your heart's telling you look it is presumptuous to go to God with all this talk of boldness and confidence That your sin means that God is your judge is really mad at you That he's at least disappointed in you That he's barely tolerating you Well, then tell your heart the truth God knows everything And he's greater than your heart Your heart doesn't get to win this conversation."}
{"source": "He's greater than your heart and he knows everything He's greater than your heart and he knows everything The goal is for you to know that you are his child that you are of the truth look there in verses 21 to 22 John says beloved If our heart does not condemn us We have confidence before God And whatever we ask we receive from him because we keep his commandments And do what pleases him You see if you can learn to tell your heart the truth That God is greater and that he knows everything if you can believe that so that your heart doesn't condemn you John says then you have confidence before God And again, not a confidence rooted in my goodness Right not a confidence born out of the notion of self-forgiveness But a confidence rooted in God's eternal unchanging Greater than my heart goodness It's a confidence rooted in the fact that God is so merciful so loving so kind that he sent his son To die on the cross for our sins and to rise from the dead in victory Over sin and death and everything that should make you feel guilty and condemned He's faithful and just to forgive your sin as we read earlier in john's letter."}
{"source": "John says whatever we ask we receive from him That is to say you that is to say you can be sure that when you come to God in prayer Asking for what you need you will receive it But now to be clear john isn't saying that god's obligated to give you everything you ask for Right."}
{"source": "Jesus christ And so with that truth in mind we pray with boldness we pray for the things that we need Personally and as a church family we pray boldly for the salvation of our family and friends For the spread of the gospel through all nations for the help that we need to change and grow In all the ways that are necessary God's greatness His knowledge his love means that our hearts can be assured before him and we can have great confidence When we go to him in prayer Look at the last thing john says there in verse 22 He says we have confidence before god and we receive what we ask for Because we keep his commandments And do what pleases him Now again that sounds like it might be a bit mercenary like god's basically buying our obedience with treats But I think this is the key to connecting what john says here to the rest of the book And particularly with the rest of our passage that we're going to think about this morning What john has been driving at in this letter is assurance He wants clarity He wants confidence Right and he's been weaving together Three strands of evidence That give us confidence that we belong to god that we are his children John's been trying to sort of weave together together Three sort of sets of data that if you see these things present in your life, you can have real confidence that you are god's child There's first the test of a proper confession of faith Right confessing that jesus is lord the son of god come in the flesh We saw that in chapter 2 lord willing we're going to see it again in chapter 4 Right."}
{"source": "We're going to see it again in chapter 5 And then there's also the third test the test of love We've seen that in chapter 2 We saw it last week at the very end of verse 10 And we'll plan to see it again in chapter 4 and that's what john wants to talk about with us today Right, we see all three of those things reflected there in verses 23 to 24 of chapter 3 So he says this is his commandment That we believe in the name of his son jesus christ and love one another just as he's commanded us Whoever keeps his commandments abides in god and god in him and by this we know that he abides in us by the spirit Whom he has given us So john says this is how we know that he abides that he abides in us that he lives in us by his spirit that That's been given to us."}
{"source": "He says the spirit of god leads you to believe in the name of the son jesus So that's that's the first test the doctrinal test the confessional test He says the spirit of god leads you to keep his commandments That's the obedience test And he says the spirit of god causes christians to love one another that's the test of love If you have those three three things present in your life You can have confidence that you belong to god your heart can be assured in his presence And so with the rest of the time that we have in our passage for this morning We want to dig into what john says about love We want to hear what john says in terms of christians loving their brothers and sisters But again, you have to be careful with with john not to mishear him He is not Telling us to love one another as he's going to in this passage."}
{"source": "He's not doing that to condemn you He's not doing that to say look you're not loving enough get with the program Now john understands that if you're a christian god has put his love in you He's put love For your brothers and sisters in your heart."}
{"source": "And so what john wants to do is not condemn you But he wants to point it out to you He wants to show you how to recognize it in your life He wants you to cultivate it and inflame it so that you can have confidence and assurance in god's presence So that you could have joy And so that you can pray boldly And so that end let's look at two things that we see in this passage First let's see the necessity Of christian love."}
{"source": "John gives us why is it that john says the presence of of christian love in your life is strong Evidence that you are god's child and then second."}
{"source": "So first the necessity of christian love Why does john say that love for other christians?"}
{"source": "Look there in verse 11 He says for this is the message that you have heard from the beginning That we should love one another And this is just like what we read back in first john chapter 2 verse 7 In fact, we're just about at the middle point of john's letter And what we're going to see and what we've been seeing Is that as we go along reading first john is like climbing a spiral staircase Right."}
{"source": "We keep coming back to the same place just at a slightly higher elevation And so john wants to revisit an idea that he's already introduced back in chapter 2 He wants to take a deeper dive on the connection between the gospel message that the apostles proclaimed And the love that christians have for one another for their brothers and sisters in the faith The apostle summarizes the point there in chapter 3 verse 16."}
{"source": "He says by this we know love That he laid down his life for us And we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers John says here's the heart of love Here is the event by which love is known the standard by which all love must be measured and understood jesus he Laid down his life for us Right."}
{"source": "He saw our need And he endured all of that that humiliation that suffering He endured all of that for our sake So john points to that great act of love and says there it is You want to know love there it is that's the thing that's love So put that in the context of what we saw last week in first john chapter 3 verses 4 to 10 All right."}
{"source": "Remember last week we saw that children resemble their parents All right, you can tell Whose child someone is by the way, they live and the way that they love we saw last week god's children love what god loves The devil's children love what he loves and so here john tells us That what or john tells us what it is or more accurately who it is that god loves God it turns out loves his people He loves the one for whom jesus laid down his life Right in the words of verse 16."}
{"source": "He seeks to to harm and to deceive them at every point That's what john shows us here, right god's children love god's people They love one another because their father loves one another the devil's children hate god's people And so the apostle launches in our passage into a discussion of love and hatred there in verses 12 to 15 So we read there starting in verse 12 We Should not be like cain Who was of the evil one?"}
{"source": "Because his own deeds were evil And his brothers righteous Do not be surprised brother that the world hates you We know that we've passed out of death into life because we love the brothers Whoever does not love abides in death Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him So john starts talking about hatred And he points us to the example of cain Back in genesis chapter 4."}
{"source": "So if you know that story cain and his brother abel were sons of adam and eve cain murdered abel in a fit of rage John tells us that cain was of the evil one Right."}
{"source": "John's been trying to help us discern What marks off those who belong to god versus those who belong to the devil?"}
{"source": "And so here john is telling us that cain is an example of what we saw back in verse 10 last week someone who is evidently a child of the evil one He says you want to know what it looks like."}
{"source": "cain hated his brother John asks there in the middle of verse 12."}
{"source": "No, john tells us there in verse 12 that it was abel's righteousness That's what cain hated so much Cain's deeds were evil abel's were righteous And so cain hated him and murdered him John draws two lessons for us from that fact."}
{"source": "John is connecting the dots for us if the world lies in the power of the evil one as he says in chapter 5 verse 19 And if cain is a representative of the devil's approach to people who practice righteousness Then we can expect that the world is going to hate anyone who loves the lord Who follows jesus?"}
{"source": "And it seems that john wants us to know that So that we won't be surprised Notice he doesn't really expect that we're going to be able to fix it He just wants you to know it's going to happen."}
{"source": "He doesn't want you to be taken off guard to be shocked He doesn't want you to panic When the world hates you he doesn't want you to think that things have gone terribly wrong When you're opposed by the world Right when we read about christians being persecuted and killed in north korea and nigeria and india and iran Well, we understand why When we see our own culture becoming increasingly hostile to christians and christian belief We understand why If your co-workers or your family have rejected you because you follow jesus Well, don't be surprised Take comfort from the fact that god has told you in advance that this is what's going to happen The second thing john has for us here Is to show us that hate is incompatible With being a follower of christ Right."}
{"source": "We read this He says whoever does not abide who i'm, sorry, whoever does not love abides in death Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him And john's echoing here what jesus taught back in matthew chapter 5 that hating someone in your heart Is the same kind of sin as murder?"}
{"source": "Murder is simply a a very evil version an extreme version of hatred But they're they're really both cut from the same cloth And we know that murder is a sin worthy of condemnation John says no murderer has eternal life abiding in them Right."}
{"source": "John."}
{"source": "John isn't saying here that murderers can't be forgiven that they can't be Restored to god if they've repent of their sins and trust in christ But he's saying that on their own on the face of it a murderer someone who murders people Isn't someone who has god's eternal life abiding in them?"}
{"source": "And so john's saying if hatred and murder are related And murder makes it obvious that you don't have god's life abiding in you that you're not his child Then he says look god's children can't be characterized by hate either It's incompatible with with christian belief with really being a child of god So john talks here about the hatred that the world has he doesn't want you to be surprised and he wants you to see How incompatible it is with being a christian Now look there that's what john says about hatred."}
{"source": "Into the the realm and the family of god who loves his people Well, john says it's the presence of love in our lives That's one of the things that uniquely characterizes god's children and notice it's not love in the abstract It's not love for the arts It's not romantic love."}
{"source": "John says here And that's our first point Christian love is necessary That leads us naturally."}
{"source": "Well, john tells us there in verse 16, this is how we know love he Jesus laid down his life for us We see love most perfectly at the cross of christ as he willingly gave up his life again as john says there for us In our place as our substitute Right."}
{"source": "It looks like jesus an innocent man giving up his life And extraordinarily enough this amazing Cosmic eternity altering love that's being held up for us there in verse 16 right Not just as an object of awe and worship it turns out but john holds it up as a model He says this love It's an example to you Jesus says there's no greater love than that."}
{"source": "Someone would lay down their life for their friends and john says yeah, exactly Christian that's what your love ought to look like just as he laid down his life for us So too we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters Again, this is what we've been seeing the past few weeks being god's child as as john's told us at the beginning of this chapter Chapter three verse one."}
{"source": "It means reflecting his image And here john tells us that means loving other christians Right the way that he does."}
{"source": "That's what we thought about last week What we didn't talk about last week is how john finishes that sentence nor is the one who does not love his brother Being god's child means reflecting his image and that means loving other christians the way he's loved us And so john reminds us here that that way Is the way of sacrifice?"}
{"source": "God's love saw us in a terrible state Lost in our sins condemned without hope and his love moved him to meet that need The father's love caused him to send the son John chapter 3 verse 16 for god so loved the world That he gave his only son That whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life God's love moved him to meet your need The love of the son led him to lay down his life for us again John chapter 15 verse 13 that we read earlier greater love has no one than this that someone laid down his life for his friends All right, and in love the spirit of god plants that same Sacrificial need meeting life laying down love in us The spirit plants it like a seed we saw last week in verse 9 of our passage Right god the spirit causes this love that god has shown us to abide in us John says in in verse 17 and verse 24 of our passage God the father loves god the son loves by by meeting our need and god the spirit places that same love in us And so how do you know that you're one of god's children Well, you'll love your brothers and sisters How do you know that you're loving your brothers and sisters?"}
{"source": "John says there verse 13."}
{"source": "John's talking about a material need right because he says if you have the world's goods Right, you have the ability to resolve this problem."}
{"source": "You have stuff You have money and you see your brother or sister in need John says if you close your heart against them if you refuse to help them when you're able to help When instead of sacrificing for them You prefer your own interests Then john asks rhetorically how can god's love possibly live in you if god's love is a Need meeting love if god's love is seen in his Willingness to meet the needs of his people if you see one of his people in need and have no interest in meeting that need Then then what do you mean by saying you're god's child?"}
{"source": "John says I don't know what you mean by calling yourself a christian Christian Again this is not a new development In verse 11 john says this is the message you've heard from the beginning Right."}
{"source": "It's very likely that that john has in his mind Even the instructions that were given to israel back in the old testament many centuries earlier in deuteronomy chapter 15 starting in verse 7 The lord spoke to the people of israel and told them how they were to love one another as his children He says there in deuteronomy if any if among you um One of your brothers should become poor in any of the towns within your land that the lord your god is giving you You shall not harden your heart echoes of what john's talking about in our passage Or shut your hand against your poor brother, but you shall open your hand to him and lend him sufficient for his need whatever it may be Take care lest there be an unworthy thought in your heart And you say the seventh year the year of release is near And your eye looked grudgingly on your poor brother And you give him nothing and he cried to the lord against you and you be guilty of sin You shall give to him freely and your heart shall not be grudging when you give to him Because for this the lord your god will bless you in all your work and in all that you undertake You see the law of god was meant to help the people of israel reflect the character of their god He is a generous giver."}
{"source": "John summarizes there in verse 18 He says little children Let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth As we've seen throughout this letter the apostle addresses the church with tender affection He's an elderly man by this point in his life."}
{"source": "He says it's easier To be enthusiastic about humanity with a capital h Than it is to love individual men and women Especially those who are uninteresting Exasperating depraved or otherwise unattractive Loving everybody in general may be an excuse for loving nobody in particular And so john tells us here."}
{"source": "It should not be so with you Don't just talk about your love your general benevolence towards humanity with a capital h but he says love truly love in your deeds And so what does that look like for us as a church Well, sometimes it looks just like what john is talking about here You've got resources You've got money Someone has a need and you meet that need Sometimes it looks like sacrificing your time Someone is lonely Someone's hurting Someone needs help to grow in christ."}
{"source": "Someone needs someone who will pray with them Honestly, I think that might be more difficult For many of us to to love that way So john was writing in a time where people had a lot of time and not a lot of money Loudoun county, we have a lot of money and not a lot of time I think I think a lot of us would probably rather stroke a check Than actually invest our lives in someone actually have to give up our free time our comfort our ease But here john shows us real love is costly Real love is sacrificial Real love means meeting a need whenever you're able So in our context, maybe real love Means like coming to things like the fellowship meal Or a sunday night gathering or a men's retreat or a women's retreat, even if that's not your thing Even if that's not your favorite way to spend time because it'll actually provide you with an opportunity to love other people Maybe you could talk to someone who doesn't seem well connected in the church family."}
{"source": "John's goal isn't to make you feel like you're not doing enough to love other people Right."}
{"source": "No, no doubt We all look at this passage and we need to be corrected Right, if you can look at the standard that john sets for us there in verse 16 The sacrificial love of christ on the cross if you can look at that standard and then look at your life And conclude that you're doing an amazing job Right."}
{"source": "We need to allow this passage to set the culture for our church We need to make this the sort of default expectation for how every member treats every other member But the the goal here john says is that our hearts would be assured in god's presence John's goal is actually that you would have a deep confidence that you are his child And brothers and sisters that's I think what I see as I look at our church Just this week as i've been reading through this passage and praying For the church i've been reminded of a million ways That I see the love of christ sort of made manifest in our midst I've thought this week so many times about the different ways i've experienced love Sacrificial love from so many of you I've thought about the many times I hear Examples of members in the church quietly without fanfare loving one another sacrificially sometimes people will make a comment and i'll be like wait what that person did that for them and you realize like oh there is An amazing love being displayed without without any sort of public fanfare And that gives us confidence That's how we know that we are of the truth If we look at our church family, and if you look at your life and you see no love well, then There should be no confidence But john doesn't actually expect that christians will have that experience."}
{"source": "Certainly But genuine evidence in your life Of god's love flowing out of you towards your brothers and sisters and he expects that that's going to actually encourage you Give you confidence as you pray and give you joy as you love one another So the best thing for us to do is not simply to resolve to love more and love better Now the logic of this passage tells us that what we need to do first is to be loved To be to marinate ourselves In that verse 16 love the love that jesus showed to us on the cross Because john expects that when that love shapes our life When that love is what controls our emotions and determines our decisions Then john says we will love sacrificially We will love indeed and in truth just as we've been loved Just as we've been loved What we need to do In order to love more Is to be loved by the lord jesus And there may be no better way to grow in love Than to come to the lord's table Because it's here that we remember that we celebrate that we meditate on the love that the lord jesus showed to us By giving up his body for us shedding his blood for us on the cross And so let's come to the table now Let's come to celebrate and to rejoice in god's great love for us and let's come loving one another But first let's pray Oh gracious heavenly father we we delight in your love That when you are forming us into your image, you are forming us into something."}
{"source": "Amen Romans 8 1 through 11."}
{"source": "Romans chapter 8, not a traditional Easter text perhaps, but I think as Heidi was reading it perhaps you saw the way that the Apostle's thinking here touches on some Easter themes."}
{"source": "You can see why in Romans chapter 3 Paul says that none of us is righteous."}
{"source": "Paul tells us in Romans that it's a master that rules over us."}
{"source": "In his letter to the Romans, Paul captures this idea with the figurative phrase, the flesh."}
{"source": "And so in our passage for this morning from Romans chapter 8, we see Paul reflecting on what it means for us as human beings to be in the flesh."}
{"source": "That power acts on it."}
{"source": "Gravity is a law that acts on everything within its power."}
{"source": "A few verses later in Romans eight, verse 14, Paul says this."}
{"source": "You can read Romans chapter seven."}
{"source": "But what Paul's saying here in Romans eight is that you are not under its rule."}
{"source": "I think the apostle Paul gives us a deep dive on this in Galatians 5, a picture of what it means a picture of what it means to live under the law of the spirit of life."}
{"source": "In Galatians 5, in verses 16 and 17, we read this."}
{"source": "Can you see how he's talking about the same things that he's discussing in Romans 8?"}
{"source": "But what Paul's telling us here in Romans 8 is that this battle that's waged within us, the outcome is not in doubt."}
{"source": "Paul goes on in Galatians 5 to give us some specific examples of what this looks like."}
{"source": "As Paul says in Romans 8 verses 5 to 6, he says, those who live according to the flesh, set their minds on the things of the flesh."}
{"source": "In Mark chapter 12, he was asked which commandment of the Mosaic law was the most important, and here's what Jesus said."}
{"source": "This is Mark 12, verse 29 to 31."}
{"source": "In fact, later on in the book of Romans, Paul echoes that same idea in Romans 13, verses 8 to 9."}
{"source": "And so as the Old Testament moves on, you see that the prophets, prophets like Jeremiah, prophets like Ezekiel, they began to see a coming day when God would intervene, when he would change the nature of his relationship with his people, a time when God would move to actually give his people the ability to love him and to keep his commandments."}
{"source": "And so here in Romans 8, we see that that is exactly what God has done for us."}
{"source": "But as we've seen here in Romans 8, God has given us spiritual life through the death of his son and the powerful presence of his life-giving spirit."}
{"source": "In Genesis chapter 3, we see the serpent in the garden puts to the very first humans the question, who can you believe?"}
{"source": "And what we've been seeing for the past few months is that the church to which the New Testament letter of 1 John was written had been through something of a crisis of authority."}
{"source": "They began to teach a different message than the message that was delivered to this church by John and the other apostles."}
{"source": "And in our passage for this morning from 1 John 4, John's going to tell us how, when it comes to matters of faith, we can decide."}
{"source": "We'll be referring back to 1 John 4, 1 to 6 repeatedly."}
{"source": "John says this."}
{"source": "So the command at the very outset is that the believers in this church should not, John says, believe every spirit."}
{"source": "It seems that the challenge was that some of John's first readers were prone to uncritically accept any teaching that claimed to be made in the name of Christ."}
{"source": "But John commands them there in the middle of verse 1 to evaluate, to assess with a critical eye."}
{"source": "John sees that different teaching is inspired."}
{"source": "This is not a new issue in John's day."}
{"source": "So for just one example, in Matthew chapter 7, Jesus tells his followers this."}
{"source": "He tells, it says that they must, this is Matthew 7 verse 13, enter by the narrow gate for the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction."}
{"source": "You have to walk the hard path in the very next verses in Matthew 7 15."}
{"source": "John says, test the spirits, and then he says, for many false prophets have gone out into the world."}
{"source": "But I think this makes sense in the context of the community to which John is writing."}
{"source": "Some false teachers and some of their followers went out from the congregation, as John says back in first John 2 19."}
{"source": "So this letter first John is written in an attempt to encourage and instruct those who were left behind."}
{"source": "John's trying to help them understand what's happened and to keep them spiritually safe as they move forward."}
{"source": "John says, those false teachers, those false prophets that went out from you, their proof that Jesus is warning was necessary."}
{"source": "John says, don't be gullible, don't be easily duped, don't be taken in by claims and appearances."}
{"source": "There are people who are trying to deceive you, as John's already told us back in first John 2, 26."}
{"source": "The one that Jesus proclaimed, the one that Paul proclaimed, the one that John and the other apostles proclaimed, right?"}
{"source": "We've seen this message so far in first John, it's the, it's the message of a world trapped in sin under the power of the evil one."}
{"source": "As John says in first John 5, 19, it's the message of God's great love that he would send on, send his son to take on human flesh for us, to bring us eternal life and forgiveness for our sins."}
{"source": "As he tells us in first John one, two, right?"}
{"source": "The only message that can save is the message of Jesus Christ, the righteous, the one who gave up his life on the cross as a substitute for our sins, as a sacrifice for us, as a propitiation for our sins, as John says in first John two, two."}
{"source": "The only message that can save is the message of Jesus physically raised from the dead in victory over sin and death ascended into heaven where he intercedes for us now and advocates on our behalf before the father, as John tells us in first John two, two."}
{"source": "As John tells us in first John three, one to two brothers and sisters, there is no other message that can save you."}
{"source": "The churches in Galatia in the time of the Bible were being plagued by a different group of false teachers than the one that John's writing about."}
{"source": "But the apostle Paul shared John's concern about the danger of false teachers and false messages."}
{"source": "And so he writes in Galatians one, starting in the middle of verse seven, he tells the church there, there are some who trouble you."}
{"source": "So John warns us here, do not believe every spirit."}
{"source": "As John says there in verse one, do not believe every spirit."}
{"source": "John tells us there in verses two to three, he writes by this, you know, the spirit of God, every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God."}
{"source": "John says by this, you know."}
{"source": "What does it mean when John says that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh, or as we could translate it, Jesus is the Christ who has come in the flesh."}
{"source": "And so it seems that some of these false teachers that had gone out from John's church had claimed that the spirit of the Messiah, the Christ, had come upon Jesus at his baptism."}
{"source": "But here John's insisting that that's not true."}
{"source": "The tense of the verb that John uses there when he says, has come, in verse 2, every spirit that confesses that Jesus has come, the tense of that verb there gives the sense that the humanity, the flesh that Jesus took on at his incarnation is his permanent possession."}
{"source": "John is saying that the son of God became a man."}
{"source": "If the son of God wasn't born as a human infant, if he wasn't made manifest in a way that we could see with our eyes and touch with our hands, as John said back at the very beginning of his letter, then Jesus could not serve as our representative."}
{"source": "If Jesus wasn't fully God and fully man on the cross, he could not be the atoning sacrifice, the propitiation for our sins, as John says back in 1 John 2."}
{"source": "John says, you know, it doesn't come from God's spirit."}
{"source": "There at the end of verse three, John tells us such teaching comes from the spirit of the Antichrist, which is in the world already."}
{"source": "If you remember a few weeks back when we thought about 1 John 2.18, we saw the New Testament talks about a great deceiver who will arise at the very end of history in the period of time immediately preceding Jesus's return."}
{"source": "But we also saw back in 1 John 2.18, there's a sense in which there will be a number of smaller, lesser, sort of lowercase a Antichrists, deceivers who share in the spirit, the ethos, the methodology of the Antichrist, deceivers who may not have the Antichrist's power and final influence, but who work in ways that are consistent with his goals and methods."}
{"source": "Remember we're examining John's words there in verse two, every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God."}
{"source": "We're reminded in James chapter two, even the demons believe the truths of the gospel and shudder at them."}
{"source": "The confession that John's talking about here in verse two, it's not a sort of bloodless cold assertion of facts, but it's a heart commitment."}
{"source": "John's goal here is that we would not believe every spirit, but that we would test the spirits to see whether they're from God."}
{"source": "In the original context of first John, he wants his readers to ignore those false teachers, those who had gone out from them."}
{"source": "John wants them to listen instead to him."}
{"source": "John contrasts the teaching of the false prophets, he calls them they, and the teaching of the apostles, he refers to them as we."}
{"source": "Therefore it should be no surprise when John tells us in verse five that the world listens to them."}
{"source": "We, the apostles, John says there in verse six, are from God."}
{"source": "That's John's resume."}
{"source": "John doesn't say listen to me, not them."}
{"source": "See that in verse five, John and the apostles are from God."}
{"source": "John says, the people of the world listen to the world."}
{"source": "Test the spirits, John says."}
{"source": "So there in verse 4, John reminds his readers of two truths about them."}
{"source": "John wants them to think for a moment about their spiritual condition."}
{"source": "In a world that lies under the power of the evil one, John says they are from God."}
{"source": "And so John's readers, the members of the church who had ousted these false teachers and who had remained faithful to the apostolic gospel, they held on tightly to that confession, even though there was great pressure to abandon it."}
{"source": "In the battle between the false teachers and this little, battered, bruised church, John says you won."}
{"source": "Well, John tells us."}
{"source": "See, John understands that everyone in the world has someone in them."}
{"source": "And the encouragement that John has for us this morning, brothers and sisters, is that it is not a fair fight."}
{"source": "1 John 2, 18-27."}
{"source": "We've been considering the New Testament letter of 1 John over the past months."}
{"source": "Some false teachers, and even some of their followers perhaps, went out, as John says in verse 19 of our passage that Natalie just read for us."}
{"source": "And so John is writing to encourage and to instruct those who have been left behind."}
{"source": "And so as we're going to see, John is writing to encourage the church that in fact the Jesus that had been proclaimed to them was all that they needed."}
{"source": "John writes this."}
{"source": "So John tells us twice there that it is the last hour."}
{"source": "When John says that this is the last hour, he's not saying, like, literally we've got an hour before Jesus comes back."}
{"source": "And so these are the last days, or as John puts it here to sort of heighten the urgency and the drama, it is the last hour."}
{"source": "The way we know that that's true, according to John in verse 18, is the presence of Antichrist."}
{"source": "So Jesus, particularly in Mark's gospel and in Matthew chapter 24, he warns us about false prophets, false Christs who will come in order to deceive people with great signs and wonders."}
{"source": "In 2 Thessalonians 2, Paul writes about a lawless one who will deceive many before he's ultimately vanquished by Jesus at his coming."}
{"source": "In Revelation 12 and 13, we read about a beast who deceives the earth and makes war against the followers of Jesus."}
{"source": "But what John's telling us here is that there's also a sense in which there will be a massive number of smaller, lesser Antichrists along the way."}
{"source": "So Jesus and Paul and Revelation point us forward to a sort of capital A Antichrist, this sort of figure of deception who will oppose God and his people."}
{"source": "And what John's telling us here is that's true."}
{"source": "So John reminds them here in verse 18, you've heard that the Antichrist capital a, the big one is coming, he says, and so many little Antichrists have already come."}
{"source": "Now why is John bringing this up?"}
{"source": "The Antichrist that John has in his mind are the false teachers that had plagued this church and who had recently left."}
{"source": "John's saying they are deceivers."}
{"source": "There in verse 19, John says that their departure from the church served the purpose of demonstrating that they had never really belonged to the company of faithful believers."}
{"source": "So we read there in 1 John 2.19, speaking of these false teachers, these deceivers, these Antichrists, they went out from us, but they were not of us."}
{"source": "Now don't misunderstand what John's saying here."}
{"source": "That's not what John is saying here."}
{"source": "We've already seen in 1 John some examples that these false teachers, these little antichrists, in chapter 1, verse 6, we see that they walked in the darkness."}
{"source": "They claimed to have no sin, 1 John 1.8."}
{"source": "They failed to keep God's commandments, 1 John 2.4."}
{"source": "They hated their brothers and sisters, 1 John 2.11."}
{"source": "They loved the world, 1 John 2.15."}
{"source": "John says, who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ?"}
{"source": "That's what makes John call these teachers out."}
{"source": "And what we see here is that for John, the idea of Jesus being the Christ is tied up with the idea that he is the son of God."}
{"source": "We even saw that in Psalm 2, where it talks about the king also being the son of God."}
{"source": "John seems to pick up on that idea here at the end of verse 22."}
{"source": "John says that's tantamount to denying the father as well."}
{"source": "So John says there in verse 23, no one who denies the son has the father."}
{"source": "Later on in 1 John, we'll see that he talks on one hand about denying that Jesus has come in the flesh."}
{"source": "And in 2 John 7, we read this helpful parallel to what John writes here."}
{"source": "2 John 7, he says, for many deceivers have gone out into the world."}
{"source": "So in Colossians, the apostle Paul writes this in Colossians chapter one, starting in verse 15, speaking of Jesus, he is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation for by him, all things were created in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities, all things were created through him and for him."}
{"source": "Okay, now add to that what the author of Hebrews says in Hebrews chapter one, starting in verse one, long ago at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets."}
{"source": "And one more in John's revelation, he describes a vision that he has of Jesus."}
{"source": "So what's obvious from those passages and from what John says here in 1 John 2 is that you cannot fail to do justice to the glory and the majesty and the divinity of Jesus."}
{"source": "If someone claims to be a Christian but denies those fundamental truths about Jesus's identity, even if they seem pro-Jesus, even if they say nice things about him, even if they are genuinely nice people and are very sincere in their belief, according to John, according to God's word, they are a liar."}
{"source": "John says that if we deny Jesus the glory and the honor that he is due, we deny God the father as well."}
{"source": "John says that person is a liar par excellence."}
{"source": "Let's move on and see what John says about the truth that they had heard."}
{"source": "John isn't worried that his readers don't know the truth, that they don't know what he's talking about."}
{"source": "Why is John confident that they know the truth?"}
{"source": "Look there at the beginning of verse 24, John says, let what you heard from the beginning abide in you."}
{"source": "Well, it's the message that was preached to them by John himself."}
{"source": "He offers eternal life, as John says there in verse 25, to anyone who will turn from their sins and put their trust in him."}
{"source": "Romans 10, 17 tells us that faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ."}
{"source": "And so look at what John tells the church to do with this message that they'd heard from the beginning."}
{"source": "There in verse 24, John tells us what to do with this message."}
{"source": "John says this message must abide."}
{"source": "And when it does, if it does, John tells us something extraordinary there at the end of verse 24."}
{"source": "In the gospel message, the truth about Jesus the Christ, when it abides in you, when it remains in you, when it lives in you, John says, you abide, you remain, you live in the Son and in the Father."}
{"source": "You see what John's saying to the church?"}
{"source": "So if you're not a follower of Jesus, if what John is talking about here is not yet true of you, if you have not confessed yet that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God in human flesh, the Redeemer sent by God to save you, if the message of his death and resurrection to bring about your salvation, if that hasn't taken up residence in your life and recreated you at a spiritual level, then friend, this is where you begin."}
{"source": "We would love to help you understand the message that John's readers heard from the beginning."}
{"source": "John wants this message to abide in us as individuals and as a church."}
{"source": "But none of those things come with the promise that John mentions there in verse 25."}
{"source": "So John affirms there at the end of verse 20 that the church has everything that it needs."}
{"source": "If you remember back in the Old Testament, in Jeremiah 31, the Lord made a promise to his people, a promise that he was going to inaugurate a new covenant."}
{"source": "And here, John is confident that that's true of the church."}
{"source": "But here John says, you've been anointed."}
{"source": "So here John's turning their language on its head."}
{"source": "In John's gospel, the Holy One is used, that phrase, that term, that name is used of Jesus himself."}
{"source": "You see that in John 6, verse 69."}
{"source": "It's likely that John sees believers as having something, or we should probably say someone poured out on them by Jesus himself, by the Holy One."}
{"source": "We see that in Luke chapter 4, where Jesus points back to a prophecy from Isaiah that he was fulfilling to the effect that the Holy Spirit had been poured out on him."}
{"source": "We see this truth in Peter's preaching in Acts chapter 10, where he says that God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit."}
{"source": "So what John is saying here is that if you are a believer, then Jesus himself has poured out God the Holy Spirit on you, into your life, into your soul, into your mind, into your heart."}
{"source": "John makes the point clear there in verse 27."}
{"source": "John says you've been anointed, you've been smeared, you've been rubbed, you've been soaked with an anointing that you received from Jesus himself, and that anointing is the Holy Spirit, the one that Jesus promised would teach us, and bring to mind all truth and all knowledge."}
{"source": "John says you're not lacking in anything because you have the Holy Spirit."}
{"source": "That's obviously not what John's saying."}
{"source": "And part of the work that the Holy Spirit does, according to Ephesians chapter 4, is to give some people in the church the gift of teaching, so that the church can be instructed and edified and built up."}
{"source": "Instead, what John is saying here is that you don't need to be taught."}
{"source": "John says, abide in him."}
{"source": "And here John says we are to abide in him."}
{"source": "On the first read, it might seem like John's telling us to abide in the Holy Spirit."}
{"source": "So John reminds them, he reminds us, you have what you need."}
{"source": "That's the encouragement that Paul gives to the church at Corinth in 1 Corinthians 11, 28."}
{"source": "The sermon passage this morning is from 1 John 5, verses 16 through 19, and that can be found on page 1023 on your blue Bible in front of you."}
{"source": "So you might remember in Matthew chapter 7 that the Lord Jesus talks in terms of paths."}
{"source": "First Corinthians chapter 9, the Apostle Paul picks up a bit on this same imagery."}
{"source": "In 1st John, the apostle tells us about the world, the flesh and the devil conspiring to oppose us at every step on our pilgrimage."}
{"source": "In Hebrews 10, we read about those who shrink back from the faith and are destroyed."}
{"source": "And if you've been here for this series of sermons in the book of 1st John, you know that this was a very live issue for the church to which John was writing."}
{"source": "John tells us about them in 1st John 2, 26."}
{"source": "And so John was writing to strengthen, to encourage, to embolden these faithful church members, that they had done the right thing, that by staying faithful to the message that the apostles had proclaimed to them, that they had made the right choice."}
{"source": "John wants them to have assurance, to know that they're on the right side when it comes to spiritual matters."}
{"source": "So last time we were in 1st John, the apostle gave his readers his reason for writing."}
{"source": "And so as we come near to the end of John's letter, we see that he's going to visit yet again the need for vigilance when it comes to spiritual matters and particular in particular, he wants to warn them about the danger that sin poses to their spiritual well-being."}
{"source": "It's as if John's saying that, look, as you run your race, as you as you go on the path marked out for you, there are bikes and cars and buses littered all over the race route."}
{"source": "So if you remember where we left off in first, John, the apostle has been encouraging believers to have confidence when they go to their heavenly father in prayer."}
{"source": "So in first John, chapter five, verse 14, we read this."}
{"source": "Now, moving on from that in our passage, John moves on to a specific situation in which we should ask something of the Lord."}
{"source": "I've got problems at my job."}
{"source": "You've got problems at your job."}
{"source": "But I think if we move slowly through this passage, I think we can we can get on solid footing and understand what John is talking about here."}
{"source": "So there in verse 16, John says that if we see a certain situation in the life of the church, we shall ask."}
{"source": "So the verb form that John uses there when he says he shall ask, it indicates not so much a command."}
{"source": "John's not telling us to ask."}
{"source": "So in this scenario that John is envisioning, a believer will ask."}
{"source": "We're talking about making our requests known to our heavenly father with, as John's told us, the confidence that he hears us and that we have what we've asked of him."}
{"source": "John's not saying males."}
{"source": "So if you see your brother or your sister doing something, John's saying you should ask God and God will, in response, give him or her life."}
{"source": "Well, John says there in verse 16 at the beginning that we see them committing a sin, not leading to death."}
{"source": "John repeats it again that do not lead to death."}
{"source": "If John says, look, there's a sin that doesn't seems to indicate that there's also a sin that does."}
{"source": "And in fact, at the end of verse 16, John affirms that for us, he says, there is a sin that leads to death."}
{"source": "That seems to be what John's pointing out there in verse 17, when he reminds us that all wrongdoing is sin."}
{"source": "John says there in verse 17, all wrongdoing is sin."}
{"source": "And yet, however, John does seem to expect that his readers will understand him when he tells them that there are actually different kinds of sin, sin that does lead to death and sin that doesn't."}
{"source": "And perhaps the best path forward is to see if we can figure out what John means by a sin that leads to death, right?"}
{"source": "Some people have said that when John talks about the sin that leads to death, he's talking about a sin that is so egregious, so offensive to God, that God responds by taking that person's life immediately as a response."}
{"source": "Think about Acts chapter 5, where Ananias and Sapphira lie to the Holy Spirit and immediately die as a result."}
{"source": "Think about Acts chapter 12, where King Herod is struck down for accepting worship and glory from the crowds."}
{"source": "But that's most likely not what John's talking about in our passage."}
{"source": "When John talks about life and death in his letter, he is always talking in terms of spiritual life and spiritual death."}
{"source": "Others have suggested that John is referring to the distinction that we see in the Old Testament law between unintentional sins, things that one of God's people might do sort of by accident or without knowing, and on the other hand, sins that are committed with a high hand, that is to say, a brazen or defiant sin."}
{"source": "And while that's possible, there's really nothing that John says in this passage that would lead us to think that that's what he's talking about."}
{"source": "And so if we step back for a second and look at the larger context of 1 John and try to put this sin that leads to death into that context, I think we can sort of figure things out here."}
{"source": "So John's main concern in this letter, right, he's been addressing a church where false teachers and their followers have just defected, and he's been addressing a church where false teachers and their followers have just defected, and he's writing to make sure that the remaining church, the ones who were still faithful to the confession that Jesus is the son of God, the Christ, come in the flesh to save us, right, this is the church that was still fighting against sin in their lives, confessing sin, committing themselves to obeying the Lord and his commands."}
{"source": "John wants these people to have confidence that they have life, and he wants them to know that the people who have denied Christ, the people who have refused to obey his commands, the people who show no love for the people in the church, John wants the congregation to know that those people who left, they don't have life because they don't have Jesus."}
{"source": "Remember, this is what we've already seen in 1 John, in chapter 3, verse 14."}
{"source": "John says, we know that we've passed out of death into life because we love the brothers."}
{"source": "In 1 John 5, 12, whoever has the son has life."}
{"source": "I think in that larger context, it would seem that what John means by a sin that leads to death is not sort of one discrete action or even an attitude that one might unintentionally commit or sort of slip into."}
{"source": "I think in short, the sin that leads to death is the behavior of the false teachers, the very things that John's been speaking about for this whole letter, right?"}
{"source": "Back in chapter one, John says, if we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us."}
{"source": "If you think about it, we've all committed all of the sins that John's been talking about in this letter."}
{"source": "Well, again, John's told us earlier in this letter back in chapter one, if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."}
{"source": "If you look there in verse 16, it's clear that John understands that when sin enters into our lives, one of the ways that the Lord protects us, one of the ways that the Lord cares for us is by giving us brothers and sisters in the church who will pray for us."}
{"source": "And John says there in verse 16, in response to those prayers, God will give us life."}
{"source": "Now, just briefly, I've got to mention there at the end of verse 16, John does say something, again, a bit confusing."}
{"source": "But just as John actually isn't telling the church not to pray, he's not saying don't pray for the people who've who've left."}
{"source": "But but given that you can't pray for everyone all the time everywhere, John here is concerned that the church pray for one another, that the church prays for people who actually want to follow Jesus."}
{"source": "So if you step back, I think you see that John has a vision of congregational life that may be challenging to us as we live as Christians in 21st century America."}
{"source": "But here, John assumes more than just that."}
{"source": "I think one of the ways we live out what John is pointing to here in verse 16 is through our weekly prayer of confession."}
{"source": "John has been repeatedly pointing us to love for one another as a key expression of the life of Christ in us."}
{"source": "John says, do you love your brothers?"}
{"source": "So, again, we've already begun to touch on this with the emphasis that John places on prayer, but they're in verses 18 to 19."}
{"source": "John sets the stage for us there in verse 19."}
{"source": "There are two sides, John says, the world lies in the power of the evil one."}
{"source": "And so John is reminding us that that there's nothing out there worth envying."}
{"source": "John says they've gone out into the world, the whole world lies in the power of the evil one."}
{"source": "Even today, right now, God extends salvation to you through his son, you can be, in John's words, born of God, you can be sheltered from the devil who seeks to do you permanent spiritual harm."}
{"source": "We see that John contrasts the world to his readers, that the world lies in the power of the evil one."}
{"source": "But he says we there in verse 19, John associates himself with the church and its members."}
{"source": "We know that we are from God, we're not, John says, under the power of the evil one."}
{"source": "John has raised the specter of sin that leads to death."}
{"source": "How does John know that?"}
{"source": "Well, because of the three tests that he's been putting forward throughout his letter, because John knows that these church members love one another."}
{"source": "And so here at the end of his letter, John is telling them essentially that after having gone through all the evidence, even though they are weak, even though they are prone to stumbling, even though they have sin that they need to confess."}
{"source": "So John says, we know that we're from God."}
{"source": "So everyone born of God, everyone who has received new spiritual life as a free gift from God, that person's spiritual life is characterized by the fact, John says there, that they do not keep on sinning."}
{"source": "So we've seen this throughout John's letter."}
{"source": "We don't keep on sinning, as John says there in verse 18."}
{"source": "But praise God there in verse 18, John says that the evil one doesn't touch the person who's been born of God."}
{"source": "Well, John tells us there in the middle of verse 18, it's because we are protected by he who was born of God."}
{"source": "It could be that John's talking about a fellow believer there, like back in verse 16, a fellow believer who prays on our behalf."}
{"source": "But in every way that ultimately matters, John reminds us here and encourages us, he cannot touch us."}
{"source": "Back in chapter four, John told us, little children, you are from God and have overcome them."}
{"source": "In his little letter, Jude tells us in Jude 24 that God is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before the presence of his glory with great joy."}
{"source": "Jude tells us that God keeps us."}
{"source": "This is the truth that Jesus is talking about in John, chapter 10, where he speaks of his disciples in terms of sheep."}
{"source": "It's here that we live out the faith that overcomes the world and the evil one, as John puts it in First John 5 5."}
{"source": "Now, before we come to the table, it's appropriate to take a moment to examine our lives, to to pray about our sin, as we've been thinking about in this passage from 1 John chapter 5."}
{"source": "Paul in 1 Corinthians 11 tells the church explicitly to examine yourselves before you come to the table."}
{"source": "If you claim to be a follower of Jesus, but your life is is inconsistent with what we've been seeing in First John, if your life is marked by sin that you have no intention of turning from or repenting of, if you hold bitterness and hatred in your heart towards a brother or sister and you have no intention of turning from it."}
{"source": "Today's sermon passage comes from 1 Thessalonians, starting in chapter 2, verse 17, to chapter 3, ending in verse 13."}
{"source": "So if you are just joining us for our series in First Thessalonians, let me just catch you up to speed."}
{"source": "Look, think of what the Apostle Peter says in 1 Peter chapter 4, verses 12 to 13."}
{"source": "It's from that job interview."}
{"source": "Congratulations, you've got the job."}
{"source": "He doesn't, he doesn't receive this report from Timothy and go, wow, I have done an awesome job discipling these guys."}
{"source": "Second Corinthians 1.14."}
{"source": "Philippians chapter four, verse one, therefore, my brothers, whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm thus in the Lord, my beloved."}
{"source": "When God holds us accountable for our sins, it will be nothing like the wicked acts of Nazis or terrorists."}
{"source": "This is actually one of, this is the first of four such lists that Paul can have rights just in this letter in second Corinthians."}
{"source": "If you, if you've read the book of Acts, for example, you'll see that this actually happened to Paul quite often."}
{"source": "If you remember back in Acts chapter nine, the risen Jesus had said to a man named Ananias referring to Paul in Acts nine 16, Jesus said, for, I will show him that as Paul, how much he must suffer for the sake of my name."}
{"source": "This is what Paul had said back in 2 Corinthians 1, verse 5, when he said, we share abundantly in Christ's sufferings, right?"}
{"source": "There in verse 13, Paul quotes from Psalm 116."}
{"source": "The psalmist there in Psalm 116 says that he had faith to speak about the Lord, even in great personal affliction."}
{"source": "As I'm reading Psalm 116, I say, hey, that's us."}
{"source": "We saw it back when we were studying first Corinthians in first Corinthians 15, right?"}
{"source": "In first Corinthians 1520, Paul calls Jesus in his resurrection, the first fruits, right?"}
{"source": "We saw this earlier in our service reading from First Thessalonians chapter four."}
{"source": "Remember what Paul told the Philippians as he contemplated his death?"}
{"source": "As Jude says in Jude 24, we will be in his presence with great joy."}
{"source": "And in First Corinthians, the Apostle Paul encourages the members of the church to examine themselves before they come to the table."}
{"source": "Please turn with me in your Bibles to 1 Thessalonians 4, 13-18."}
{"source": "So if you're just joining us for our series in First Thessalonians, let me just catch you up to speed."}
{"source": "For example, in Acts chapter seven, when Stephen is stoned to death for preaching the gospel, we read this, I'm falling to his knees."}
{"source": "Well notice Jesus' words in John 11."}
{"source": "We even remember the apostle Paul's words in first Corinthians 15, which we read earlier in our service."}
{"source": "Paul makes the same point in 1 Corinthians 15, which we read earlier on in our service."}
{"source": "Or maybe Paul received this revelation directly from Jesus himself."}
{"source": "On the one hand, it referred to the coming of a hidden divinity, a God who makes his appearance known by a revelation of his power."}
{"source": "So think of just even some of the major events in the Bible, like the Exodus, Mount Sinai, the filling of the tabernacle or the temple, the transfiguration, the ascension, all of those events have a cloud signifying God's presence."}
{"source": "In Daniel chapter 7, we read of the Messiah who will come on the clouds to establish his eternal kingdom."}
{"source": "In other words, it seems as though Paul expects us to meet the Lord in the air and then promptly return with him as he judges the world and establishes his kingdom on earth."}
{"source": "The scripture reading for today is found in 1 John 2, 7-14, which can be found on page 1021 in your CBAC Bibles."}
{"source": "This morning we continue on in the New Testament letter of 1 John."}
{"source": "If you remember the situation and the setting here, our author is John the Apostle, part of Jesus' inner circle of twelve disciples."}
{"source": "He's also the author of the Gospel according to John, one of the four biographies that we have in the Bible that tell us about Jesus' life and death, his teaching, his resurrection."}
{"source": "So of the four Gospel accounts of Jesus' life, John is the latest, probably by a couple of decades."}
{"source": "We think it was written most likely in the early 80s A.D., and it seems like the letter that we call 1 John, that we're studying on our Sunday mornings together, was written at least in part to correct or to clarify some ways that John's Gospel account had been misunderstood or misapplied."}
{"source": "We don't have a date on this letter, but the evidence that we have leads us to believe that it was probably written in the early 90s A.D., so about maybe ten years, a decade after John's Gospel was written."}
{"source": "This would have been the very end of John's life."}
{"source": "And in terms of what motivated John to write this letter, as I mentioned, it does seem that there was some error that had crept into the church, particularly in the form of false teachers."}
{"source": "In chapter 2, verse 26, John talks about people who are trying to deceive you."}
{"source": "And so throughout the letter, we see the Apostle John addressing these false teachers and the effect that they had on the church, the ways that they destabilized the faith and the confidence of the people there, particularly in what they had been taught by the Apostle."}
{"source": "And so John, in this letter, is concerned to give his readers, to give the sort of faithful faction that hadn't gone off after these false teachers, he wants to give them some criteria for evaluating themselves, some criteria for even understanding and evaluating other teachers."}
{"source": "John says that anyone who claims to know the Lord, but doesn't have any interest in keeping his commands, John says he's a liar, and the truth isn't in him."}
{"source": "But on the other hand, John says if someone does keep the Lord's commands, right, not perfectly, John makes it clear that that won't be the case until we get to heaven."}
{"source": "They encourage us to look at our own claim to know God and to walk in his light, and to hold that claim up to the tests that John's giving us."}
{"source": "And so as we approach these verses, I want to start by actually starting at the end of the passage, looking there in verses 12 to 14 to see what John says about why it is that he's writing to the congregation."}
{"source": "And then we'll move on to look at the importance of love for our brothers and sisters that John talks about in verses 7 to 11."}
{"source": "John writes, I am writing to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven for his name's sake."}
{"source": "John is cruising along, he's saying lots of things that we expect apostles to say, right?"}
{"source": "Let's begin by looking at what he actually says here in verses 12 to 14, and then maybe we can figure out how it fits into the larger message of 1 John."}
{"source": "You might notice that there's some structure, there's some repetition in what John says here."}
{"source": "I think that's what John's doing here."}
{"source": "So you have these three groups of people, little children or children, people that John's addressing as fathers, and then people that John is addressing as young men."}
{"source": "But I think the majority interpretation here is that John is speaking probably not to groups of people with literally different ages in the church, but rather he's speaking to people with different degrees of spiritual maturity."}
{"source": "Now, to be clear, I don't think we should think specifically in terms of gender here, as if John only intends to address the males in the congregation."}
{"source": "Whether John is addressing people in different stages of life or different stages of spiritual maturity ultimately doesn't matter too much, because what's important is what he says to them and how he describes them."}
{"source": "And so John here says, for the sake of his name, for the sake of who Jesus is and what he did for us on the cross, he says, we have been forgiven."}
{"source": "The tense of the verb that John uses there indicates that the sins that he's thinking about, they were forgiven and they still remain forgiven."}
{"source": "We see John addresses the little children again a bit later in verse 13, saying that they know the Father."}
{"source": "It seems like John's describing the first steps, the very first joyous experiences of the Christian life."}
{"source": "John addresses the young men there in the middle of verse 13."}
{"source": "John says the word of God abides in them."}
{"source": "And so John rejoices because they've overcome the evil one."}
{"source": "John suggests this is a term sort of indicating leaders in the church, but he says there that they know him who is from the beginning, in the beginning of verse 13."}
{"source": "What they're left with now is a mature and deep knowledge, a personal and intimate relationship with him, John says, who was or who is from the beginning."}
{"source": "Now, if you remember back to the very opening of this letter, John speaks about the word of life as being from the beginning."}
{"source": "And so it seems here that John's pointing out that these mature saints are characterized by a knowledge of him."}
{"source": "Perhaps a knowledge that even John's saying extends all the way back into the time of Jesus's earthly ministry."}
{"source": "But when you put it all together, what's clear is that John is writing to this group of people and he is confident in them, whether they are young or old in the faith, new believers or the most seasoned disciples."}
{"source": "I think it's important because in a couple of weeks, we're going to see, Lord willing, that John is going to strongly warn the church against loving the things of the world."}
{"source": "And we have to remember that that command, and really all the commands in 1 John, they stand on this foundation."}
{"source": "They come in the context of John's confidence that his readers have come to know Jesus, that they've overcome the evil one, that they've triumphed through his victory over sin and death."}
{"source": "I think it's also important because John, you may have noticed already, he speaks a lot in conditionals, right?"}
{"source": "The letter of 1 John is full of these kinds of conditionals."}
{"source": "That they somehow depend on our ability to check off a list, to fulfill all of the ifs that John's giving us here."}
{"source": "Now, of course, what John is saying is true, but he's not saying it in order to destabilize your confidence in God's salvation."}
{"source": "John's words here in chapter 2, verses 12 to 14, they're meant to stir up your confidence."}
{"source": "You no less than John's first readers have been forgiven and God's word abides in you and you are strong and you know him and you've overcome the evil one who seeks to deceive you and to keep you from faith in Christ."}
{"source": "So whatever warnings or corrections John might have for us, they come to people who belong to Jesus."}
{"source": "In the same way, John's pointing out that the love and the faithfulness, the walking in the light, knowing that his readers are rooted in Christ, that they have everything they need, that they are going to win."}
{"source": "Well, if you're getting sort of used to John's writing style here, you may notice that he gets to his point in a pretty roundabout fashion."}
{"source": "So John says, I have a commandment for you."}
{"source": "That wouldn't make sense in this context, since John's readers haven't been around that long."}
{"source": "But instead of telling us what it is there in verse eight, John tells us that this old command, that's not a new command, it actually is a new command."}
{"source": "To which we say, did the John who wrote verse seven meet the John who wrote verse eight?"}
{"source": "In verses nine to 10, we do finally get some sense of what John's talking about here."}
{"source": "So again, this is one of John's favorite ways to poke at the false teachers, right?"}
{"source": "And John keeps saying their life doesn't back it up."}
{"source": "So remember, John's told us that God is light in first John one five, right?"}
{"source": "John says, if anyone makes that claim there in verse nine, but he hates his brother, whoever says he's in the light and hates his brother, verse nine is still in the darkness, right?"}
{"source": "John says, whoever says he's in the light and hates his brother is still in the darkness, right?"}
{"source": "John says, whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness and does not know where he is going because the darkness has blinded his eyes, right?"}
{"source": "Whoever hates his brother, John says, is in the darkness."}
{"source": "John goes on in verse 11."}
{"source": "John says, they don't even know where they're going, right?"}
{"source": "John says, they don't even know where they're going."}
{"source": "The end of verse 11, John says, the darkness has blinded their eyes, right?"}
{"source": "John says, cause they hate their brother."}
{"source": "So we see that this old new command that John wants to give to the church, it has something to do with not hating your brother."}
{"source": "And there in verse 10, John tells us more that the one who hates his brother is in the darkness."}
{"source": "The one who loves is not in darkness, but John says he abides in the light."}
{"source": "There is nothing, John says, to cause that person to stumble spiritually."}
{"source": "So let's ask some questions of what John says here."}
{"source": "So we read in John's gospel account in John chapter 13."}
{"source": "But there's also a sense in which this was an old commandment for John's readers."}
{"source": "This message of love for one another, it has deep roots all the way back into the Old Testament where God's people are commanded to love one another in Leviticus 19, right?"}
{"source": "So what does John mean when he says there in verse eight that this command is true in him and he says in you, it's a strange statement."}
{"source": "So when John talks about the command to love our brothers and sisters, he says that this command is true in him."}
{"source": "So John says there in verse 8, this new commandment I'm writing to you is true in him."}
{"source": "Can you see how John says this command to love other people?"}
{"source": "In John's gospel, he says in John 15 verse 12, this is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you."}
{"source": "John makes it clear a bit later on in this letter that this is exactly the kind of love he's thinking about."}
{"source": "In 1 John 3 verse 16, it says, by this we know love, that he, Jesus, laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers."}
{"source": "John makes it clear, this command to love one another, what does it look like?"}
{"source": "So this command, Jesus says, is true in him, and not only is it true in him, but there in verse 8, John says that it's true in you as well."}
{"source": "We might be tempted to take it for granted because it's familiar to us, but what John is saying here and what the rest of the New Testament confirms is that the love that Jesus showed to us at the cross, if you've really experienced it, if that love has made its way into your soul, if the fresh breeze of God's forgiveness and mercy in Christ has blown through your life, it will change you into his image."}
{"source": "You will, as John says earlier in this letter, walk in the way that he walked."}
{"source": "Weren't we in 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 and basically Seth said the same thing?"}
{"source": "But it does strike me that Paul's instructions to the Thessalonians and John's words here, while they're driving at the same idea that Christians ought to love one another, they do have slightly different emphases."}
{"source": "There in 1 Thessalonians, the apostle is addressing love in the context of a temptation to laziness and indifference."}
{"source": "But I think John's dealing with something a bit darker here in the churches that he's writing to."}
{"source": "There in verse 8, John tells us the true light is already shining."}
{"source": "As John says there in verse 8, the darkness is passing away."}
{"source": "And so the old commandment that John speaks of here, this old slash new command to love one another, John's saying this is an invitation to get on board with what the God of the universe is doing through his son."}
{"source": "It is so central to the gospel that to lack love for your brother or sister, John seems to be saying, is to lack the gospel itself."}
{"source": "In this way, the command to love is the word that you heard, as John puts it there in verse 8."}
{"source": "It's the command, John says, you've always known from the very beginning."}
{"source": "If you hate your brother or your sister, John says you're walking in the darkness."}
{"source": "If you've learned to hate those sort of unwanted flare ups of darkness, then John says you're living in the light."}
{"source": "But as John's going to tell us a bit later on in his letter, God is love."}
{"source": "But in our passage for this morning from the book of 2 Corinthians, we see the Apostle Paul responding to some of his critics in the church there."}
{"source": "Some of these themes are gonna be familiar to you if you've been here for this whole series in 2 Corinthians."}
{"source": "Here we really need to have a sense of the background of the letter to 2 Corinthians."}
{"source": "And so one scholar compared it to when we read 2 Corinthians, it's like listening to one side of a telephone conversation, right?"}
{"source": "So a while back when we were studying 1 Corinthians, we saw that chapters one to four really was Paul pushing back against these impulses in the church."}
{"source": "If you remember in 1 Corinthians 1 to 4, Paul insists that the message of the cross is actually weakness."}
{"source": "He says there in 1 Corinthians 1 to 4 that his preaching didn't come in plausible words of wisdom, right, like the sophists, like the teachers that the Corinthians loved so much."}
{"source": "And so as we come to 2 Corinthians 10, it seems that Paul, yet again, has these teachers in his sight, these opponents."}
{"source": "He talks about it in 2 Corinthians chapter 2, verse 1."}
{"source": "Sure, he acts like he's a big man from a distance, but in person, he's nothing."}
{"source": "And really, the rest of this letter, 2 Corinthians, is devoted to Paul pushing back against these false teachers."}
{"source": "He's used this word for boasting 10 times already in 2 Corinthians."}
{"source": "We've seen it over and over again in second Corinthians for Paul, what, what marks out true Christian ministry, true Christian authority, true Christian leadership."}
{"source": "Instead, the one true marker of genuine Christian ministry, according to Paul in second Corinthians is this conformity to the character of Christ walking according to the pattern of life that the Lord Jesus set down for us."}
{"source": "And so your job was to tear down everyone else and then sort of climb over the pile of bodies to the top."}
{"source": "Paul's not running around to some church that Peter planted or that John planted and trying to sort of take control there."}
{"source": "There in verse 17, Paul alludes to a passage from Jeremiah nine in the old Testament."}
{"source": "Let me, let me read to you from Jeremiah nine, verses 23 to 24."}
{"source": "And so they boasted in all of the things that the Lord says not to boast in there in Jeremiah."}
{"source": "The person who boasts in that way, he knows that the Lord delights in what he says there in Jeremiah nine, steadfast love and justice and righteousness."}
{"source": "Remember earlier I mentioned in First Corinthians one to four, Paul contrasted his ministry with that of the sophists."}
{"source": "Well, we read there in First Corinthians chapter two, verses one to five."}
{"source": "Paul says, so this is First Corinthians two, one to five, and I, when I came to you, brothers, did not come proclaiming to you the testimony of God with lofty speech or wisdom, right?"}
{"source": "Well, we've been in a section of 2 Corinthians where the Apostle Paul has in some ways been defending the authority of his ministry, his right to tell the church the true gospel, how to believe and how to respond."}
{"source": "So you have 2 Corinthians 6, verses 11 to 13."}
{"source": "I think if you've been here for this whole series of sermons in 2 Corinthians, what Paul says here should strike you as extraordinary."}
{"source": "We read 1 Corinthians."}
{"source": "We've been studying 2 Corinthians."}
{"source": "We've seen so much of Paul's example here in 2 Corinthians, and each week we're faced with the fact that we're not actually in exactly the same circumstances that Paul was in."}
{"source": "So if you think back to Psalm 1, we read, blessed are the righteous, but then a few verse later, but not so the wicked or the lawless, right?"}
{"source": "So Jacob and Esther Grace were up here earlier leading us in music, and they were harmonizing their voices together, right, making it sound nice."}
{"source": "So for example, in Colossians 1, Paul uses this same word when he says, God, the Father has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in light."}
{"source": "Paul may have in mind a story that we read in 2 Kings 21, where Manasseh, the king of Judah, he sets up carved images of Asherah, a Canaanite deity, and he sets them up in the temple of the Lord."}
{"source": "And so the author of 2 Kings comments on his actions, speaking about the people of Judah, he says, Manasseh led them astray to do more evil than the nations had done, whom the Lord destroyed before the people of Israel."}
{"source": "Romans 1 tells us that all people have a certain knowledge of God that they gain from the world around them and from their own conscience."}
{"source": "He makes it clear in 1 Corinthians 5.10 that that's not what we should be looking for."}
{"source": "Paul is stitching together a promise here by combining Leviticus 26 verses 11 to 12 and Ezekiel 37, 27."}
{"source": "This is a quote from Isaiah 52, which again, another chapter in the Bible that talks about yokes here, talking about the yoke of exile and foreign rule."}
{"source": "God's people here in Isaiah 52 are being called to come out of exile, out of the land of pollution and uncleanness, out of ritual defilement."}
{"source": "And then the promise there at the end comes from Ezekiel 20, verse 41, where God says, when we come out of the world, he will welcome us into his presence."}
{"source": "So here Paul's quoting from 2 Samuel 7, verse 14."}
{"source": "2 Corinthians chapter 7 verse 1."}
{"source": "The fear of God, particularly in the New Testament, has the sense of reverence, awe, sobriety, the appropriate way to feel in light of God's power and his holiness and his mighty acts."}
{"source": "Well, if you have a Bible, if you would open it up to Leviticus chapter 11 or thereabouts, I think it'll be helpful to you to have that open as we're jumping around in these chapters this morning."}
{"source": "Plan is to consider a Leviticus chapters 11 through 15."}
{"source": "And I remember my first day on the job, learning an important lesson."}
{"source": "But in the end, there's no way to do the job that didn't involve getting that on you."}
{"source": "But if you're sitting on the back of the truck, and let's say you're not experienced, this is your first day on the job, right?"}
{"source": "So that's gross, but I've got worse for you today because in the book of Leviticus, we see that the people of Israel had a problem in their relationship with God."}
{"source": "And as we saw last week in Leviticus chapter nine, he was dwelling in their midst, in the tabernacle as their God."}
{"source": "That's been the point of the Bible up until Leviticus nine, we have Abraham's descendants living in the presence of God's glory, enjoying his beauty and his kindness and his protection and his provision, right?"}
{"source": "And so far in the book of Leviticus, we've seen the need for the people of Israel to offer all sorts of sacrifices."}
{"source": "So again, if you have your Bible open Leviticus chapter 11 through chapter 15, we see a series of laws and a series of commands regarding things that made you ritually, ceremonially unclean."}
{"source": "There in chapter 11, if you have your Bible open to Leviticus 11, you see a long list of laws about what kind of foods could be eaten and which couldn't be eaten."}
{"source": "So let me just give you a brief example there in Leviticus chapter 11, starting in verse three, the Lord says, whatever parts the hoof and is cloven footed and chews the cud among the animals you may eat."}
{"source": "So again, just to give you a brief sense of what it says there in Leviticus 12 verses one to four, we read this."}
{"source": "You might remember in the gospel of Luke, in Luke's account of Jesus's life."}
{"source": "He shows us in chapter two, Joseph and Mary bringing the infant Jesus to the temple to perform the various rites that are prescribed here in Leviticus 12 after his birth."}
{"source": "Luke is showing us that this is a law keeping, faithful, obedient family."}
{"source": "In chapters 13 to 14 of Leviticus, you have a series of laws about infections, leprosy."}
{"source": "So again, just for one example, I'm not going to read everything here, but in Leviticus 13, starting in verse nine, when a man is afflicted with a leprous disease, he shall be brought to the priest and the priest shall look."}
{"source": "Towards the end of that chapter in Leviticus 13, uh, 47 to 59, you have laws for garments or blankets that had some kind of pollution in them."}
{"source": "There's all different sorts of ways of, uh, of, um, fixing that problem, remediating that from, you know, a little plaster job all the way to tearing everything down."}
{"source": "So again, in verse 54 of Leviticus 14."}
{"source": "So we read there in verses two to three of Leviticus 15, speak to the people of Israel and say to them, when any man has a discharge from his body, his discharge is unclean, and this is the law of his uncleanness for a discharge, whether his body runs with his discharge or his body is blocked up by his discharge, it is his uncleanness."}
{"source": "And I hope by the end of this time in Leviticus 11 to 15, we'll see clearly that these laws show us something very important about the work of the Lord Jesus."}
{"source": "When you're approaching a book like Leviticus, you have really one of two choices."}
{"source": "What does Leviticus mean?"}
{"source": "This is adapted from Gordon Wenham's commentary on Leviticus."}
{"source": "Leviticus and the tabernacle system presents us with a world that is divided into two realms, right?"}
{"source": "So in terms of understanding all these laws in Leviticus 11 through 15, the Lord is laying out what kinds of things would make an Israelite in that far category of unclean, ritually impure, disqualified from coming into the tabernacle, right?"}
{"source": "This is made explicit there in Leviticus 15 verse 31."}
{"source": "This is the great point that we've reached at the end of Leviticus 9."}
{"source": "So Leviticus 11 verse 7 says this, and the pig, because it parts the hoof and is cloven footed but does not chew the cud, is unclean to you."}
{"source": "Some of the laws here in Leviticus say, look, if you sit on the same cushion that an unclean person sat on, if you sit on their saddle, if you touch something they've touched, their uncleanness gets transferred to you, right?"}
{"source": "It's not just discrete acts of omission or commission."}
{"source": "And so the laws here in Leviticus 11 to 15 give God's people a daily picture of the way that sin ruins everything, of the way that sin excludes us from God's presence, right?"}
{"source": "And so these laws from Leviticus might seem strange to us."}
{"source": "Now before we move on, let me just point out two things that I think are going to help us put these laws in Leviticus 11 to 15 into their proper context."}
{"source": "The Pharisees loved Leviticus 11 to 15."}
{"source": "And so listen to what Jesus says to them in Matthew 15."}
{"source": "This is Matthew 15, starting in verse 10."}
{"source": "This is why when you get to Mark chapter seven, Jesus declares all food clean."}
{"source": "The second thing I'd mentioned here is that the principle behind these chapters in Leviticus, it's not gone away."}
{"source": "But I think the worst way you could read these chapters in Leviticus would be to come away saying, whew, I'm glad God changed his mind."}
{"source": "So when we get to the book of Revelation, we see that God is creating a new world, a new heaven, a new earth with a new city where he will dwell with his people forever."}
{"source": "What we see in Revelation is that tent, that camp back in Sinai in the wilderness 3,000 years ago, it was a shadow."}
{"source": "And what we read about that future city that God is going to create is this, Revelation 21, 27, but nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor anyone who does what is detestable and false, but only those who are written in the Lamb's book of life."}
{"source": "Friends, the distinction between clean and unclean that we see introduced as a shadow here in Leviticus 11 to 15, that distinction continues into eternity, right?"}
{"source": "So at the very end of the Bible, Jesus himself warns in Revelation 22, 15, speaking of this city outside are the dogs and sorcerers and the sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood."}
{"source": "And this is where I want to wrap up this morning because the bulk of Leviticus 11 to 15 is spent describing all of the things that make Israel ritually unclean, but that's not actually the headline."}
{"source": "That's been the case since Genesis three, right since the garden of Eden and mankind's fall into sin."}
{"source": "But there's also an addendum there in Leviticus 12 eight, we read this."}
{"source": "This of course is what we see Mary doing in Luke chapter two, but you're just reminded again the Lord is not cruel."}
{"source": "Leviticus 11 to 15 doesn't break ground by making people unclean and unfit for God's presence."}
{"source": "So I think the best reason for us as a church family to spend time thinking about passages like Leviticus 11 to 15 is that it's in that way that they show us so clearly the nature of the work of the Lord Jesus."}
{"source": "In fact, just reading through the gospels this week, it's really hard to make sense of most of what's going on in the gospels if you're not familiar with the book of Leviticus, right?"}
{"source": "Half the time, what's happening in the gospel accounts of Jesus's life is in some way a response to or a reaction to the law as we see it here in Leviticus."}
{"source": "And so as we conclude this morning, let me point you to a couple of stories in the life of Jesus, particularly in Luke's gospel."}
{"source": "One of them we've already read earlier in our service from Matthew's account."}
{"source": "But in Luke chapter five, we read this about Jesus."}
{"source": "Luke is a physician by trade here, and he tells us this guy, he's not just a leper, he is full of leprosy."}
{"source": "And there's no provision for this in Leviticus."}
{"source": "Now look at Luke chapter eight, a man named Jairus comes to Jesus and he asks him to come to hurry because his daughter is sick and on the point of death."}
{"source": "And on the way to Jairus's house, the crowds are pressing in and we read this in Luke 843."}
{"source": "Again, Luke, the physician says, look, she spent all her money on doctors."}
{"source": "Leviticus 15, verse seven, whoever touches the body of the one with the discharge shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean himself until the evening, right?"}
{"source": "Luke 15, verse 13."}
{"source": "We read there in Luke 8, 44, she came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment and immediately her discharge of blood ceased."}
{"source": "And with the dead girl, Luke 8, 54, but taking her by the hand, he called saying, child arise and her spirit returned and she got up at once."}
{"source": "If you don't, if you don't know Leviticus 11 to 15, you don't understand why this is shocking."}
{"source": "We've read Leviticus."}
{"source": "They serve the same function as the purity code here in Leviticus did."}
{"source": "Those laws in Leviticus make it clear that we are not right with God."}
{"source": "Listen to what the author of Hebrews says."}
{"source": "Hebrews 13 verse 12."}
{"source": "The author of Hebrews makes the point that Jesus was crucified outside the city."}
{"source": "The author of Hebrews says that's where Jesus went to die on the cross."}
{"source": "And the author of Hebrews is saying that's exactly what Jesus has done for you by dying for you outside the city, by taking on himself your defilement and your impurity."}
{"source": "The point of Leviticus 11 to 15 is that you are not clean."}
{"source": "Today's sermon passage is Revelation 5."}
{"source": "That was sort of an introduction because the scene before us in revelation five, which was just read for us, felt too holy for analogy."}
{"source": "The sights and sounds that John hears here in revelation five stand so far above and beyond whatever thing I could place in living color to sort of connect you with that, that it felt like cheapening what God's word actually has for us here."}
{"source": "The book of revelation, if you're, if you're not there in your Bible, you can go ahead and turn there to revelation five."}
{"source": "The book of revelation is a special type of, of book in the Bible called an apocalyptic book."}
{"source": "Actually the word revelation in Greek is apocalypsis."}
{"source": "So I think about a book like revelation or Daniel's, another book like that in the Bible, that God through a, through a, through a inspired writer of the scripture is pulling back the curtain, if you will, and revealing to us real things that are actually happening behind the scenes in this world, invisible realities, which are actually the forces controlling and at play in the world."}
{"source": "And that means you have to pay attention to the rest of the book of revelation."}
{"source": "And a lot of times that means you have to pay attention to the rest of the Bible and especially the old Testament, because so many of these wild, bizarre images in revelation, John is seeing things that are just being borrowed from and picked up from Genesis."}
{"source": "In revelation chapter four, the chapter before ours this morning, John, the apostle, the beloved friend of Jesus sees he's transported by a vision and the Holy Spirit."}
{"source": "So look at chapter four, verse one, John says, after this, I looked and behold, a door standing open in heaven."}
{"source": "And so John walks in or up by the spirit and realizes as he surveys the scene that he's inside of a throne room."}
{"source": "So in the outermost circle, there are 24 elders, John says."}
{"source": "So John in his letter speaks of the 12 tribes of Israel."}
{"source": "Now there are John sees four living creatures."}
{"source": "The four living creatures here are clearly angels and seem very closely related to other creatures who we meet earlier in the Bible, in places like Ezekiel or even a famous scene like Isaiah chapter six."}
{"source": "Before the four living creatures, still closer now to the center, John sees a vast expanse."}
{"source": "John describes it in chapter four, verse six, as a sea of glass like crystal."}
{"source": "And then at the very center in the innermost part of this room, John sees a throne where God himself is seated and from where God rules the world."}
{"source": "John walks through this open door and he finds in this room a worship service is happening."}
{"source": "In fact, what John sees there is very much like what we're doing now."}
{"source": "In chapter five, our chapter this morning, John is still inside this throne room, which he entered in chapter four, still watching this worship service unfold."}
{"source": "Three things John sees."}
{"source": "I saw third, John says, a choir."}
{"source": "John's eyes, and you can understand why, his eyes first, I mean, think about all the options here and all the things he sees."}
{"source": "John doesn't give much detail on the throne here in chapter five, but back in chapter four, he did his best to describe it."}
{"source": "If you want to look back one chapter, John says, and he who sat there on that throne had the appearance of Jasper and Carnelian."}
{"source": "So John says, John sees the throne."}
{"source": "Now, back in chapter five, John zeroes in on the right hand of him who is seated upon that throne at the center of the room."}
{"source": "Your right hand, O Lord, shatters the enemy, Moses saying in Exodus 15, 6."}
{"source": "John sees in the right hand of him who is seated upon this throne, he sees a scroll."}
{"source": "And we want to really pay attention to the details of the scroll, because this is the first thing John sees and pauses on."}
{"source": "Notice John sees further in verse one, this scroll was sealed with seven seals."}
{"source": "Now, a brief word about numbers in Revelation."}
{"source": "People go bananas with numbers in Revelation and sometimes in very unhelpful ways."}
{"source": "But I want to point out a couple of things here which will be relevant throughout this sermon and throughout this scene in John's Revelation."}
{"source": "Numbers are highly symbolic in Revelation."}
{"source": "That's a misunderstanding of the nature of symbols in Revelation."}
{"source": "Numbers are symbolic, but they're, again, they're loaded with meaning supplied by the rest of the book and supplied often by the rest of the Bible."}
{"source": "John wants you to know their meaning."}
{"source": "A few numbers in particular are really important and repeated throughout the book constantly, and none more so than the number seven and four."}
{"source": "From Genesis actually on, you remember God created the earth and designed everything in six days, and on the seventh day he rested."}
{"source": "And that number takes on a symbolic nature and reverberates throughout the rest of the Bible, even to the very last book in John."}
{"source": "Four, on the other hand, in Revelation, clearly represents the entire earth."}
{"source": "Revelation chapter 7 verse 1 and Revelation chapter 20 verse 8, where four represents north, south, east, west, the four, all the earth."}
{"source": "Well, John doesn't outright tell us here in the chapter the contents of the scroll, but I think if you as you read his book, it actually becomes pretty clear what this scroll is."}
{"source": "In chapter four, verse one, John is invited up into the throne room to see, he says, things to come."}
{"source": "In Daniel chapter seven in the Old Testament, which is very much a parallel to this passage this morning."}
{"source": "This is revelation, baby."}
{"source": "This book in revelation is to unleash its contents."}
{"source": "If that, if I could say that in a different way, if this book that John's, if this scroll is not open, then all the things in the book do not come true."}
{"source": "But remember, John, John's just trying to keep up with the dizzying lights and sounds that he's seeing and which he barely knows how to describe."}
{"source": "Not even in heaven, John says in verse three, not even from heaven."}
{"source": "John, upon hearing and realizing the silence is look at verse four, he's overcome by horror and he just starts uncontrollably weeping loudly."}
{"source": "I'd like to know what's in the scroll, but what's going on, John?"}
{"source": "John's not weeping here because he's emotionally unhinged."}
{"source": "John's weeping because he's the only sane one of us who has understood what it means for this book to remain shut."}
{"source": "And with these words, writes one author, John sets the scene for one of the greatest moments in all of known literature."}
{"source": "Because at that moment, in John's despair, a voice calls out from the throne room."}
{"source": "Two of the towering images throughout the Old Testament for the Messiah, that's the one promised all the way back beginning in Genesis three, the one who would come from the seat of the woman and crush the head of the serpent and deal with evil and deal with sin and make everything right and new again."}
{"source": "Two of the twin towering images of that one to come promises from Genesis three on our first, the lion of Judah."}
{"source": "That comes first in Genesis 49, where we read Judah is a lion's cub from the prey."}
{"source": "This is from Isaiah 11, which was read for us earlier in the service where we read there shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse."}
{"source": "This one will judge with righteousness after he judges when he gains the throne."}
{"source": "You remember earlier in Revelation chapter two and three, John had given them."}
{"source": "Revelation's message to the church is you must conquer."}
{"source": "And the elders announcement to John here weep no more."}
{"source": "In that moment, John."}
{"source": "And so John turns and he looks into that sacred space in the very center."}
{"source": "Who is somehow without John noticing it made it past the four living creatures."}
{"source": "The second thing John sees in our passage and stares at inviting us to stare out with him."}
{"source": "Throughout revelation, there's this fascinating pattern where John."}
{"source": "It can almost feel contradictory, but it's actually how revelation gets its message across."}
{"source": "John hears something, a message and what he sees describes and defines further than it interprets what he hears for him."}
{"source": "Here, John hears of a lion notice."}
{"source": "And turning to look, John sees a lamb."}
{"source": "Is the suffering servant of Isaiah."}
{"source": "The lamb is standing, John says, as though it had been slain."}
{"source": "The lamb also has, we read John sees seven eyes, eyes represent throughout the Bible, wisdom and knowledge."}
{"source": "Paul says in first Corinthians one 24."}
{"source": "Now John's eyes fixed upon the spectacle of the slain lamb."}
{"source": "Watch this in a direction, neither John nor the angels, nor the 24 elders, nor the living creatures, nor anybody else in all the universe has ever seen anybody move."}
{"source": "Hebrews eight, five says, this is the real thing."}
{"source": "Just try to put yourself in poor John's shoes, crying, weeping, loudly dizzy, hopeful, confused, terrified more than anything else."}
{"source": "And then John hears a loud bang upon the surface, echoing throughout the entire room as bodies all in once hit the floor, not the lambs, the four living creatures, the 24 elders, everybody in the room, everybody else outside of the throne at the center falls to the floor bowing before the lamb and the mighty warrior cherubim unpassed by any mere mortal."}
{"source": "Think about the Exodus."}
{"source": "John says, and I heard around the throne and the living creatures and the elders, the voices of many angels, numbering myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice, worthy is the lamb who was slain to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing worthy as the lamb."}
{"source": "Let us then with confidence approach the throne of grace, Hebrews 4 says."}
{"source": "The point of the entire book of revelation is that God is controlling history, turning it here and there and ruling behind the scenes, though it often doesn't look like it always doing so to accomplish his purposes."}
{"source": "Revelation was written, not to give you a map and a timeline to go crazy with."}
{"source": "Revelation is saying, let me show you more."}
{"source": "And I want to tell you all of you, one final thing about the book of revelation."}
{"source": "And one more thing about those numbers."}
{"source": "The word Christ, Christ is used seven times in revelation."}
{"source": "The phrase, the testimony of Jesus is used seven times in revelation."}
{"source": "Just Jesus is used seven other times in revelation."}
{"source": "John writes the word lamb 28, seven times four, seven is the number of completion."}
{"source": "One author quote readers of this passage who themselves fail to join in with this heavenly host are listening to the text only with their brains and not with the exhilaration intended by John so that his readers are themselves drawn into the heavenly scene as part of the heavenly worship."}
{"source": "Mae Diwd yn cyflwyno'i hunain fel gweithgareddwyr i Jesus Christus a brwydr i James."}
{"source": "Nawr, mae hyn yn ddiddorol iawn, oherwydd yw James Mary a Joseph's son, y brwydr i Jesus."}
{"source": "Ond pan edrychodd Jude ar ei bwrwyr, roedd e'n gweld rhywun yn unig, glorius, ddiffin."}
{"source": "Nawr, nid yw Jude bob amser wedi gweld Jesus yn y ffordd hon."}
{"source": "Felly, yn John 7, 5, rydym yn cael ei ddweud nad oedd eich brwyrwyr Jesus hefyd yn credu iddyn nhw."}
{"source": "Ac mae'r dyfodol hwn, mae Jude'n ei ddweud, yn cael ei hysbysu."}
{"source": "Mae'r ymdrechion Paul, Peter a John yn ymwneud \u00e2 hyrwyddoedd yn y ysgafn."}
{"source": "Look again at verse 4, Jude calls them ungodly people who pervert the grace of our God into sensuality and deny our only Master and Lord Jesus Christ."}
{"source": "So in verse 12, Jude refers to them as shepherds feeding themselves."}
{"source": "However, Jude reminds us that these people haven't surprised God."}
{"source": "In verses 5 to 16, Jude is going to further describe the ungodliness of these intruders."}
{"source": "Hopefully, this is helpful to see the pattern Jude uses."}
{"source": "Jude is going to list three Old Testament examples."}
{"source": "And what Jude is doing is this."}
{"source": "But no, Jude is blowing that thinking out of the water."}
{"source": "Jude mentions the angels who did not stay within their own position of authority, but left their proper dwelling."}
{"source": "It's difficult to know exactly what event Jude is referring to here."}
{"source": "Others think it's that bizarre event in Genesis chapter 6."}
{"source": "Jude recalls God's judgment against Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities."}
{"source": "Now, if you look at verse 8, we see how Jude links the ungodly of the past with the ungodly of the present."}
{"source": "Jude is convinced that the same unbelieving, authority-rejecting, lustful ungodliness has infiltrated the church."}
{"source": "It's difficult to know exactly what Jude means here."}
{"source": "That may explain Jude's words in verse 9 there."}
{"source": "Well, Jude recounts a story there about the archangel Michael disputing with Satan over Moses' body."}
{"source": "It was a story Jude's readers would have likely been familiar with."}
{"source": "So Jude uses it to illustrate his point."}
{"source": "Lewis' The Screwtape Letters or John Milton's Paradise Lost."}
{"source": "Jude simply uses it as an illustration."}
{"source": "See how Jude is using the past to warn us about the future?"}
{"source": "However, Jude switches the order a little bit here."}
{"source": "In Genesis 4, God warned Cain that sin was crouching at his door."}
{"source": "In verses 12 to 13, Jude applies all this to the intruders."}
{"source": "These godless people are participating in something Jude calls the love feasts."}
{"source": "Jude calls them shepherds feeding themselves."}
{"source": "They're like the bad shepherds of Ezekiel 34, living for themselves at the expense of God."}
{"source": "Jude says that ungodly people only lead others astray to the utter darkness of hell."}
{"source": "This brings us to Jude's second extra biblical reference in verses 14 to 15."}
{"source": "Jude lists some examples of ungodliness in verse 16."}
{"source": "But I think Jude does want us to be alert."}
{"source": "Jude keeps pointing us back to the Old Testament and saying, look what happens to the ungodly."}
{"source": "Remember Jude, he's using the past to warn us about the future so that we might contend for the faith in the present."}
{"source": "I mean, this is probably being a difficult sermon to hear because Jude is very clear about what will happen to the ungodly."}
{"source": "And I think there are two bad ways you could respond to Jude."}
{"source": "If so, let Jude remind you, although you once fully knew it, that God will destroy the ungodly."}
{"source": "Christian, remember what Jude said?"}
{"source": "Would you use these warnings in Jude as a means to that end, Lord?"}
{"source": "John Adams was hardly a British sympathizer, but he mounted a vigorous defense of these soldiers and actually won before a hostile jury of American colonists."}
{"source": "Well, our passage for this morning from John's first letter, we will see that while you may never find yourself in a court of law accused of a crime, there will stand a time when you will find yourself in need of the help of someone who can mount an adequate defense for you."}
{"source": "So if you would please turn in your Bibles to 1 John chapter 2."}
{"source": "So 1 John chapter 2."}
{"source": "John starts by saying, my little children, I am writing these things to you, so that you may not sin."}
{"source": "You see at the outset, the Apostle John has an affectionate relationship with his readers in the church."}
{"source": "John is most likely quite old at the time that he's writing."}
{"source": "If you remember in chapter 1, it seems like John was really focused in on his opponents, on these false teachers that had fractured the church."}
{"source": "And here John tells them the purpose of his writing to them."}
{"source": "And so it seems here when we get to chapter 2, verse 1, that John is concerned that we don't take those things that he's just written and misunderstand them, right?"}
{"source": "There's a twisted way of reading John's words there at the end of chapter 1 and deciding, well, okay, I guess it's fine to sin."}
{"source": "After all, John says right there, no one can claim to not have sin."}
{"source": "This weekend I had a road trip and had Captain Joshua Louder along with me."}
{"source": "If I get pulled over, I'm sure Joshua knows the guy, right?"}
{"source": "You could imagine if you had a card or if you had Joshua with you, that might make you less than vigilant about minding the speed limit."}
{"source": "But John here doesn't want us to use God's grace, his forgiveness, as an excuse to be lax about sin."}
{"source": "This is really a foundational idea, one that John is going to come to over and over and over again in his letter."}
{"source": "First John is a bit different than a lot of other letters in that oftentimes, especially if you're reading Paul, he starts at the beginning and he makes a sort of a linear argument that builds and flows."}
{"source": "John, if you read first John, he kind of circles around, he kind of keeps coming back to different ideas throughout the letter."}
{"source": "So we're going to see this idea repeated throughout first John, that the mercy and the cleansing love and forgiveness of God, it was never intended to make us less concerned about personal holiness."}
{"source": "You don't come to church expecting to hear that sin is no big deal, but, but why is it exactly that John doesn't want us to just relax and stop worrying about sin and just enjoy God's forgiveness and even, even celebrate it by sinning all that we want."}
{"source": "Well, John gives us the reason in the rest of our passage."}
{"source": "If we keep his commandments, John's talking here about knowing."}
{"source": "John wants us to know that we know God."}
{"source": "To know God is in John's words, to have fellowship with him there in chapter one, verse three, to know God is to, is to walk with him, to delight in him, to love him, to experience his grace in your life."}
{"source": "John says, we can know God like that."}
{"source": "John isn't saying that our obedience to God's commands creates a relationship with him."}
{"source": "What John is saying here is if we truly keep his law, right?"}
{"source": "If we, if we obey his commands, which Jesus defined as a, as an obedience that springs from our hearts, from our love for God, John saying that is convincing evidence that we know him."}
{"source": "That's why there in verse six, John says that if we abide in Christ, that is to say, if we are connected to him spiritually, we're going to walk, right?"}
{"source": "What John is calling us to in this chapter is not random obedience to arbitrary commands."}
{"source": "So you see the point John's making there in verse three, if we know God, we will keep his commands because those commands are part of what God's doing in our lives."}
{"source": "As we'll see over and over again in first John, the salvation that God gives us in Christ, it's not something sort of inert and lifeless put on a shelf, but it transforms everything about how we live."}
{"source": "So much so that John can say there in verse five, that God's love is perfected."}
{"source": "John's writing here so that we will not sin so that we will respond to God's love and grace and forgiveness and mercy with obedience."}
{"source": "What John is saying here first, I think it's obvious that we need to look and see if our lives give evidence that we know God."}
{"source": "John says, I'm writing these things to you that you may not sin."}
{"source": "The second thing I think for us to see here is what John says in verse four."}
{"source": "It's likely that here, John is taking a shot at the false teachers who had gone out from the church."}
{"source": "But John is pointing out that their lives don't appear to support that claim."}
{"source": "But if they don't care to keep God's commands, John says they are liars."}
{"source": "And no matter how eloquent and how convincing they are, John says the truth is not in them."}
{"source": "John says if their life doesn't match up, then they don't know God."}
{"source": "Because we, like John's original audience, need to be careful which voices we're listening to."}
{"source": "According to John, the truth just isn't in a person like that."}
{"source": "If anyone says they know God but doesn't have any concern to keep his commands, John says they're a liar."}
{"source": "John says, but if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the father, Jesus Christ, the righteous."}
{"source": "Again, as we go through 1 John, we're going to keep feeling this tension."}
{"source": "John expects that the Christian life will be characterized by significant obedience to the commands of God, significant growth in holiness, but he also understands that sin is going to be an ongoing struggle for the believer and that God has made a provision for us in Christ."}
{"source": "John has no problem holding those two truths in tension and so we're going to have to do that as we go through."}
{"source": "We find ourselves at times doing the very things that we hate, and so if the only thing that John had to tell us was don't sin, well, then we'd be lost or we'd have only two choices."}
{"source": "We could just give up altogether, right, because who can do that and just give our lives over to sin and immorality because no one can keep that standard, John."}
{"source": "Okay, John, too late."}
{"source": "I can do all those things, John, all right."}
{"source": "John says, if anyone sins, so that's you, that's me, he says, we have an advocate."}
{"source": "The Greek word that John uses there is paraclete."}
{"source": "Three times in John's gospel, Jesus actually calls the Holy Spirit that he's sending a paraclete."}
{"source": "So John here is framing our sin in forensic terms."}
{"source": "And so you see how wonderful it is, how amazing the news is when John says there, you have an advocate."}
{"source": "John calls him Jesus Christ."}
{"source": "John is reminding us that Jesus is the anointed king sent by God to redeem his people from their sins."}
{"source": "The word that John uses there is one he uses four other places in this short letter."}
{"source": "John mentions in verse 6 the way he walked."}
{"source": "We have an advocate, John says, with the father."}
{"source": "John is saying here that sinners are not left to face justice without any help or any assistance."}
{"source": "If the judge is God the Father himself, as John indicates there in verse 1, Jesus is our advocate before the Father, so if the Father himself is our judge, if the case against us gets stronger every day with every sinful thought and attitude and deed, we're not getting off on a technicality here."}
{"source": "But look at what John says there in verse 2."}
{"source": "John tells us that he's also the propitiation for our sins."}
{"source": "Here John's shifting the image a little bit."}
{"source": "In the original Greek that John's writing in, there in verse 2, John uses a word that emphasizes the fact that Jesus himself is our propitiation."}
{"source": "John doesn't say right here in these verses, but he's already told us."}
{"source": "Back in 1 John 1, verse 7, we read there, the blood of Jesus, his son, cleanses us from all sin."}
{"source": "The apostle Paul tells us in Romans 3.25 that God the Father put Jesus forward as a propitiation, he says, by his blood."}
{"source": "So brothers and sisters, as we conclude, as we approach the Lord's table together, let me briefly point out just three things that we should notice about what John's saying here."}
{"source": "First, what John says here is the only way that God can be both just and merciful."}
{"source": "John 3.16, what does it tell us?"}
{"source": "A bit later on in this letter, in 1 John chapter 4, we read this, in this is love."}
{"source": "No, this truth, what John shows us here, ought to change everything about your life."}
{"source": "John says there in verse 2 that Jesus is our propitiation, not only for the sins of his original readers, he says, but for the sins of the whole world."}
{"source": "Now, I think it's clear that John doesn't mean to say that the sin of every person in the world has been paid for by the death of Jesus."}
{"source": "And even in this letter in 1 John 5, John makes it very clear no one has eternal life unless they have Jesus."}
{"source": "Instead, what John seems to be pointing us to here is that Jesus' death, the propitiation that he made, was meant for people all over the world."}
{"source": "And for those of us who are already followers of Christ, then John's words here mean that you have an advocate."}
{"source": "Do you read verse one where John says, I'm writing these things so that you won't sin and all you think is I've messed up again."}
{"source": "Yes, John is writing so that you and I will not sin."}
{"source": "Sermon passage for this morning out of First Thessalonians chapter 5 verses 1 through 11 can be found on page 987 in the Bible in front of you."}
{"source": "Well, this is the book of Acts, right?"}
{"source": "Think 1 Peter 2."}
{"source": "You know, John Bunyan, author of Pilgrim's Progress, has a great scene in that classic work."}
{"source": "Your job is not to drum up faith."}
{"source": "Your job is very simply to look to Christ."}
{"source": "Scripture reading is 2 Corinthians chapter 4, 1 through 6 on page 965."}
{"source": "I'm also clear about what my job is, which is to do what's best for the restaurant, not to do what's best for any of you."}
{"source": "And so as we've been reading through 2 Corinthians, we've been seeing that Paul wants to make his case to defend the legitimacy of his ministry among them, to explain why he doesn't do things in a way that might seem right to them."}
{"source": "And if you remember, Paul pointed back in chapter 3 to the book of Exodus, where Moses would meet face to face with God, and as a result, his face would shine for a while."}
{"source": "So when we come to second Corinthians chapter four, we see the apostle Paul is making his operating principles clear."}
{"source": "And so let's turn there and see what the apostle says here in the first few verses of of chapter four of second Corinthians."}
{"source": "So if you remember last week, we left off at the end of chapter three in second Corinthians 318."}
{"source": "Or if you remember in Luke chapter two, when the angel of the Lord appears to the shepherds to announce Jesus's birth, we read there that the glory of the Lord shown around them."}
{"source": "And at the end of the Bible in Revelation 2123, we see that in the heavenly city there, there is we're told no need for sun or moon, because the glory of God will serve as light for the people there."}
{"source": "That's what the apostle Paul means when he talks about the gospel here in Second Corinthians, chapter four."}
{"source": "So, for example, in Psalm 43, the psalmist asks the Lord to send out your light and your truth."}
{"source": "In Psalm 119, the psalmist says the unfolding of your words gives light."}
{"source": "So Paul's grabbing on to that sort of Old Testament context and language, and he's saying that there is a light that emanates from the gospel message and that light is the revelation of truth concerning the righteousness and salvation of God."}
{"source": "In Psalm 82, we read a condemnation of the rulers of Israel who wouldn't protect the poor and the vulnerable."}
{"source": "So in John chapter three, we read this."}
{"source": "But there in verse two of Second Corinthians four, Paul Paul describes his declaration of the gospel as an open statement of the truth."}
{"source": "So we read in the prophet Isaiah that he would he saw a day when we be when we would be able to say the people who walked in darkness have seen a great light."}
{"source": "So in Colossians, Paul writes this about Jesus."}
{"source": "In Philippians, he speaks of Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count a quality with God, a thing to be grasped."}
{"source": "Paul goes on to say the author of Hebrews adds this."}
{"source": "So the picture that Paul connects to here in second Corinthians for that we see throughout the New Testament is that Jesus is utterly glorious."}
{"source": "In Acts chapter 26, Paul describes this encounter with Jesus, this call to ministry."}
{"source": "Do you hear echoes of our passage from Second Corinthians four in Paul's rehearsal of of what Jesus said to him?"}
{"source": "All of those themes from Jesus's words to Paul and his conversion make their way into Second Corinthians four."}
{"source": "One of Paul's chief reasons for writing Second Corinthians is to commend himself and his team to this church."}
{"source": "He doesn't even say, I came and I did acts of mercy and kindness."}
{"source": "As he says in Romans 10, faith comes through hearing."}
{"source": "We saw that back in first Corinthians."}
{"source": "Paul's operating principle, the thing by which he judges everything else is what is good for the gospel."}
{"source": "And in 2 Corinthians 3.16, Paul says that when someone turns to Christ, that veil is removed."}
{"source": "Remember when Jesus commissioned him in Acts 26, he told Agrippa, he said his job was to go and to open their eyes, that they might turn from darkness to light."}
{"source": "And what we're going to see in our passage today from the Old Testament book of Leviticus is that this idea, salvation by substitution, that the Lord Jesus would stand in our place and take our punishment on himself at the cross, that's not a new development that we only see once we get to the New Testament."}
{"source": "What I want to do is step back for a second and put Leviticus 16 in the larger context of the Pentateuch."}
{"source": "So Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy."}
{"source": "What I want to do is take Leviticus 16 and step back for a second and try to understand it in the context of the entire Pentateuch because I think there are some literary features of the way these first five books of the Bible are put together that are meant to point us to just how important this Day of Atonement really is to the storyline."}
{"source": "The prophets and the psalmists, the authors of Proverbs and the inscrutable book of Ecclesiastes that Mike is going to unpack for the youth, they all used the form of their writing to help communicate the meaning."}
{"source": "When we come to Leviticus 16, I think we see that Moses has presented this material to us in a chiastic structure."}
{"source": "Or take the words of the Lord Jesus in Mark 2, verse 27."}
{"source": "If you look at the first five books of the Bible, you can see that Genesis, we'll call it A, presents us with certain themes."}
{"source": "Then you move on to Exodus."}
{"source": "Leviticus, which we've been considering, presents us with sacrifices in the tabernacle, right?"}
{"source": "Numbers echoes many of the same themes as Exodus."}
{"source": "Deuteronomy presents us with many of the same themes as Genesis."}
{"source": "Leviticus is."}
{"source": "So if Leviticus is the center of the first five books of the Bible, there's a chapter that's really at the heart of the book of Leviticus."}
{"source": "And to spoil the surprise, it's Leviticus 16."}
{"source": "So Leviticus itself is set up like a chiasm within a chiasm."}
{"source": "Leviticus 1-7 gives us laws about sacrifice and sanctuary."}
{"source": "So again, you have this chiastic structure, even within the book of Leviticus."}
{"source": "The sort of highlight of the Pentateuch is Leviticus."}
{"source": "The very highlight of Leviticus is chapter 16."}
{"source": "So the Pentateuch centers on the book of Leviticus."}
{"source": "The book of Leviticus centers on chapter 16."}
{"source": "So I think what we're meant to see is that the whole of the first five books, the books of Moses, center on Leviticus."}
{"source": "And all of Leviticus is pointing us to chapter 16."}
{"source": "And that's the ritual that we see being laid out for us here in Leviticus 16."}
{"source": "That fits in perfectly with what we've seen so far in the book of Leviticus."}
{"source": "That's why we read in Genesis 3.24 that cherubim with flaming swords were posted at the entrance to the Garden to keep them from coming back."}
{"source": "Sin has the sense of falling short and missing the mark."}
{"source": "So what do we learn then from Leviticus 16?"}
{"source": "So friends, what we see here at the high point of the Pentateuch, at the high point of the book of Leviticus, at the high point of chapter 16, is that salvation through substitution is God's gracious and loving provision of atonement."}
{"source": "It turns out as God's redemption unfolded, Leviticus 16, the day of atonement ritual, it was meant to prepare God's people for the work of the Lord Jesus."}
{"source": "The rituals of Leviticus 16 were brought to completion."}
{"source": "That's exactly what the author of Hebrews is saying in Hebrews chapters 9-10."}
{"source": "Let me just briefly point out to you three ways that Jesus fulfills and supersedes and explodes the things that we read about here in Leviticus 16."}
{"source": "There are many more than three, but you can unpack these at greater length by reading the book of Hebrews."}
{"source": "But the goal here, I think the reason why we as Christians want to be familiar with Leviticus 16 is so that the work of the Lord Jesus and his person and his love would be more precious to us."}
{"source": "The whole ceremony here in Leviticus rides on the work of the High Priest."}
{"source": "But what we see in Leviticus 16 is that Aaron doesn't actually belong there."}
{"source": "We read in Hebrews chapter 7, verse 27, speaking of Jesus, he has no need like those high priests to offer sacrifices daily, first for his own sin and then for those of the people, since he did this once for all when he offered himself up."}
{"source": "And so Hebrews tells us why this day of atonement ritual in Leviticus 16 could never be a permanent solution."}
{"source": "It says in Hebrews 10 verse 4, it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins."}
{"source": "In verse 11 of Hebrews 10, every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifices which can never take away sins."}
{"source": "We see in Leviticus 16 that Aaron had to go through a lot just to go into the Holy of Holies."}
{"source": "But friends, when Jesus died, the veil in the temple, that curtain that kept human beings away from the presence of God for their own safety, we read in Matthew 27, verse 51, it was torn in two."}
{"source": "Again, the book of Hebrews, chapter 10, verse 19."}
{"source": "Leviticus 16 verse 34 reminds the people that this is a permanent statute, that the people of Israel would need this ritual of atonement through substitution every year."}
{"source": "Can you see that if you were an Israelite in the time of Moses when Leviticus 16 is being written, the day of atonement would be the very best thing you could imagine."}
{"source": "The second thing I think we need to see in this chapter, Leviticus 16, is that it ought to cause us to despair of any other way of being right with God."}
{"source": "If God has provided salvation through substitution in the death of his son, consistent with the pattern laid out for us in Leviticus 16, what other way of salvation could there possibly be?"}
{"source": "We read the little story in Luke 18, starting in verse 10, Jesus says this, two men went into the temple to pray."}
{"source": "The Greek word that the tax collector uses for mercy, it's that same word that would have been used to translate the idea of the mercy seat, or the atonement cover, in Leviticus 16."}
{"source": "Leviticus 16 shows us that God has appointed a way for your sins to be dealt with."}
{"source": "Anybody here heard a sermon on the book of Habakkuk before?"}
{"source": "Habakkuk, page 785, towards the back of your Old Testament."}
{"source": "I bring this up because now and then in another few weeks, we're going to take a couple of breaks from 2 Corinthians to spend some time in a few minor prophets."}
{"source": "And this is why we find ourselves in the book of Habakkuk this morning."}
{"source": "So you have major prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, books like that."}
{"source": "Instead, in the book of Habakkuk, what we get are three chapters of one man's personal wrestling with the Lord."}
{"source": "Now, crucially, what changes in the book of Habakkuk is not Habakkuk's circumstances."}
{"source": "So what changes in the book of Habakkuk?"}
{"source": "I think we see this in the two prayers that bookend this book of Habakkuk."}
{"source": "So Habakkuk begins with this book with a troubled, panicked, unnerved prophet."}
{"source": "Listen to this first prayer in the book of Habakkuk."}
{"source": "Verse one says, the oracle that Habakkuk the prophet saw."}
{"source": "How would you describe the man Habakkuk here?"}
{"source": "Chapter three, Habakkuk's final prayer, and just notice if anything's changed."}
{"source": "The prophet Habakkuk, he moves from praying in a great panic to praying with great peace."}
{"source": "How did it happen with Habakkuk?"}
{"source": "In the beginning of the book, Habakkuk prays only according to what he sees in the world."}
{"source": "In other words, in three short chapters, we see Habakkuk move from living by sight to living according to the power that the Lord has given him."}
{"source": "The Lord, in his kindness, has given us a short, relatable, prophetic book in which Habakkuk prays these same prayers to this same God from this same fallen world."}
{"source": "And it's a book in which the Lord answers him with one amazing, life-altering truth, a truth that is the same for us as it was for Habakkuk."}
{"source": "Habakkuk's first prayer, it's honest and relatable, isn't it?"}
{"source": "But notice Habakkuk's prayers in these first chapters, they're consumed by, they're filled with the things that he can see."}
{"source": "Habakkuk is praying and he says, Lord, everywhere I turn my eyes, I see a new terrible reality."}
{"source": "Habakkuk looks out at the world as it is in all its fallenness and quite simply, he's a man who's overwhelmed."}
{"source": "And I'm sure that you've done as Habakkuk has, like a Christian is supposed to do."}
{"source": "You've turned these mornings, you've turned these lamentations into prayers."}
{"source": "This is what Habakkuk felt."}
{"source": "So you can tell what Habakkuk is feeling as he prays."}
{"source": "It's at this point in the book that the Lord himself speaks up and he speaks up to inform Habakkuk that contrary to what he can see, the Lord is actually doing."}
{"source": "So here it's as if the Lord kind of looks at Habakkuk and he says, all right, man, you want to live and pray and relate to me based on what you can see?"}
{"source": "But that's not the work the Lord has in mind here in Habakkuk."}
{"source": "So here Habakkuk wants to see more of what exactly the Lord is doing."}
{"source": "So the Lord, the Lord shows him and you know what Habakkuk sees?"}
{"source": "That's this work that he's doing that Habakkuk wanted to see."}
{"source": "The prophets, you know, all throughout the prophets, they use this poetic language to paint pictures for us and the picture that God shows Habakkuk about what God is doing is not comforting to Habakkuk to say the least."}
{"source": "And Habakkuk sees it, and once again, he's confounded."}
{"source": "As he prays and as he laments, is Habakkuk wrong in the way that he's conceiving God?"}
{"source": "And is Habakkuk wrong in the way that he's praying?"}
{"source": "So this is the tension in the book of Habakkuk."}
{"source": "Habakkuk has no problem with a high view of God."}
{"source": "No, what Habakkuk is having trouble with is reconciling this high view of God with the fact that this amazing God is allowing, even orchestrating, these devastatingly difficult things for his people."}
{"source": "Habakkuk was certainly there and having kind of lodged the second protest, the prophet positions himself for God's reply."}
{"source": "Here at the beginning of chapter two, Habakkuk is still insistent on seeing, isn't he?"}
{"source": "Habakkuk is still desirous for God to show him exactly what's going on."}
{"source": "So Habakkuk is praying."}
{"source": "And it's at this point that the Lord answers a second time and he's inviting Habakkuk and us into a different, a deeper, and quite honestly, a more difficult way to pray."}
{"source": "Habakkuk 2 verse 2, And the Lord answered me, write the vision, make it plain on tablets so that he may run who reads it."}
{"source": "So here in chapter two, interestingly, the Lord doesn't deny Habakkuk a vision, but notice the vision is capturing things to happen when, not now, but sometime in the future."}
{"source": "So you can see there in verse three, he assures Habakkuk there is a plan, a plan that he will eventually see come to fruition, but that plan has a specific determined appointed time."}
{"source": "And the Lord is making it clear all throughout this book that the determiner of that good timing is not Habakkuk, it's the Lord."}
{"source": "So your role, Habakkuk, and your role, Christian, you should hear this, we should hear this, your role is not to make God's plans for him."}
{"source": "This is the application for Habakkuk, the application for Israel, the application for the church, the application for you."}
{"source": "So in the context of Habakkuk, the example that God gives of this puffed up soul is the wicked nation that he's using as an instrument of justice here, right?"}
{"source": "So again, that's why here in God's providence, in Habakkuk, this foreign nation is held up not only as God's instrument of judgment, but at the same time, the recipient of judgment because of the wicked, the faithless way in which they live."}
{"source": "And here in the second half of the book of Habakkuk, we'll take this more quickly, the Lord reminds him, the Lord reminds us of two very precious promises by which you must live as a Christian."}
{"source": "Remember Habakkuk's overarching concern in chapter one, as he looked out over the horrific conditions and fallenness of the world, his concern was what, back in chapter one?"}
{"source": "The point, Habakkuk, church, people who long for justice in the world, but see none."}
{"source": "Here we have one final prayer of Habakkuk."}
{"source": "It's a psalm, really, you see that?"}
{"source": "It's almost like it's this psalm that's been tacked on to the end of this book, playing a very specific purpose, a prayer of Habakkuk, the prophet, according to Shigienoth."}
{"source": "It's in this psalm, chapter three of Habakkuk, where we see that he's come full circle in his way of living and praying."}
{"source": "You see, Habakkuk has made this term in the book."}
{"source": "In chapter one, what Habakkuk saw was an evil army marching through the world to bring destruction on God's people."}
{"source": "But here in chapter three, what Habakkuk hears is a different march."}
{"source": "Notice how this picture harkens back to the work of God in salvation that he's already done, particularly in the exodus of his people."}
{"source": "Habakkuk hears of his coming."}
{"source": "Have the overwhelming things that Habakkuk saw in the world, have they gone away?"}
{"source": "What we see in Habakkuk and all over the Bible is that the wickedness of the world, listen, it may be new to you."}
{"source": "He is now leading a new march, a new exodus out of the domain of darkness into the kingdom of light."}
{"source": "Habakkuk once prayed what?"}
{"source": "In a fallen world, it could take Habakkuk's health, it could take his money, it could take his property, it could take his provision, it could take his vocation, but it could not touch his salvation."}
{"source": "Well, in our passage for this morning from the New Testament letter of 1 John, we're going to see that the author of this letter tells the church that he has the most extraordinary access."}
{"source": "And John says that he loves nothing more."}
{"source": "So this is the first in what Lord willing will be a series of sermons in the New Testament letter of 1 John."}
{"source": "We call it 1 John because there are two other letters in the New Testament by the same author."}
{"source": "We've creatively named those 2 John and 3 John."}
{"source": "We call it 1 John because it's pretty well established that the author of this letter is the Apostle John."}
{"source": "Now you might notice as you go through the book, much like the book of Hebrews, the author doesn't actually identify himself."}
{"source": "But there is good reason to conclude that the Apostle John, one of Jesus's inner circle, one of his twelve disciples, the author of the Gospel of John, there's good reason to conclude that he's also the author of 1 and 2 and 3 John."}
{"source": "So let me give you three reasons why we believe John is the author of this book."}
{"source": "And in their writings and in their teachings, they assume that John wrote these letters."}
{"source": "The second reason we think that John wrote this letter is because the author tells us, as we're going to see in our passage for this morning, that he was an intimate eyewitness of Jesus's earthly life and ministry."}
{"source": "But John would certainly fit."}
{"source": "And then finally, I think most convincingly, the author's style of writing, his subject choice, his choice of vocabulary and syntax, it is very similar to the Gospel of John."}
{"source": "So much so that if John didn't write this, someone was clearly copying his style."}
{"source": "So as you go through this book, if you're studying certain words and where they appear at other times in the New Testament, almost always, if there's a sort of a unique word in 1 John, the other place it appears in the New Testament will be in John's Gospel."}
{"source": "So we're going to go forward in this series with the assumption that John the Apostle is the author."}
{"source": "Now I've been calling it a book, but it's a bit difficult to actually pin down the exact genre or form of 1 John."}
{"source": "So if you remember, we've just finished studying 1 Thessalonians."}
{"source": "Seth and Mike did a great job taking us through there."}
{"source": "It's most likely that this was written after John wrote his Gospel."}
{"source": "It seems, as we go along, we'll see, it seems that 1 John was written in part to correct some ways that his Gospel was being misunderstood and misapplied."}
{"source": "And so we normally date the composition of John's Gospel around 80 to 85 AD."}
{"source": "We have letters from the early church quoting 1 John as early as about 100 AD."}
{"source": "So that gives us a window from maybe 85 AD to 100 AD for 1 John to be written."}
{"source": "This would make John an elderly man."}
{"source": "Now, in terms of why John wrote, it seems that false teaching had infiltrated the church."}
{"source": "In chapter 2 verse 26, John talks about those who are trying to deceive you."}
{"source": "So it does seem that there was false teaching gaining a foothold in these congregations and that there had been some crisis that had involved an exodus of people who followed these false teachers."}
{"source": "So when we talk about mirror reading, we mean looking at the text of a letter, something like 1 John or 1 Corinthians or Ephesians, and kind of recreating the situation on the ground based on what we see there."}
{"source": "So for example, in 1 John, we see the Apostle hammers over and over on certain points of doctrine."}
{"source": "That's why John's insisting on it so much."}
{"source": "So as we go along in 1 John, we'll engage inevitably in some sanctified speculation with respect to what John's opponents were teaching."}
{"source": "But the big picture is that 1 John is addressing these false teachers, addressing the way that they destabilized the confidence and assurance of the church."}
{"source": "So towards the end of the letter, John tells us the purpose of his writing in 1 John 5 verse 13."}
{"source": "John wants the church to know, to have confidence that they have eternal life in Christ."}
{"source": "I think if we understand these five ideas, we'll see what John's getting at, and we'll see how we can have the same kind of relationship with God that John himself enjoyed."}
{"source": "If you see there in verses one and two, John is talking about what he calls the life, or the Word of Life."}
{"source": "Whatever it is that John is talking about, it's got something to do with life."}
{"source": "John wants to tell us something about life, and what becomes clear as we look more closely at what he's saying here is that this life is not a thing, but it's a person."}
{"source": "The life which John says was with the Father and was made manifest to us there in verse two."}
{"source": "We'll think more about what it means that it was made manifest in a minute, but John is talking here about Jesus."}
{"source": "When John talks about the life here, or the Word of Life, he's not talking about an idea, he's talking about a person, the Lord Jesus Christ."}
{"source": "If you have any doubts about whether that's true, John makes it very clear later on in chapter five."}
{"source": "The first thing to notice is that John assumes that God wants to give you life, real life, eternal life."}
{"source": "Sin tempts us to think that we can only find life in seizing the reins of our lives and living for ourselves, but John is reminding us here that God wants to give you his Son so that you can have real life."}
{"source": "In the words of Jesus in John 10 10, life in abundance, true life found in knowing him, true life using your gifts for their intended purpose, true life lived out in relationships of love and self-giving and service to the joy of others, and true life into all eternity, ultimately living in a world that's been rid of sin and sorrow."}
{"source": "The second thing to notice here is that the Christian message is all about a person, so much in fact that John seems to almost confusingly conflate the message of life with Jesus himself."}
{"source": "But John tells us here, Jesus is the life."}
{"source": "You see that there in verse 2, where John tells us that this life is eternal."}
{"source": "From the very outset of the letter, John tells us that he wants to talk to us about something that was from the beginning."}
{"source": "The very first words of the Bible in the creation account in Genesis chapter 1 are in fact in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."}
{"source": "If you remember the way that John's gospel opens, it says there in the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God."}
{"source": "And so John is at great pains to make sure that his readers and friends, that includes us, understand that the Lord Jesus, the Son of God, the second person of the Trinity, has an eternal existence with the Father."}
{"source": "This is why the Apostle Paul can tell us in the book of Ephesians that the Father chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world."}
{"source": "No, John reminds us here that Jesus existed before the foundation of the world, that he has an eternal existence with his Heavenly Father, and so their love for us predates us."}
{"source": "And so John here can refer to him in verse 1 as that which, he says, we have heard, and we've seen with our own eyes, and we've looked upon, and we've touched with our hands."}
{"source": "This theme is going to come up repeatedly in 1 John."}
{"source": "Again, if we employ this idea of a mirror reading, it seems fairly certain that these false teachers that John is doing battle with were opposing this particular piece of doctrine."}
{"source": "But John wants to be extremely clear at the very outset of his letter."}
{"source": "But John is reminding us here he is a real man."}
{"source": "John says you could touch him, you could hear him, you could see him."}
{"source": "And what John is pointing out here is that that makes his testimony to Jesus credible."}
{"source": "And John says we have seen it and testify to it."}
{"source": "John is not telling stories here."}
{"source": "Remember in John 17 Jesus prayed to the Father that we might believe through the testimony of those he was sending."}
{"source": "Well John is one of the ones that he's sending and this is his testimony."}
{"source": "Because Jesus, the Word of Life, is manifest in the flesh and John has testified about it in his gospel account and in his letters, we, you and I, can enter into a life-giving, eternal, saving relationship with God."}
{"source": "John says, that which we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you so that you too may have fellowship with us."}
{"source": "John says there at the end of the verse that our fellowship is with the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ."}
{"source": "So John is making an extraordinary claim."}
{"source": "You see, John's not saying merely that he knows some things about God the Father."}
{"source": "John is saying that he knows God in this most personal way."}
{"source": "John's talking about knowing God the Father and his Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, the way you know your best friend, the way you have a sense of connection with a teammate at the end of a championship season, the way you might feel a common purpose with a business partner of many years working together."}
{"source": "John says he has that kind of relationship with God the Father and God the Son, the Lord Jesus Christ."}
{"source": "If you look even down into next week's passage, you see in verse six that John says, if anyone claims to have fellowship with God while walking in the darkness, right?"}
{"source": "And so John's saying we have fellowship with God, with the Father and his Son."}
{"source": "And friends, John's not bragging here."}
{"source": "So in John 15 verse 15, the Lord Jesus said to his disciples, no longer do I call you servants for the servant does not know what his master is doing, but I have called you friends for all that I have heard from the Father."}
{"source": "This is not something that John has figured out."}
{"source": "It's not something that John and the other eyewitnesses to Jesus's life have exclusive access to."}
{"source": "No, John says that he's proclaimed all of this to them so that you too might have fellowship with us."}
{"source": "But John's saying the reason he was commissioned by Jesus to proclaim this message is so that people like you and like me can have a seat at the chef's table so that we can be there, that we don't miss the performance, so that we can get swept up with him in the championship celebration."}
{"source": "And he sent this word, this proclamation, this testimony of John, so that you would believe it and trust in him alone and join in."}
{"source": "And that is that John is writing for the purpose of his own joy."}
{"source": "Now that might seem strange that John would tell us that he's writing for selfish purposes, that he's really interested in completing his own joy here, but he's not being self-centered."}
{"source": "And I think that's what John's going through."}
{"source": "I think that's the tone in which John offers this letter to us."}
{"source": "I think Mike Jones did an excellent job a few weeks ago helping us meditate on this truth from Paul's letter to the church at Thessalonica, where he talks about how the church there is his crown and his joy."}
{"source": "John's joy can't be complete until these first century believers embrace the word of life."}
{"source": "John is aware all throughout this letter that he is an ambassador."}
{"source": "Hebrews 12.3 tells us that Jesus, for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame."}
{"source": "There are a host of ways we could answer that question, but the author of Hebrews wants us to know that at least in part, he died on the cross because the joy of saving you was greater than the pain and shame of the cross."}
{"source": "John is like a friend with access to the best tickets, right?"}
{"source": "John is the friend who can get you onto Augusta National for 18 holes, right?"}
{"source": "John's trying to tell you that this is how much God loves you, that God, the father sent God, the son, so that you could have fellowship with them."}
{"source": "John doesn't really tell us what to do with this information."}
{"source": "It's a celebration of this fellowship that John's talking about, this friendship that we have with the crucified and risen Lord Jesus."}
{"source": "I think that helps us a little bit as we come to the Old Testament book of Leviticus, because if we're being honest, reading through Leviticus can feel like reading a bunch of instructions for really specific situations regarding a game that we don't know how to play."}
{"source": "This is Leviticus chapter 1, verses 1 through 9."}
{"source": "And so if you're just an innocent traveler through the Bible, maybe it's early February, you've finished Genesis, you've read Exodus, this is going to be the year you make it through the Bible in one calendar year, and you hit Leviticus."}
{"source": "We know from the book of Genesis and from Exodus that God's people were already offering different kinds of sacrifices to him."}
{"source": "And so part of the struggle with understanding Leviticus is that God doesn't take a lot of time to explain exactly what those sacrifices are."}
{"source": "The book of Leviticus assumes that you know what a burnt sacrifice is."}
{"source": "It's a bit simplistic, but I think it's helpful to think of Leviticus as a rulebook that explains exactly what to do in the various circumstances that might arise as the people of Israel seek to worship their God."}
{"source": "So Lord willing, we're going to spend five weeks in this book, in the Old Testament book of Leviticus."}
{"source": "In fact, in a couple of weeks, I want to make the argument that Leviticus is actually the very center, the very high point of everything we see in the first five books, in the books of Moses, in the Pentateuch, the law."}
{"source": "You see, the rules aren't the point of Leviticus any more than the International Cricket Council's rulebook is the point."}
{"source": "And when it comes to the book of Leviticus, the game that we're playing is a relationship."}
{"source": "That's what Leviticus is aiming towards, helping the people of Israel think through and understand how to have a relationship with the Lord, their God."}
{"source": "So L. Michael Morales, a preeminent scholar of the book of Leviticus, he wrote this."}
{"source": "He said, the dramatic movement of the book of Leviticus is one of deepening intimacy with God, largely answering the question, how can Israel dwell, have fellowship with Yahweh?"}
{"source": "He continues on a bit later, he says, Leviticus is about reconciliation between God and humanity through the temporary and symbolic means of the tabernacle cultus."}
{"source": "When we were studying through the book of Exodus some months back, we saw that God brought his people out of slavery in the land of Egypt, and he brought them into the desert to Mount Sinai, and he met with them there, and he gave them his Ten Commandments."}
{"source": "We saw at the end of our consideration of the book of Exodus that this tabernacle, where God's presence would dwell, it was clearly meant sort of symbolically to be a recreation of the Garden of Eden."}
{"source": "So the book of Exodus ends with the construction of this tabernacle."}
{"source": "And so we read in Exodus chapter 40, verse 34, this sort of climactic moment."}
{"source": "You think, this is great, this is perfect, this is what everything has been aiming towards all through Genesis and Exodus."}
{"source": "But the book of Exodus actually ends on this weird hitch."}
{"source": "And that's where the book of Exodus ends."}
{"source": "And so the book of Exodus just ends with this tension."}
{"source": "So the book of Exodus ends, and then the book of Leviticus immediately picks up."}
{"source": "And it's significant that the book of Leviticus is just a direct continuation on from the book of Exodus."}
{"source": "But if you're just sort of reading, you go right from Exodus into the beginning of Leviticus."}
{"source": "It takes place, the book of Leviticus does, in one month while the people of Israel are encamped at Sinai."}
{"source": "So we have dates at the end of Exodus and when the book of Numbers kicks off."}
{"source": "And the question that Leviticus is answering for us, as Professor Morales put it, is this."}
{"source": "In Leviticus chapter 1, starting in verse 1, all the way through chapter 6, verse 7, you have the Lord giving instructions to his people about how to offer five different kinds of sacrifices."}
{"source": "We see these five offerings listed out for us at the very end of our passage, so if you turn over to the end of Leviticus, chapter 7, starting in verse 37, there's a sort of summary statement there."}
{"source": "The answer to that, or the response to that, in Leviticus chapter 6, verse 20, we see that the ordination offering that's mentioned there is really a type of grain offering, so kind of as a subset of the grain offering."}
{"source": "So in Leviticus chapter six, verse eight, we read this."}
{"source": "Maybe you can pick that up in our reading from Hebrews 9 earlier in the service, that the priest would offer sacrifices for the unintentional sins of the people."}
{"source": "The idea of an unintentional sin is not so much that you didn't know you were committing sin, though there may be some element of that, but rather, as the book of Leviticus continues on, we'll see that the thrust of these unintentional sins are sins committed because of weakness or folly."}
{"source": "So it's not what we might call, or what the Bible sometimes speaks of, sin with a high hand, like we read about in Numbers 25, where someone publicly comes into the congregation of Israel and defies, sort of brazenly and publicly defies the law of the Lord in front of everyone."}
{"source": "In chapter 4 of Leviticus, we see a series of instructions for the different kinds of people that could offer a sin offering."}
{"source": "So maybe an example of this is what we read about in Joshua 9, where the people of Israel make a forbidden treaty with the Gibeonites."}
{"source": "Leviticus shows us worshipers offering sacrifices from a sincere heart."}
{"source": "He could pray to the Lord thus in Psalm 51, starting in verse 16, speaking to the Lord."}
{"source": "It was true in the days of Leviticus and it's true now."}
{"source": "Leviticus chapter seven, verse 23, makes it clear that this prohibition against eating the fat, it applies to cattle, to sheep and to goats, not to birds."}
{"source": "You can find books that tell you that Leviticus says, don't eat the fat because God is concerned about your cholesterol."}
{"source": "Anything that comes into the presence of the Lord, we're going to see throughout the book of Leviticus, has to be holy."}
{"source": "And if the question that Leviticus is looking to answer is how can sinful people dwell in the presence of a holy God, then the short answer is blood."}
{"source": "The picture of Leviticus is not an angry God demanding lots and lots of blood, lest he pour out his anger on his people."}
{"source": "Now, the picture of Leviticus is a loving God providing a way for his people to be graciously restored and renewed and forgiven so that he can delight in them and delight in their worship."}
{"source": "Remember, this is the point of Leviticus, that God and his people might dwell together, that the people of Israel might get inside the tent at the beginning of Exodus."}
{"source": "Leviticus says, here's how you get in, right?"}
{"source": "Well, I hope you can see that the answer is that this all points us to the work of the Lord Jesus, right, because these sacrifices in Leviticus were never meant to be permanent and lasting, right?"}
{"source": "The book of Hebrews tells us these things were temporary."}
{"source": "When Jesus, God's son in human flesh, offered himself as a sacrifice on the cross some 1,500 years after the giving of the law here in Leviticus, Jesus fulfilled and completed all the sacrifices that we read about, all of these offerings in Leviticus."}
{"source": "The only one who's lived a sinless life, Jesus having no sin of his own to pay for, he could offer himself on the cross, in the words of 1 Peter 1.19, as a spotless sacrifice for us."}
{"source": "Jesus is, in the words of John the Baptist at the Jordan River, the lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world, John 1.29."}
{"source": "It's here at the Lord's table that we see the fulfillment of everything the sacrifices in the book of Leviticus are pointing to."}
{"source": "If the book of Leviticus begins with Moses and the people of Israel unable to enter into the presence of the Lord, unable to come and enjoy fellowship and friendship and the presence of God for which they've been delivered in Egypt, Leviticus makes clear the only way in is through a sacrifice."}
{"source": "The first acts of God recorded for us in scripture are the creation of light, right?"}
{"source": "In Genesis 1, he sees the light and he says that it's good."}
{"source": "So it should, again, come as no surprise that when the Apostle John wanted to communicate the character of God to his readers in his first letter, he turns to the image of light."}
{"source": "Now you may remember if you were here last week, it seems that the letter of 1 John was written by the Apostle John, so one of the members of Jesus's inner circle of disciples."}
{"source": "And so in our passage for this morning that Torrey just read for us, we're going to see John begins to address some of those false teachings in terms of light and darkness."}
{"source": "First, let's see what John tells us about God, specifically that God is light."}
{"source": "If you remember what we saw last week, John reminded the church that he had, he says, testified to them and proclaimed to them eternal life in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ."}
{"source": "And we saw that the credibility of John's message was bolstered by the fact that he had seen Jesus with his own eyes."}
{"source": "And so here in verse five, John has a further message that he wants to proclaim to them."}
{"source": "John tells us here that God is light."}
{"source": "So in Psalm 27 verse one, the Psalmist declares, the Lord is my light and salvation."}
{"source": "In Isaiah chapter 60 verse 20, the prophet can tell the people of Judah that the Lord will be your everlasting light."}
{"source": "In Micah 7, 8, the prophet can warn his enemies that the Lord will be a light to me."}
{"source": "At first it's used to indicate knowledge or revelation."}
{"source": "So in Proverbs 6 verse 23, the father can encourage his son to listen to the instructions that he gives."}
{"source": "The Psalmist in Psalm 119, 105 can say to the Lord, your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path."}
{"source": "In Ephesians 5 verse 13, the apostle Paul writes to the church there and he says, when anything is exposed by the light, it becomes visible."}
{"source": "So this image of light has the sense of knowledge or revelation."}
{"source": "So again, the prophet Isaiah in Isaiah 5 verse 20, he warns the wicked."}
{"source": "In Isaiah's usage, light stands in for that which is good."}
{"source": "John himself writes in his gospel account in John 3 verse 19."}
{"source": "See, John says people prefer darkness to light because their works are evil, right?"}
{"source": "So when John says here in 1 John chapter 1 verse 5, that God is light, he's pointing us to the union of these qualities in the character of our creator."}
{"source": "He is light in the sense that he's truth and knowledge and revelation."}
{"source": "John presses this point home there at the end of verse 5."}
{"source": "John says in him is no darkness."}
{"source": "Listen to what Paul writes to Titus at the very outset of his letter."}
{"source": "That sounds a lot like what we thought about last week at the beginning of John's letter."}
{"source": "The author of Hebrews adds this in Hebrews 6, 18."}
{"source": "The author of Hebrews is writing to believers facing persecution, facing pressure to leave their Christian faith and go back to the Judaism that they've come out of."}
{"source": "But here John says God is light."}
{"source": "And listen, if you're presently not a follower of Christ, if you haven't come to God through faith in Jesus to receive that gift of eternal life, friend, do you realize you're staking your eternal soul on the hope that what John says here actually isn't true?"}
{"source": "And so Abraham prayed in Genesis 18, verse 25."}
{"source": "Before we move on, I just want to point out that when John says that God is light and in him is no darkness at all, he's pointing us yet again to the incarnation, the appearance, the manifestation of the Lord Jesus."}
{"source": "Remember last week we saw that Jesus is the word of life made manifest in a way that John could hear and touch and see."}
{"source": "What we see when we look at John's gospel is that he understands that Jesus is the ultimate and perfect manifestation of the light of God."}
{"source": "So John chapter one, verses four to five, it says in him, that is in Jesus, was life and the life was the light of men."}
{"source": "He did acts of mercy and kindness."}
{"source": "Let me point out two things that I think John tells us in response to that question."}
{"source": "So you may be able to see that John is going after his opponents here."}
{"source": "But if you remember again, back to last week at the end of verse three, John made the claim that he and the other apostles had fellowship."}
{"source": "And so John simply points out, if you make that claim that you have an intimate friendship with God, with the God who is light and in whom there is no darkness at all, if you claim to have close fellowship with that God while you walk in the darkness, you're obviously a liar."}
{"source": "John has told us in verse five that God is light, but here in verse seven, do you notice he says something slightly different?"}
{"source": "The truth here, according to John, isn't just something to believe, but at the end of verse six, it's something that we practice."}
{"source": "That's a truth that John expects will shape your Monday morning, right?"}
{"source": "This is what we saw back in the book of Leviticus, right?"}
{"source": "So we read back in Leviticus chapter 19, verses one to two."}
{"source": "This truth, this light of God must percolate down deep into us so that it comes out of us in our words, in our deeds, in our love, and in John's words, in the way that we walk."}
{"source": "John doesn't actually give us a ton of specifics about what that means, but it's clear that he's calling us to godliness, to embracing in our conduct the way that God himself is light and in the light."}
{"source": "If you remember back in Ephesians chapter five, verses three to five, the apostle Paul wrote this to the church."}
{"source": "Well, skip down a few verses in Ephesians five, verse eight, he tells us, he says, you need to live this way."}
{"source": "He says the same thing John says."}
{"source": "So Christian, back to our passage here in 1 John, are you walking in the light?"}
{"source": "John says there at the end of verse 7 that if we walk in the light, two things will result."}
{"source": "We expect John would say we'd have fellowship with God if we walk in the light."}
{"source": "But here John's emphasizing the fact that when we walk in the light, we're brought into fellowship, into an intimate relationship, into a common purpose and a shared task, not just with God, but with all the other people who walk in the light."}
{"source": "This is going to be an issue that John returns to later in his letter."}
{"source": "In some ways, living in light of God's truth and revelation, it actually makes us seem more sinful."}
{"source": "Well, John reminds us that there is there in verse seven, he says, the blood of Jesus, his son cleanses us from all sin, the blood of Christ, the death of the Lord Jesus on the cross as our substitute in our place."}
{"source": "John says cleanses us from sin."}
{"source": "If you will come into the light of God's revelation."}
{"source": "If you will come into the light of God's revelation of himself in Christ, that stain that sin has left on your life, John says, will be washed away."}
{"source": "Again, John seems to be addressing a claim of the false teachers that had infiltrated the church."}
{"source": "But whatever form this boast took, John is saying that it's born out of self-deceit."}
{"source": "John's saying if the truth were in you, if you understood what it means that God is light, if you had any insight into his holiness and his purity and his perfection, if you grasped some small sliver of what it is that God wants for his people, if you knew what it was to have this spotlight shining into every corner of your life, if you'd ever really looked at your face in that mirror, you would never conclude, yeah, I'm doing great."}
{"source": "So sometimes it's just easier to pretend we think it doesn't exist, but notice what John says there in verse nine."}
{"source": "If we confess our sin, if we agree with God's assessment of us, if we step into the light, if we drag out of the darkness, everything we're tempted to hide there, John says two things will be true."}
{"source": "John says he will forgive our sins."}
{"source": "And here John is telling us that God is willing and able to cancel that debt, right?"}
{"source": "John second says there in verse nine that he will cleanse us from all unrighteousness."}
{"source": "But again, God is willing and able to cleanse us, John says, from all of that."}
{"source": "But John says he's able to cleanse us utterly, completely from all unrighteousness."}
{"source": "The blood of Christ acts like the most wonderful bleach for our souls, transforming what was foul and dingy into something that is bright and pure."}
{"source": "And friend, in order to take hold of this marvelous gift, this forgiveness, this cleansing, John says what you need to do is confess your sin."}
{"source": "Listen to what John says here."}
{"source": "John says God is faithful."}
{"source": "Paul encourages the church in Corinth, in 1 Corinthians 11, 28."}
{"source": "And so maybe the best way to apply what John tells us here in 1 John 1 is to take time to confess our sins to the Lord."}
{"source": "The sermon passage this morning comes from 1 Thessalonians 4, starting at verse 1."}
{"source": "And over the course of the first centuries of Christianity, this understanding of sex eats like a kind of acid through the understanding that the Romans previously had of how sex operates."}
{"source": "Hebrews 13 verse four, let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous."}
{"source": "Ephesians 5.5, for you may be sure of this, that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure or who is covetous, that is, an idolater, has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God."}
{"source": "First Corinthians 6.9-10, we read this earlier, or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God?"}
{"source": "Again, Paul makes this point in 1 Corinthians, which we read earlier."}
{"source": "We put sin to death by the Spirit, Romans 8.13."}
{"source": "It's the letter of first Thessalonians."}
{"source": "So as we as we jump into this new book for a few weeks, it's probably helpful for us to get a thirty-thousand-foot view of what's happening in the New Testament, so we've been in Leviticus for a few months, or I guess a month and a half or so."}
{"source": "So the New Testament begins with four gospel accounts, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John."}
{"source": "This is actually the reality to which the book of Leviticus was pointing, right?"}
{"source": "So again, you remember in the book of Leviticus, there are these sacrifices of atonement that have to be made over and over again."}
{"source": "You move on from the Gospels into the book of Acts, and that's you see the resurrected Christ has empowered his people with the Spirit to spread the good news of salvation of people from all nations."}
{"source": "They're documented for us in the book of Acts."}
{"source": "So Silas is the same name as Silvanus, what we have here at the beginning of 1 Thessalonians."}
{"source": "So we have another New Testament book, Paul's Letter to the Philippians, from which we've already read."}
{"source": "We read about this account in Acts 16."}
{"source": "This is the stuff that's happening in the book of Acts."}
{"source": "This is the account we read from Acts 17."}
{"source": "You don't have to turn there, but Acts 17, you get this account of the birth of the church there."}
{"source": "Look there, Acts 17, 4."}
{"source": "Acts 17 again."}
{"source": "It's not uncommon in Acts."}
{"source": "To switch the metaphor that Paul uses later on in 1 Thessalonians, Paul is like a mom who has just given birth and is ready to nurse, but instead she's forced to kind of leave her infant on somebody else's doorstep."}
{"source": "You know, I don't know about you, but I think there are times where we can read the New Testament, we can read the book of Acts, or maybe we just think about these missionary journeys of the Apostles and we picture them just kind of jumping around from place to place on a whim, kind of unfeelingly."}
{"source": "This is not how Paul speaks of his own experience in the book of Acts."}
{"source": "This is the picture that 1 Thessalonians gives for Paul's heart for the church in Thessalonica."}
{"source": "This is what we see in 1 Thessalonians chapter 3, just kind of doing an overview here."}
{"source": "And this is why 1 Thessalonians, which may be Paul's earliest letter, is also maybe Paul's happiest letter."}
{"source": "You notice there, I think there's a really good kind of model for us here at the beginning of 1 Thessalonians."}
{"source": "And what's the church's job in the midst of all that?"}
{"source": "What's the church's job in Thessalonica?"}
{"source": "What's our job here?"}
{"source": "This is why we're calling this short series in the book of 1 Thessalonians, The Church in Waiting, because this theme is all over the book."}
{"source": "We can think that, okay, my job is to wait."}
{"source": "One of the things that 1 Thessalonians is going to teach us, just as clearly as any other book in the Bible, is that our eschatology, that is what we believe about what happens in the end, is the thing that drives our ethics, that is how we live here and now."}
{"source": "What we're seeing here at the beginning of 1 Thessalonians is that since we have a great hope for a great future in Christ, we are free to make great exertions now."}
{"source": "We saw this in Acts 17."}
{"source": "Maybe increasingly you receive job insecurities."}
{"source": "Word of God coming this morning from the book of the prophet Isaiah."}
{"source": "Significantly, this is exactly how God's people in Israel felt when they were being addressed here in Isaiah 40, which Brian just read for us so well."}
{"source": "So Isaiah 40 comes on the heels of a chapter in which God has warned his people about the coming exile that they're going to experience in Babylon."}
{"source": "Isaiah 40 presents to us what is, unfortunately, a universal sickness, experienced long ago in Israel, experienced now in our very own lives."}
{"source": "So Isaiah 40 tells us of a common affliction, but it also gives us antidotes, two antidotes, really, that I see."}
{"source": "I want to look at Isaiah 40 and lay out two things that I think we can do in this universal sickness, in the midst of this experience of despair, and that is we can remember and we can rest."}
{"source": "This is why right after the complaint in verse 27, at the first sign of God's people waning in their memory, Isaiah moves straight into undiluted reminder."}
{"source": "So their first task, Isaiah knows, is to remember what they've always known and what they've always confessed to be true about God, but which they're tempted to forget in this present moment of despair."}
{"source": "And how does Isaiah do this?"}
{"source": "Here at Isaiah 40, the prophet knows that we need to remember these things."}
{"source": "How does Isaiah meet the people in despair?"}
{"source": "It's hard to recall anything other than the pain that you feel, but right where you sit, Isaiah is reminding you."}
{"source": "If you'll let him here in Isaiah 40, he's reminding you of some very important things about God which your despair will tempt you to forget."}
{"source": "Notice, Isaiah wants you to remember God's great power."}
{"source": "That's what he's saying here, Isaiah 40."}
{"source": "And you would, as you would mark out the boundaries of house and the foundation, he marks off the boundaries of the universe."}
{"source": "We need, Isaiah says, we need to remember this."}
{"source": "Isaiah turns our eyes, turns the eye of the despairing Christian to the skies to contemplate the stars, the billions."}
{"source": "So listen, despairing Christian, we who are tempted to feel unseen and forgotten by this God, Isaiah would have you think of this."}
{"source": "This is how Isaiah reasons."}
{"source": "Isaiah says there's more about God's greatness that we need to remember."}
{"source": "His wisdom, Isaiah says, is unsearchable."}
{"source": "These are good, natural questions in a fallen world, but what Isaiah is getting at is that these questions are questions which they themselves need to be interrogated."}
{"source": "But what questions does Isaiah ask?"}
{"source": "Notice how Isaiah addresses our questions about God's actions, our permissions."}
{"source": "Isaiah answers our why questions with a roll call."}
{"source": "The Lord, Isaiah wants us to remember, he lacks no knowledge."}
{"source": "Isaiah just keeps going."}
{"source": "Isaiah, though, will have none of this."}
{"source": "What Isaiah says is, he says, look, look out into all the world, take in all the superpowers, all the threats, all the weapons of war, take it as it were, kind of in one large heap, and hand it to your God."}
{"source": "These so-called superpowers of the fallen world, Isaiah says, they are as nothing before your God."}
{"source": "In fact, this is what Isaiah is saying, if you made it your goal, the goal of your life, to offer some sufficient proportionate offering to this God, what you could do is you could gather every single one of the largest trees on earth."}
{"source": "Isaiah, he doesn't even criticize idol making, does he?"}
{"source": "And this is what he's doing all throughout Isaiah 40."}
{"source": "Listen, when you wait on the Lord and refuse to settle for man-made idols for your contentment, for your fulfillment, for your purpose, the end of your life, when you refuse to take refuge in created things, what Isaiah is saying is that you are not missing out on anything."}
{"source": "When you endure hardship for the sake of Jesus, when you set your eyes on things yet to come, things yet unseen, when all these all these temporary pleasures are being offered to you and you look past them to things unseen, what Isaiah is saying is that you are not being foolish."}
{"source": "And to this, Isaiah speaks, the existence of worldly opposition has never once threatened the reign of your God."}
{"source": "Isaiah would have us remember, listen, despite all appearances, your God is alive and well and reigning."}
{"source": "As soon as you think, you look out and you see that next superpower and think that they're firmly planted in the ground of history, he'll blow on them and they'll be carried away, Isaiah says, like stubble."}
{"source": "That's what Isaiah lays out for us."}
{"source": "Isaiah 40, 29."}
{"source": "Because what Isaiah is saying is that we can trust that God uses his greatness for our good."}
{"source": "So as he closes, Isaiah wants us to have two groups of people in mind."}
{"source": "Isaiah points it out."}
{"source": "That's Isaiah's point."}
{"source": "They will, Isaiah says, they'll mount up on wings like eagles."}
{"source": "The scripture reading for this morning comes from Mark 1, 1 through 15, be found on page 836."}
{"source": "Again, Mark 1, 1 through 15."}
{"source": "The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, as it is written in Isaiah the prophet."}
{"source": "John appeared baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins."}
{"source": "Now John was clothed with camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey."}
{"source": "In those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan."}
{"source": "Now, after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand."}
{"source": "Others hold that he was a miracle worker who did supernatural acts."}
{"source": "Well, this brings us to the gospel according to Mark."}
{"source": "Mark was a friend and co-worker of the Apostle Peter and the Apostle Paul."}
{"source": "And this is significant because it means that most of the people who encountered Jesus were still alive when Mark wrote his book."}
{"source": "You know, as modern people, it's easy for us to approach Mark's book with a skeptical eye."}
{"source": "But it's important to know that Mark isn't writing his book centuries later after Jesus."}
{"source": "As we read Mark's account, we'll notice that Jesus had a very public ministry."}
{"source": "And any one of these people could have objected to Mark's book."}
{"source": "Like if Mark is just making this stuff up, we'd expect at least one person to cry foul."}
{"source": "And so as modern people, I think we should be hesitant to approach Mark's book with skepticism."}
{"source": "It would have been very difficult, impossible even, for Mark to create a Jesus out of his own imagination."}
{"source": "For example, if Mark had written, one day after Jesus had finished teaching the crowds, he levitated into the air and he flew like Superman to Capernaum."}
{"source": "And I think this should give us great confidence as we open Mark's book."}
{"source": "Well, Mark is actually the most reliable historical source we have."}
{"source": "So we have Matthew, Mark, Luke and John."}
{"source": "Mark is actually the earliest and the shortest of these books."}
{"source": "And I think this structure is helpful because it provides the key to understanding Mark's purpose."}
{"source": "So we'll see there that the first half of Mark's book concerns the identity of Jesus."}
{"source": "Mark is answering the question, who is Jesus?"}
{"source": "Mark is answering the question, why did Jesus come?"}
{"source": "Unlike Matthew and Luke, Mark doesn't mention Jesus' birth or his early life."}
{"source": "We're actually going to discover that Mark's account is fast-paced and it's action-packed."}
{"source": "Mark is fond of the Greek word euthus, which is often translated as immediately."}
{"source": "In other words, there's an urgency about Mark's message."}
{"source": "No, Mark does not want to leave us in suspense about who Jesus is."}
{"source": "Mark opens his book with the Greek word arche, which means beginning or origin."}
{"source": "It's actually the same word that we find in the Greek translation of the Old Testament in Genesis chapter 1, verse 1."}
{"source": "In other words, for Mark, the arrival of Jesus is no less momentous than the creation of the universe."}
{"source": "In fact, Mark is actually going to show us that in Jesus, a new creation is at hand."}
{"source": "The next significant word that Mark uses there is the term gospel."}
{"source": "This is the kind of good news that Mark is talking about."}
{"source": "Getting the job you always wanted."}
{"source": "What Mark has for us here is good news like you've never heard."}
{"source": "That's what Mark wants to proclaim to us."}
{"source": "For Mark the good news is more than a set of truths."}
{"source": "For Mark the gospel is a person."}
{"source": "And so when Mark refers to Jesus as the Christ, he makes an astonishing claim."}
{"source": "The second thing Mark tells us about Jesus is that he is the Son of God."}
{"source": "We see that in Exodus 4."}
{"source": "So this is Mark's explosive introduction."}
{"source": "I mean, how does Mark back up his claim here that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God?"}
{"source": "Well, Mark is, throughout the rest of his book, he's going to give us ample evidence to make his case."}
{"source": "He says, As it is written in Isaiah, the prophet."}
{"source": "So before Mark introduces us to Jesus, he actually points us back to the Old Testament."}
{"source": "And although he only mentions Isaiah here, he actually combines two Old Testament prophecies."}
{"source": "So in verse 2 there, he cites Malachi chapter 3, verse 1, where God promised to send a messenger."}
{"source": "In verse 3 there, Mark cites Isaiah chapter 40, verse 3, which speaks of a voice crying in the wilderness."}
{"source": "And in the next few verses, Mark identifies this messenger with a man named John."}
{"source": "John appeared, baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins."}
{"source": "Now John was clothed with camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey."}
{"source": "John here has all the hallmarks of an Old Testament prophet."}
{"source": "So the appearance of John is massively significant."}
{"source": "It means that God himself is on his way, and John's task is to prepare the people for his arrival, for the coming of the Lord."}
{"source": "That's what the people of John's day needed to do."}
{"source": "Scores of people are coming out into the wilderness to confess their sins and be baptized by John."}
{"source": "However, John turns up and he says, you all need to be baptized, Jew and Gentile, no matter who you are or where you come from."}
{"source": "But as you can see, John's baptism is different."}
{"source": "And if you take a sneak peek at verse 9, John is going to tell the people that someone else is also going to need to baptize them."}
{"source": "Well, the message John is proclaiming is simple."}
{"source": "Some of us just do a better job at hiding it."}
{"source": "In the TV series True Detective, Matthew McConaughey plays a Louisiana detective called Rust Cole."}
{"source": "But John has good news for us."}
{"source": "The point of John is the point of someone else."}
{"source": "After John comes someone who is mightier than him."}
{"source": "In fact, John isn't even worthy to stoop down and untie his sandals."}
{"source": "Like, if you think feet are gross now, just imagine what they were like in John's day."}
{"source": "And so just feel the impact of what John is saying here."}
{"source": "It turns out John's baptism is just a symbol."}
{"source": "Someone is coming after John who will bring the reality."}
{"source": "So who is this superior individual that John is speaking about?"}
{"source": "In those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan."}
{"source": "Do you see what Mark has been doing?"}
{"source": "In other words, Mark's trying to help us to see that Jesus is the Lord of the Old Testament."}
{"source": "Why on earth is Jesus being baptized by John?"}
{"source": "In fact, John himself asks that very question."}
{"source": "Mark doesn't tell us, but in Matthew chapter three, verse 13 to 15, look what we read."}
{"source": "Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be baptized by him."}
{"source": "John would have prevented him saying, I need to be baptized by you."}
{"source": "We're going to see this more as Mark's gospel progresses."}
{"source": "Think about the flood in Genesis."}
{"source": "Or think about the Exodus."}
{"source": "Do you see why Mark thinks Jesus is good news?"}
{"source": "But for now, Mark is mainly concerned with Jesus' identity."}
{"source": "The word Mark uses there for torn is only used once more in his book."}
{"source": "Look at Mark 15, 38 to 39."}
{"source": "As we're going to see in the book of Acts, this is really significant because after Jesus dies, he rises again, he ascends to heaven to the right hand of the Father, and then he pours out his spirit on his people."}
{"source": "He baptizes his people in the spirit, just as John said he would."}
{"source": "It's announced by John, and now most importantly, it's confirmed by God the Father."}
{"source": "But if Jesus is the Christ, the son of God, then Mark has good news for us, because in Jesus, it means we have a savior, someone who can cleanse us from our sins and then can reconcile us to God."}
{"source": "The temptation of Jesus gets more airtime in Matthew and Luke."}
{"source": "Mark gives us a very condensed version here, but he makes it clear here that Jesus, this son of God, is actually an obedient son."}
{"source": "And as he goes into the wilderness, as he goes to be tempted, Mark is showing us something of Jesus' identity."}
{"source": "Now, commentators aren't really sure why Mark includes the detail about wild animals here."}
{"source": "Some think that he might be alluding to Genesis chapter 2, where Adam found himself amongst the animals, although I think this is a bit of a stretch."}
{"source": "Others think that Mark is trying to comfort his persecuted readers."}
{"source": "So, Mark is writing during a time when Christians were being persecuted by the Emperor Nero, some were even being thrown into the lions."}
{"source": "So, maybe this is Mark's way of telling his readers, Jesus knows what it's like to be faithful to God and be thrown into the wild beasts."}
{"source": "But whatever the reason, Mark's larger point seems to be to highlight the conflict with Satan."}
{"source": "This will be a repeated theme in Mark's book."}
{"source": "Now, after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God and saying, the time is fulfilled."}
{"source": "We're told in verse 14 there that John was arrested."}
{"source": "And that word occurs 10 times in Mark's gospel to describe Jesus being handed over to death."}
{"source": "Again, I think what we see here is Mark just highlighting that the gospel is going to come to us in the context of suffering."}
{"source": "Mark has good news for you."}
{"source": "It's interesting to know that the verbs that Mark uses here in verse 15, they signify continual action."}
{"source": "In other words, repentance and faith are not one-time momentary acts."}
{"source": "It's not, we don't just want good news, we want new news, a change of circumstances, a better job, a college degree, a dream house, a relaxing vacation, a loving spouse, a new baby, better health, more possessions, greater wealth, whatever it is for you."}
{"source": "Mark doesn't want us to miss this."}
{"source": "But Mark wants to proclaim the good news of Jesus to us."}
{"source": "Amen..txt Well, the sermon passage this morning is 2 Corinthians chapter 2, beginning in verse 12."}
{"source": "It's going to be on page 965, if you're using one of the Blue Bibles, 2 Corinthians 2, beginning in verse 12."}
{"source": "When I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, even though a door was opened for me in the Lord, my spirit was not at rest because I did not find my brother Titus there."}
{"source": "So back in Acts chapter 18, we read that the apostle Paul, having been in Athens, went to the city of Corinth."}
{"source": "So Paul wrote another letter, the one that we have in our Bibles called 1 Corinthians."}
{"source": "And at the end of that letter, in 1 Corinthians 16, he told them that he was coming to visit them."}
{"source": "He had to change his plans a couple of times, as we saw earlier in 2 Corinthians."}
{"source": "In 2 Corinthians 2, verse 1, he describes it as a painful visit."}
{"source": "In 2 Corinthians, Paul mentions this third letter."}
{"source": "And he says that letter to the church of Corinth by his good friend, Titus."}
{"source": "So he sends Titus over to Corinth, and then Paul himself goes north from Ephesus up to Troas."}
{"source": "And it seems that Titus was supposed to meet him there in Troas."}
{"source": "He looks for Titus, presumably on every ship that's coming in, and Titus doesn't show up."}
{"source": "And he went looking for Titus there in Macedonia."}
{"source": "Paul likely concluded that Titus had missed his window to sail."}
{"source": "So Paul tells us he was in Ephesus, he went up to Troas, having sent Titus over to Corinth."}
{"source": "He was worried when Titus didn't show up in Troas, so he went looking for him in Macedonia."}
{"source": "So let me just tell you what happens with Titus there in 2 Corinthians chapter seven verses five to seven."}
{"source": "But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus."}
{"source": "Paul did eventually meet up with Titus in Macedonia, and the joy of seeing his friend and knowing that his friend was safe was no doubt tremendous, but what Paul was really excited about was Titus's report that the church at Corinth had repented."}
{"source": "In some ways, the story that Paul is going to tell us here at the end of chapter two of 2 Corinthians, it begins shortly after the death and resurrection of Jesus."}
{"source": "So there at the end of Matthew's gospel, the risen Lord Jesus meets with his disciples and he gives them instructions on what the rest of their lives are really going to look like there in Matthew 28, verses 18 to 20."}
{"source": "Then just a bit later in the book of Acts, we read Jesus said something similar to his disciples before he ascended into heaven."}
{"source": "So in Acts chapter 1, verse 8, he tells them, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth."}
{"source": "In Acts chapter 9, we meet Paul, who at the time, his name was Saul, which is confusing but not our problem right now."}
{"source": "Later on, he winds up in the church in Antioch, and we read there in Acts chapter 13, while they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, that is the believers there in Antioch, the Holy Spirit said, set aside for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I've called them."}
{"source": "And this is the ministry that he's describing for us here at the end of 2 Corinthians 2."}
{"source": "And so I think that's the place where Paul's words here in 2 Corinthians intersect with our congregation and our lives."}
{"source": "But because that's true, because this work of spreading the gospel is work that we're called to as a church and we're all called to as individuals, we find ourselves in some way caught up in the same story that the Apostle Paul is describing here in 2 Corinthians 2."}
{"source": "So Paul tells the church at Corinth about his departure from Troas to Macedonia to search for Titus."}
{"source": "Paul is recounting for the church his experience sort of shooting around the Mediterranean world like a chicken with his head cut off, looking for his friend, going from one city to another, sometimes experiencing open doors for the gospel and looking for Titus."}
{"source": "He's not just talking about himself, but he's talking about himself, presumably Timothy, Titus, other people on his ministry team."}
{"source": "Remember back in Acts chapter 9, Jesus told Ananias that part of Paul's commission was that he was going to suffer greatly."}
{"source": "We read there in 1 Corinthians, Paul uses this expression in kind of a similar way."}
{"source": "In 1 Corinthians 4 and 9, he says, For I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all, like men sentenced to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world, to angels and to men."}
{"source": "This is also consistent with the way that Paul uses this word picture of a triumph in Colossians."}
{"source": "Their job is to spread the smell of Christ's victory everywhere they go."}
{"source": "As Paul says in Romans chapter 10, we read earlier in the service, they hear and they believe, they treasure him, and they receive eternal life."}
{"source": "Well, if you would take a Bible and turn to 2 Corinthians 8, this morning our plan is to consider together 2 Corinthians 8 and 9 as we're working our way through Paul's letter."}
{"source": "So in Acts chapter 17, verses 24 to 25, Paul says this to the people of Athens, the God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by man."}
{"source": "But suddenly, as you read the book of Acts and you see the church beginning to spread, by the time you get to Acts chapter 10, now Gentiles are repenting of their sins and putting their trust in Christ, and they want in."}
{"source": "So we read in Acts 15 that the leadership of the early church held a meeting to decide what to do about these Gentiles who came to Christ, and their conclusion was that actually Gentiles shouldn't have to live like Jews in order to be Christians, right?"}
{"source": "And here's how Paul summarized the result of that meeting in Galatians 2."}
{"source": "So in Galatians 2 verses 9 to 10, Paul tells us about this meeting to discuss how Jews and Gentiles relate to each other."}
{"source": "Paul says, When James and Cephas, that's Peter, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave the right hand of fellowship to Barnabas and me, so that we could go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised."}
{"source": "And so what you see in the book of Acts and in Paul's letters is that he was very devoted to collecting this money from the Gentile churches to care for the church back in Jerusalem."}
{"source": "So at the end of 1 Corinthians, he writes to the church in 1 Corinthians 16, 1-3."}
{"source": "So in chapter 8, verses 16-23, I won't take time to read it, but you can see there, Paul tells the church that he's sending Titus to them."}
{"source": "You remember from last week's sermon, we saw that the church there in Corinth loved and respected Titus."}
{"source": "So he says, I'm sending you Titus, who you know, and he said, I'm sending two other men as well."}
{"source": "We don't, we don't know who those last two men are, but Titus and two very well-respected, well-known brothers."}
{"source": "So that is Titus and the two other men that he was sending."}
{"source": "Remember what Paul told the church at Rome in Romans 8.32."}
{"source": "Back in chapter five, so second Corinthians chapter five, verses nine to 10, we thought about this a month or so ago, Paul said this."}
{"source": "Remember what the Lord Jesus said in Matthew chapter six, verses three to four, he says, when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing."}
{"source": "I think it's wise if you're in a season where you're facing financial uncertainty, like for example, if you have three kids in college at once, right, if you're facing financial uncertainty, if you're uncertain about your job or uncertain about some other aspect of your financial future, if you're tempted to be anxious or fearful or stingy, I think that's the time to press in seriously into considering generosity, right?"}
{"source": "There in verse 9, Paul quotes from Psalm 112 about the generosity of a godly man."}
{"source": "It'd be great to have more space, a proper baptistry, a nice entryway, but in reality I think our grace motivated generosity fits right into the narrative that Paul's giving us here in 2 Corinthians 8 and 9."}
{"source": "And in our passage for this morning from 1 John, we're going to see that John is reminding his readers of what's going to happen in the future so that they can be prepared now."}
{"source": "The plan here is to think together about the passage that Heidi just read for us, 1 John chapter 2 verse 28 through chapter 3 verse 3."}
{"source": "The passage that we're looking at today is really part of a larger point that John is making."}
{"source": "So remember, in the big picture, John is giving his readers a way to evaluate themselves and others with respect to their claim to be a genuine follower of Jesus."}
{"source": "And so John is writing in part to give them tools that they can use to evaluate what is proper teaching, to evaluate who really is a follower of Jesus."}
{"source": "John has wanted the church to see that if someone's life is not characterized by love, by the confession that Jesus Christ is Lord, even by personal holiness, John has said that individual is not to be trusted."}
{"source": "John chapter 2, verse 28, really down to chapter 3, verse 10, represents a meditation on what it means for us to live as God's children in terms of our relationship to sin and unrighteousness."}
{"source": "And John does that in reverse chronological order."}
{"source": "So we're going to cover those first two things that John's talking about."}
{"source": "Next week, Lord willing, we'll think about what John tells us has happened in the past."}
{"source": "So our outline for this morning is going to be the first two things that John talks about."}
{"source": "So I want to start with what John tells us is true of us right now."}
{"source": "You see, John wants to talk with us about our status as believers."}
{"source": "And specifically, John says we are His children."}
{"source": "John says we are God's children now."}
{"source": "So in Acts chapter 17 verses 28 to 29, the Apostle Paul says that we all, all human beings, are God's offspring."}
{"source": "But that's not the sense that John's using that word."}
{"source": "That's not what John wants to talk about this morning."}
{"source": "That doesn't mean that we're in a close and loving relationship with Him just because we are His offspring in the sort of general way that Paul mentions there in Acts 17."}
{"source": "But as Paul says in Ephesians 2, 3, we are children of wrath."}
{"source": "And it's that good news that John wants to tell us about this morning."}
{"source": "This is what John's talking about here in 1 John chapter 3."}
{"source": "John says, now."}
{"source": "This is what we read about earlier in our service when Marty read to us from John chapter 1."}
{"source": "John writes this about Jesus."}
{"source": "You see what John's saying?"}
{"source": "John says that that's not something that happens because of our will or because of the flesh, but rather it's something that has its origin in the will of God."}
{"source": "Here's how the apostle Paul puts it in Romans chapter 8."}
{"source": "When John tells us here that we are God's children, he is pointing us to this marvelous work of our triune God."}
{"source": "So John tells us here, that's what we are now."}
{"source": "Again, remember what we read earlier about Jesus in John chapter one in verse 11."}
{"source": "John sees the world divided into two groups."}
{"source": "Those who don't, John says, they don't know him."}
{"source": "And brothers and sisters, what John is saying here is that because we are with him, because we are with Jesus, because we are in his family, because we're spiritually connected to him, because we're, he's our older brother."}
{"source": "That's the first thing John wants to show us."}
{"source": "See what kind of love the Father has given to us, John says, that we should be called children of God."}
{"source": "It's almost like John's saying, what planet does this kind of love come from?"}
{"source": "He's just saying how amazing, how extraordinary, how unlike anything else we know that God would look at helpless rebels like us, that he would take convicted criminals like us, hopeless sinners like us, and not merely forgive us, not hire us to do a good job, not offer to tolerate our presence for all eternity."}
{"source": "John says, what planet does this love come from that the Father shows that he would take people like us and bring us into his family so that we're at the dinner table on Thanksgiving."}
{"source": "Who does that, John asks, unless they love extraordinarily?"}
{"source": "The great Puritan author John Owen calls this the great discovery of the gospel, that God the Father loves you like this."}
{"source": "So John wants us to revel in the love of God the Father, the love that he has shown to us in making us his children."}
{"source": "The second thing we want to see this morning is what John tells us about what is going to happen in the future."}
{"source": "John writes, and now little children, so that's his way of addressing the church."}
{"source": "So John speaks there in verse 28 of a future time, a time when he appears, a time, John says, of his coming."}
{"source": "John is focusing our attention here on a future date when Jesus, that's the him, that's the he, will return to earth from heaven."}
{"source": "The word that John uses there at the end of verse 28 that's translated at his coming, it's the Greek word parousia."}
{"source": "This is something that the citizenry would prepare for so they could properly welcome and mark the arrival of the dignitary."}
{"source": "John mentions that there in verse 28."}
{"source": "You want to have confidence when that person shows up, as John says there in verse 28, because you're ready for them, because you've been preparing, because you've been living in expectation of this grand arrival."}
{"source": "John says that's what the coming of Jesus will be like."}
{"source": "You can find many examples in the gospels, but just one in Matthew chapter 25, starting in verse 31, Jesus here referring to himself as the son of man says, when the son of man comes in his glory and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne before him will be gathered all the nations and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats."}
{"source": "The disciples who witnessed that were gawking and two angels said to them, men of Galilee, this is Acts chapter one, verse 11, men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven?"}
{"source": "The author of Hebrews tells us, so Christ, this is Hebrews 9, 28."}
{"source": "That's what he did the first time he came, but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him and the apostle Paul himself in Titus chapter two wrote to his protege that we as Christians are, he says, waiting for our blessed hope."}
{"source": "So when John here in John chapter two talks about Jesus is coming or when he appears, this is what he's talking about at some point in the future, Jesus will return from heaven to judge the world, to usher in a new heaven and a new earth."}
{"source": "John assumes that his readers already know that he doesn't, doesn't give any indication that he thinks he's sort of dropping new information on them."}
{"source": "John says we will see him as he is."}
{"source": "In John chapter 17, Jesus prayed that the father would allow the disciples to see his glory."}
{"source": "Paul told the Corinthian church about the return of Christ in first Corinthians 13."}
{"source": "John says here that it will have the effect of transforming us."}
{"source": "There in verse two, John says right now, we are the children of God."}
{"source": "John says we will be made like him."}
{"source": "No, John says you will be like him."}
{"source": "So Paul wrote to the church at Rome in Romans chapter eight, verse twenty nine."}
{"source": "There in verse 3, John applies all of this, not just to the way we feel, but also to the way that we live."}
{"source": "And so the point here, the reason why John is reminding us of this truth, the reason why the Bible speaks of it so often is so that we can be prepared."}
{"source": "John tells us in verse 3 of chapter 3, he says, everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure."}
{"source": "All of those people, John says, will now purify themselves."}
{"source": "The idea of purity is one that we encountered a lot of the book of Leviticus."}
{"source": "And here, John's idea is that if we have this hope, it's not something we sort of file away on a shelf and pick up when Jesus returns, right?"}
{"source": "No, John says we live now in light of that future reality."}
{"source": "John says we purify ourselves in light of the fact that we will one day be perfectly and completely pure and righteous like Jesus."}
{"source": "That love, John says, when you've really tasted it, when you've set your hope on it, when you've experienced it, it doesn't make you lazy and complacent and indifferent towards your sin."}
{"source": "No, John's saying again, this is the point he's going to make in our passage for next week, Lord willing, no one who's drunk deeply from that life giving water of God's grace can then remain indifferent to their sin."}
{"source": "This isn't something, John says, we just sit back and let God do for us."}
{"source": "As John says there in verse 29, if you know that he is righteous, you may be sure that everyone who practices righteousness has been born of him."}
{"source": "We purify ourselves as Jesus is pure, we rejoice in the father's love for us, and we, as John says there in verse 28, abide in him."}
{"source": "The sermon passage for this morning is 1 John 3, verses 4-10 on page 1022 in the Blue Bible in front of you."}
{"source": "1 John 3, verses 4-10."}
{"source": "That's the reality that underlies our passage for this morning that Dave just read for us from the New Testament letter of 1 John."}
{"source": "If you remember, that letter was most likely written by the Apostle John, so one of Jesus' inner circle of disciples."}
{"source": "And the congregation to which John is writing had been through something of a crisis."}
{"source": "How could these people who claimed to be Christians, how could they have beliefs and practices that were so far off the mark?"}
{"source": "And so into that mess, John has instructions for the church about how to tell whether or not someone really represents Christ, whether or not someone who claims to be a follower of Jesus really is one of God's people."}
{"source": "If you remember last week at the beginning of 1 John 3, the very beginning of verse 1, the apostle told us that in his great love, God the Father has made us his children through Christ."}
{"source": "And in our passage for this morning, John is going to tell us how we can discern whether or not someone else is really a child of God."}
{"source": "If you look at 1 John 3 at the beginning of verse 10, John tells us, he says, by this it is evident who are the children of God and who are the children of the devil."}
{"source": "And so here John wants to tell us, how can we figure out which person goes with which family?"}
{"source": "John's going to say, don't just listen to what they claim."}
{"source": "How can we distinguish those people for whom 1 John 3, 1 is true, right?"}
{"source": "Last week we considered 1 John 2, verses 28 through chapter 3, verse 3."}
{"source": "John has one big point that he's trying to make."}
{"source": "John is trying to show us that those who belong to God, those who really are God's children, will walk in righteousness."}
{"source": "And in order to demonstrate that point, we said last week that John wants to show us three things."}
{"source": "John says, behold, the manner of love the Father has shown to us that we should be called the children of God."}
{"source": "John reminds us that Jesus is going to return."}
{"source": "What's happened in the past and what that means for us today, particularly as we think through what John wants us to see in terms of our personal holiness and righteousness."}
{"source": "So if you look in your Bible in 1 John chapter three, verse five, we read this."}
{"source": "And then if you look down at the second half of verse eight, John says, the reason the son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil."}
{"source": "So John's talking about an appearance there in verse five."}
{"source": "Now, if you remember last week, John told us that Jesus is going to appear."}
{"source": "John is talking about a time in the past."}
{"source": "So John tells us that Jesus, the son of God, appeared 2000 years ago, and he wants to talk to us about why he appeared."}
{"source": "So John's going to tell us a bit later in this same letter."}
{"source": "In John chapter five, verse 19, he says the whole world lies in the power of the evil one."}
{"source": "So John tells us that Jesus appeared 2000 years ago in Bethlehem, and his mission was to destroy the devil's work."}
{"source": "If you look at the broad sweep of scripture, John doesn't tell us specifically here, but I think you can pull out three categories, kind of three things that characterize the works of the devil, three things that Satan is trying to accomplish, three tools in his tool belt that he seems to keep coming back to over and over again."}
{"source": "So you think about the example of Job, right, where Satan inflicts physical pain and even death on him and his family."}
{"source": "First Peter 5 tells us the devil persecutes God's children and causes suffering."}
{"source": "In John chapter 8, Jesus says that Satan is a murderer."}
{"source": "In Revelation 2.10, Jesus tells the church at Smyrna, the devil is about to throw some of them into prison."}
{"source": "In Acts chapter 10, verse 38, we read about suffering people there."}
{"source": "In Luke chapter 13, Jesus encounters a woman who is sick."}
{"source": "Again, remember back in John chapter 8, in verse 44, Jesus said this about the evil one."}
{"source": "In Revelation 12, 9, he's called the deceiver of the whole world."}
{"source": "If you look at our passage for this morning, there in the middle of verse 8, John tells us that he's been sinning from the beginning."}
{"source": "In Genesis chapter 3, we see the evil one planting the tragic seed of deceit with Adam and Eve."}
{"source": "In John chapter 8, Jesus told the people that if they would remain in his word, if they would be his disciples, in John 8.32, he says, you will know the truth and the truth will set you free."}
{"source": "In John chapter 14, verse 6, he declared, I am the truth."}
{"source": "In 1 John chapter 2, we saw that the apostle describes Jesus as the true light."}
{"source": "I think this is the main thing that John wants to talk about in our passage for this morning."}
{"source": "That's 1 John chapter 3, verse 5."}
{"source": "John reminds us there is no sin in him."}
{"source": "Let's turn now to see what John tells us about what that means for us today."}
{"source": "It's not too hard to put together what John is driving at, right?"}
{"source": "If you sort of pull out all the data that we see in this passage, we can group John's teaching really under kind of two headings."}
{"source": "First, John talks about righteousness, and he talks about freedom from sin."}
{"source": "At the beginning of verse 6, John says that no one who abides in him, that is remains in Jesus, keeps on sinning."}
{"source": "So Jesus is righteous, John tells us."}
{"source": "Whoever practices righteousness, whoever's life is characterized by the doing of things that please the Lord, things that are right and true and good and holy, that person, John says, is righteous because Jesus is, there in verse 7."}
{"source": "If we abide in Jesus, if we are remaining in him, trusting in him, looking to him as our king, there in verse 6, John says we can't."}
{"source": "There in verse 9, anyone born of God, anyone who's been brought into God's family, anyone who's had that seed of God's life planted in him, as he says there, anyone for whom verse 1 is true, that God has made them a child of God, they cannot, that person cannot, John says in verse 9, go on sinning."}
{"source": "Everyone who makes a practice of sin, John says in verse 4, also practices lawlessness."}
{"source": "John says, by this it is evident who are the children of God and who are the children of the devil."}
{"source": "The point that John's been driving to in this whole passage is this."}
{"source": "Listen carefully to what Paul says in Romans 8, 29."}
{"source": "Romans 8, 29."}
{"source": "What John's saying is you can spot a child of God because they'll be wearing personal holiness."}
{"source": "If you've been born of God, if his spirit has caused you to come to life, spiritually speaking, if you've been given eyes to see and a desire to leave behind the devil for life as a child of God, John says, then you can't keep on sinning."}
{"source": "John is very clear about this."}
{"source": "In first John chapter three, verse two, right?"}
{"source": "John says, we will not be perfectly sinless until Jesus returns, until we see him as he really is."}
{"source": "And if they begin to, one of the things that our loving heavenly father does for his children, according to the book of Hebrews, is discipline us, is to actually make sin that's beginning to taste sweet to us, to make it taste bitter, to make it painful and unpleasant."}
{"source": "John says there we cannot keep on sinning because God's seed abides in us."}
{"source": "For the children of the devil, however, for those still under his rule, still loyal to his rebellion against God, even if they wouldn't be consciously aware that that's what they're doing, that they're siding with him, John says for those people, sin is natural."}
{"source": "In the context of first John, the point is that these false teachers who have gone out from the church, they've shown their true colors, right?"}
{"source": "That's the point, I think, in the context of John's letter."}
{"source": "First, I think what John's talking about here can help guard us against presumption."}
{"source": "That's the situation that John's addressing, false professors, people who profess faith in Christ, people who claim to be God's children, but in fact, they are not."}
{"source": "So listen, John is not saying that the presence of sin in our lives is evidence that we are not God's children."}
{"source": "John is clear that if we say we have no sin, we lie and the truth is not in us, right?"}
{"source": "First John one nine."}
{"source": "Now the point is what John is saying here is that if sin characterizes your life, if it's the headline and if you're not doing anything about it besides presuming on God's grace banking on his forgiveness, well John saying you may well not be one of his children."}
{"source": "John never says that merely saying that you're a Christian or even intending to be a Christian is evidence that you are a child of God."}
{"source": "If you want to think more about this, go read Romans 7 today."}
{"source": "But here John reminds us that when we're brought into God's family, we receive the most wonderful kind of love."}
{"source": "John reminds us that God wants to bless you."}
{"source": "And so we purify ourselves now, as John said in verse 3."}
{"source": "Sermon pastors, today is Luke chapter 1, verse 26-38, page 855."}
{"source": "What I'd like to do with our time this morning is look at the part of Luke's narrative that Sam just read for us and see why it is that the coming of this child, why it is that the gift of Jesus, born of Mary, is such good news, something worth celebrating."}
{"source": "So first, at Christmas, we see that God intervened in the world, and you see that in our passage in Luke chapter 1, really in verses 26 to 29."}
{"source": "So if you have your Bible open, you see there in verse 26, Luke tells us that this story, this exchange between the angel Gabriel and Mary, took place in the sixth month."}
{"source": "Luke has just spent most of chapter 1 telling us about Mary's cousin, an elderly woman named Elizabeth."}
{"source": "Miraculously, we see earlier in Luke 1 that she has become pregnant."}
{"source": "That child, that miraculous child that Elizabeth will give birth to is John the Baptist, the prophet who will be the forerunner of Jesus's ministry."}
{"source": "And so as we sort of drop into the middle of the story here in verse 26, Luke is telling us that it's about the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy."}
{"source": "But what we see here in Luke chapter one is that God did pursue us."}
{"source": "For those of us who are Christians, just notice briefly here that when God acts, he also speaks."}
{"source": "And when he acts, he speaks, he explains."}
{"source": "God intervenes, he acts, and when he does, he explains."}
{"source": "When God acts, he speaks, and God's people respond, as Mary did there in verse 38."}
{"source": "As Luke says there in verse 31, he was born a son, but he's the Son of God."}
{"source": "This is what the apostle Paul is talking about in Romans chapter five, verse 12."}
{"source": "In Hebrews chapter two, verse 17, speaking about Jesus, it says, therefore, he had to be made like his brothers in every respect."}
{"source": "Now you may or may not be aware, but this little story in Luke 1 is ground zero for a theological controversy that raged about a century back."}
{"source": "God never acts if he exists."}
{"source": "So we see in 2 Samuel chapter 7, it says, moreover, the Lord declares to you, that is to David, that the Lord will make you a house."}
{"source": "So here in Luke 1, Gabriel is telling Mary that this child of hers will be the fulfillment of God's promise made to David a thousand years earlier."}
{"source": "He tells her three things the angel does that reflect what we see in that promise in 2 Samuel 7."}
{"source": "So for example, in Isaiah chapter 11, we read that in that day, the root of Jesse, so Jesse is David's father, the root of Jesse is this descendant of David that had been promised."}
{"source": "Many of the ladies of our church studied the Psalms together this year, and so you saw this promise there in Psalm chapter 2."}
{"source": "We see the Lord saying to his son who sits on the throne of David in Psalm 2, 8, ask of me and I will make the nations your heritage and the ends of the earth your possession."}
{"source": "Again in Psalm 72, David's son Solomon prays for the royal son in Psalm 72 verse 8."}
{"source": "Jesus the king didn't come to defeat the Romans."}
{"source": "God's salvation comes to us here in Luke chapter one with the greatest show of love and power imaginable."}
{"source": "Let's pray..txt Well, this morning we have a long end to a brief study in the book of Leviticus."}
{"source": "I want to jump right into Leviticus chapters 17 through 27."}
{"source": "We read in Genesis chapter three, that God would walk with them in the garden."}
{"source": "In Genesis chapter three, we see that Adam and Eve rebelled against God."}
{"source": "The idea was that it would be a new paradise of sorts that that, in a sense, is the book of Genesis right there."}
{"source": "We see that in the book of Exodus, that the descendants of Abraham, the people of Israel, they were eventually enslaved in the nation of Israel."}
{"source": "That in short is the book of Exodus and Exodus."}
{"source": "As we've pointed out a few times in this study in Leviticus, Exodus ends with the construction of this magnificent tent called the Tabernacle, made according to God's very specific instructions, made with lots of different furniture and symbolism that points us back to the Garden of Eden."}
{"source": "The final verses of Exodus tell us that God's God's glory, his presence filled this tabernacle, this giant tent."}
{"source": "And so the book of Leviticus represents an answer to that problem through the sacrifices and the priesthood and the cleanliness code that we thought about finally, as we thought about last week, the Day of Atonement ritual, sin, that thing that keeps humanity out of God's presence, sin could be dealt with, sin could be atoned for, the people could be made fit in a provisional way to return to God's presence."}
{"source": "And so now, as we come down from the peak of Leviticus 16 and that Day of Atonement, the question remains, what does it look like then for the people of Israel to live in the land in which the Lord was taking them?"}
{"source": "The book of Numbers, the next book in the Bible after Leviticus, begins the story of Israel heading into the land of Canaan to drive out the people there and take possession of it."}
{"source": "And so the question that needs to be answered in our passage for this morning, sort of between the Day of Atonement and beginning to enter into the land, right in light of God's mighty acts of redemption, his deliverance of his people from slavery in Egypt, his provision of salvation through substitution, as we thought about last week, his declared intention to take them into a land that flourishes and is peaceful."}
{"source": "And the answer that we're going to see in our passage for this morning, Leviticus 17 to 27, is holiness."}
{"source": "So if you start in chapter 26, so if you flip over to Leviticus 26, starting in verse 3, we read that the Lord said to the people of Israel through Moses this, he said, if you walk in my statutes and observe my commandments and do them, then I will give you your rains in their season and the land shall yield its increase and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit."}
{"source": "Right, this makes sense of what we read in Leviticus 18, verse five, he says, you the Lord says, you shall therefore keep my statutes and my rules."}
{"source": "It's the very same one that we see back in the book of Genesis to indicate the Lord walking in the garden with Adam and Eve."}
{"source": "If we've seen nothing else in the book of Leviticus, if you don't remember anything from the book of Leviticus except this, you remember that it is not safe for sinful people to be in the presence of a holy God."}
{"source": "The message of Leviticus is not be holy and God will save you."}
{"source": "So you see there in Leviticus 20, verse 22, you shall therefore keep all my statutes and all my rules and do them that the land where I am bringing you to live may not vomit you out."}
{"source": "And for our purposes, it's important for us to see as we look forward to that promise that holiness will be no less important there than it was back in the book of Leviticus."}
{"source": "This is why Hebrews 12, 24 in the New Testament tells us to strive for holiness without which no one will see the Lord."}
{"source": "So just in the passages I've already read to you in Leviticus 18, verse five, the Lord says, you shall therefore keep my statutes and my rules."}
{"source": "So if you look at Leviticus 19, 19, you shall keep my statutes."}
{"source": "You have a restatement of really the theme of the first two commandments in Leviticus 19, verse four."}
{"source": "So there at the end of Leviticus 1926 in the second half of that chapter, you shall not eat any flesh with the blood in it."}
{"source": "My guess, again, is that most of the things listed here in Leviticus 18 would seem like an abomination to most people in our day."}
{"source": "So if you look in Leviticus chapter 19 in verses 9 to 18, you see all sorts of instructions about how the people were supposed to live together there in verses 9 to 10, they were to leave some of their crops for the poor to come along and glean."}
{"source": "If you're familiar with the Old Testament book of Ruth, you know, this becomes an important plot point later there in verses 11 to 12 of chapter 19."}
{"source": "It all comes to a beautiful conclusion there at the end of Leviticus 19, 18, where it says you shall love your neighbor as yourself."}
{"source": "But I think we're tempted to read Leviticus and to read these laws, to read this holiness code and envision some kind of Taliban like society where everyone's walking around all day, terrified that they might do something to get themselves killed."}
{"source": "So we see there in Leviticus 19, verse two, speak to all the congregation of the people of Israel and say to them, you shall be holy."}
{"source": "Right now, Leviticus is giving a guidebook to the nation of Israel, how they can reflect the character of God to the world around them."}
{"source": "And here the promise in Leviticus is if they will, they will enjoy paradise in the promised land."}
{"source": "So in Leviticus 23, verse three, six days shall work be done."}
{"source": "Would you keep us until that great day when when all of the promises of the book of Leviticus, all the way through the book of Revelation, come to pass and we will be in the presence of our God forever?"}
{"source": "And so when the Apostle Paul sent his friend Titus to the church at Corinth, he seems to have experienced some godly anxiety."}
{"source": "So we read there in 2 Corinthians chapter seven, verse 14, the Apostle Paul says, whatever boasts I made to him about you, so whatever boasts Paul made to Titus about you, Corinthians, he says, I was not put to shame."}
{"source": "But just as everything we said to you was true, so also our boasting before Titus has proved true."}
{"source": "Paul is reflecting on the results of Titus' visit to the church at Corinth."}
{"source": "So if you remember back in 2 Corinthians chapter two, starting in verse 12, Paul said this."}
{"source": "He said, when I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ even though a door was opened for me in the Lord, my spirit was not at rest because I did not find my brother Titus there."}
{"source": "So he talks about that letter that they sent to him in 1 Corinthians chapter seven."}
{"source": "We call it 1 Corinthians."}
{"source": "After writing 1 Corinthians, Paul sends Timothy, his protege, to visit the church on his behalf."}
{"source": "In 2 Corinthians chapter two, verse one, he describes it as a painful visit because a large portion of the church was in open rebellion against him."}
{"source": "And he sends it to the church at Corinth, most likely via Titus, his good friend and another one of his proteges."}
{"source": "So it seems like he's referring to that third letter that he sent to the church at Corinth through Titus, confronting them in their rebellion as sort of a follow-up to his painful visit."}
{"source": "So Paul sends this letter via Titus from Ephesus, and he goes to Troas."}
{"source": "And he goes there, and he's doing ministry there, and he's expecting that Titus is gonna come from Corinth, having delivered his letter, and he's gonna meet Paul in Troas, and he's gonna tell him how it was received."}
{"source": "He's looking for Titus."}
{"source": "He wants to know that his friend's okay, but he also wants to know how the church at Corinth is doing and Titus doesn't show."}
{"source": "And so Paul goes on to Macedonia, hoping that perhaps Titus would meet him there because of the way that travel was dictated by weather patterns and wind then."}
{"source": "He hoped that he would find Titus in Macedonia."}
{"source": "That's where Paul left us in 2 Corinthians chapter two, verse 13."}
{"source": "So chapter two, verse 13, Paul's like, I was in Macedonia waiting for Titus."}
{"source": "So Paul comes into Macedonia, he's looking for Titus."}
{"source": "We read there in verse six, however, but God who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus."}
{"source": "That's second Corinthians chapter one."}
{"source": "You can read about that in Acts 18."}
{"source": "We'll read about that, hopefully, in 2 Corinthians chapter 12."}
{"source": "What brought him peace of mind was the arrival of his friend, Titus."}
{"source": "By the coming of Titus."}
{"source": "And besides our own comfort, we rejoiced still more at the joy of Titus because his spirit had been refreshed by you all."}
{"source": "So Titus goes to the Corinthians, his spirit is refreshed by them."}
{"source": "Paul sees Titus's great joy."}
{"source": "I remember back in 1 Corinthians 5, Paul warned the church that sin is contagious."}
{"source": "The Corinthians comforted and refreshed Titus."}
{"source": "Titus in return comforts and refreshes Paul and his ministry team."}
{"source": "But it wasn't just Titus's joy."}
{"source": "Speaking of Titus, it says, he told us of your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me so that I rejoiced still more."}
{"source": "Right, Titus brings back a report of three things."}
{"source": "Right, it seems here that the longing that Titus talks about is that the Corinthian church's desire to be reconciled to Paul."}
{"source": "The second thing Titus tells him about is their mourning."}
{"source": "Right, and this posture is reflected in the way they received Titus."}
{"source": "There in verse 15, we see Titus reflected to Paul on the Corinthians' obedience, that they received him with fear and trembling."}
{"source": "If Paul is an apostle, right, an apostle of the Lord Jesus, sent by the will of God, as he tells us in 2 Corinthians 1.1, right, so Paul is sent by Jesus, and Paul sends Titus to the church at Corinth as his go-between, then when the Corinthians receive Titus, they're really receiving Paul, which is really receiving Jesus himself, which, in the end, is all that Paul cares about."}
{"source": "But now Titus brings back this report that finally, it seems like they've turned."}
{"source": "What he was really aiming at, he says, is a revelation of the Corinthians' earnestness."}
{"source": "Right, that word that's translated revelation or reveal or manifest, it's an important one in 2 Corinthians."}
{"source": "In 2 Corinthians 5, Paul says that he and his ministry team, what they are is known or manifested to God."}
{"source": "We'll see later on in 2 Corinthians, it seemed that this individual had publicly humiliated Paul."}
{"source": "We've seen it used in 2 Corinthians to describe a good and godly fear of the Lord."}
{"source": "He rejoiced at the news that Titus brought because his severe letter made the church sad."}
{"source": "This is 2 Corinthians chapter 2 verse 17 through chapter 3 verse 18."}
{"source": "As we continue on this morning in our study of the New Testament letter of 2 Corinthians, you might remember where we left off last week."}
{"source": "Remember the very first verse of this letter in 2 Corinthians chapter 1, verse 1."}
{"source": "But in any account, right, this idea of commending is actually really important in the book of 2 Corinthians."}
{"source": "Just put a pin mentally in that word, because if the Lord wills and allows us to get through the book of 2 Corinthians, we're going to see this idea of commending."}
{"source": "If you remember back all the way back to first Corinthians chapter two, Paul said that when he brought the gospel to Corinth, it came, he says, with a demonstration of the spirit and of power, right?"}
{"source": "The book of Jeremiah and Ezekiel spoke of a day when God would put his spirit within his people."}
{"source": "We saw it earlier in our service in that passage from the book of Joel, right?"}
{"source": "He's indicating that he includes his coworkers, men like Timothy and Titus and Barnabas."}
{"source": "We saw that when we were studying the book of Exodus recently."}
{"source": "He brings up this strange incident that we considered back in Exodus 34."}
{"source": "See the problem, even back in the old covenant times, we read in the book of Deuteronomy that the people of Israel responded to the law of God with a hard heart."}
{"source": "In context, it's pretty clear that he's still referring back to this interaction that Moses had with God in the tent of meeting in Exodus."}
{"source": "And so what he's saying here is that those references to God, to Yahweh back in Exodus 34, are really references to the Holy Spirit being present with the people of Israel."}
{"source": "If you would turn with me to the scripture reading for our sermon this morning, which comes from 1 John, chapter 5, verses 1 through 12."}
{"source": "It's 1 John, chapter 5, verses 1 through 12."}
{"source": "On our passage for this morning from the letter of 1 John, the apostle is going to tell us about three crucial sources that testify to the identity and the importance of the Lord Jesus Christ."}
{"source": "So John's going to tell us who it is that testifies to Jesus, but let's look first and see what it is that they say about him."}
{"source": "So right there at the very beginning, you see the issue that John wants to put on the table."}
{"source": "I'm not going to spend a ton of time on this because we looked at this at great length when we were in chapter four, but John has, is writing to a church that has been infiltrated by false teachers."}
{"source": "John is at pains to make sure that the truth knows and believes the truth that Jesus is the Christ, that he is the son of God in the flesh."}
{"source": "So John's here speaking specifically about God, the father, right?"}
{"source": "First John, the book actually begins with the idea of eternal life and it ends with the idea of eternal life as well."}
{"source": "So in first John chapter one, verse two, we read about Jesus."}
{"source": "And then again, at the very end of the letter, at the end of first John five 20, we read this about Jesus."}
{"source": "So you have this idea of eternal life serving as something of the bookends of John's letter, but he doesn't actually tell us very much in this letter what he means by that idea."}
{"source": "So let me just give you a couple of places, just a sort of a selection of places in John's gospel where we get some description of what is meant by this idea of eternal life."}
{"source": "So in John chapter four, Jesus is speaking to the woman at the well and he says, whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again."}
{"source": "In John chapter six, Jesus says this, he says, for this is the will of my father, that everyone who looks on the sun and believes in him should have eternal life and I will raise him up on the last day."}
{"source": "Just a few verses later, John six 54, whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and I will raise him up on the last day."}
{"source": "In John 17, we listened in on Jesus praying to his heavenly father and Jesus says, and this is eternal life, that they know you, the only true God and Jesus Christ whom you've sent."}
{"source": "You get, you get a sense from those passages and again, that's just a sampling of what we see in John's gospel, but you get a sense that eternal life is so much more than just living on indefinitely into the future."}
{"source": "Eternal life as, as Jesus describes it, as he talks about it in John's gospel is, is living life as you were meant to live it."}
{"source": "And significantly you see here, what, what, what seems to be obvious from those passages in John's gospel that I just read, this eternal life is, is intimately bound up with the gift of the Lord Jesus himself, right there at the end of verse 11 of chapter five, John says this, this life is in his son."}
{"source": "If you believe in him, if you acknowledge him, if you love him as the son of God sent by the father to save you from your sins and give you eternal life, John says there in verse 12, if you have the son, you have life again at the end of this chapter, near the very end of his letter, John can even say he is eternal life, right?"}
{"source": "It's so bound up with knowing Jesus that at the end of verse 12, John can say it negatively."}
{"source": "So Jesus is eternal life to have him is to have all of those things that, that we just read from John's gospel, right?"}
{"source": "It's so connected to the gift of God, giving his son that John can say there at the end of verse 12, that if you don't have the son of God, you don't have this life."}
{"source": "Well, you see there in verses six and seven that John wants to talk about three witnesses."}
{"source": "John says the spirit testifies to it, the water testifies to it and the blood."}
{"source": "I think the most likely one is that it's referring to Jesus's baptism by John the Baptist in the Jordan river at the beginning of his public ministry, right?"}
{"source": "Now John clarifies for us there in verse six, that Jesus didn't come by the water only, which honestly wasn't something I was confused about, right?"}
{"source": "But John insists here that Jesus didn't just come by the water."}
{"source": "And so John says the water testifies to who Jesus is as we see the Holy Spirit descending on the Lord Jesus, as we hear God the Father testifying that this is the son with whom he's well-pleased and his death on the cross acts as a witness to who Jesus is, right?"}
{"source": "But John insists that there's one more witness, a third witness, the Holy Spirit himself."}
{"source": "In that sense, John's words here in chapter five are the Spirit's testimony because it's the Spirit that's inspiring him, right, pointing him to the meaning of Jesus's life and death."}
{"source": "I think that's what John's pressing towards."}
{"source": "So whatever interpretive questions we might have about verses six through eight, it's very obvious what John wants for us in verses nine to eleven."}
{"source": "If we do believe, John says there in verse 10, we have this testimony in ourselves, right?"}
{"source": "If we reject that, John says, we essentially make God out to be a liar."}
{"source": "John reminds us here, if you believe what God has said about Jesus, about his Son, then you have eternal life."}
{"source": "You are basically placing all of the eggs of your entire life's basket in the idea that what John says here in verse 6 is not true, that the Holy Spirit is not the truth."}
{"source": "Look at what John says there at the beginning of verse 1, everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God."}
{"source": "This idea of being born of God is one we've encountered already in 1 John."}
{"source": "But when the Holy Spirit causes us to be, as John says there, born of God, we are given as a gift faith to believe the testimony that God has made to his Son."}
{"source": "Just as we read the promise in Ezekiel 36 that God would one day do this for his people."}
{"source": "Just as Jesus said in John chapter 3 that we read earlier in our service that this sort of necessary work of God's Spirit was coming."}
{"source": "And that life manifests itself in faith in Christ so that John can say you can tell if someone's been born of God because they have faith in Christ."}
{"source": "I think that helps us understand what John says there in verses 4 and 5."}
{"source": "Three times just in those verses John talks about overcoming the world."}
{"source": "And so John says you have overcome the world with your faith."}
{"source": "If you remember throughout 1 John, we've really been seeing three tests, three ways that we can evaluate someone's profession to be an authentic Christian, three ways we can know if we truly belong to God."}
{"source": "And so it should come as no surprise to us then when John is talking to us about our faith, our belief, our doctrine, our confession of who Jesus is, the Christ who lived for us and died for us, it should come as no surprise that John can't talk about that for very long without also talking about love and obedience as well."}
{"source": "But there in verse two, John makes another connection for us."}
{"source": "Well, John says you can know if you love God and if you obey his commands."}
{"source": "So how is it that love for God and obedience to God can be so closely related that John can basically say they're the same thing?"}
{"source": "It's that kind of obedience that John is writing about, right?"}
{"source": "The life of faith, John tells us here, is a life of love and a life of obedience, right?"}
{"source": "These three things, faith, love, obedience, they're woven again throughout John's letter."}
{"source": "But John says one more thing here that I want to look at briefly before we conclude."}
{"source": "In all this discussion of obedience and love that grows out of faith, that's given to us by the Holy Spirit, John says something really radical there at the end of verse 3."}
{"source": "But here John reminds us, God's commands are not burdensome."}
{"source": "So John doesn't tell us these things, these are just things that we see in other places in scripture that I think will be helpful for you."}
{"source": "But imagine you were suddenly somehow blessed with the height and the strength and the freakishly long Achilles tendons of LeBron James, right?"}
{"source": "But here, John reminds us in chapter five, we've been born of God."}
{"source": "Psalm 135, praise the Lord, praise the name of the Lord, give praise, O servants of the Lord, who stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God."}
{"source": "Well, if you've been a Christian for a while, maybe Psalm 135 feels a little familiar."}
{"source": "And that's because this psalm is a compilation song."}
{"source": "So as one commentator points out, in this psalm, every verse either echoes, quotes, or is quoted by some other part of scripture."}
{"source": "Psalm 135 is somewhat of a greatest hits playlist."}
{"source": "And the imperative or the command of this psalm is hard to miss."}
{"source": "This is a psalm of praise, inviting us to join in to praise the Lord."}
{"source": "And it bookends this psalm."}
{"source": "Ariella goes upstairs to her room, Isaiah takes a nap, Heidi does some grading or she prepares some lessons for her Spanish classes and then I watch real football."}
{"source": "So back to Psalm 135, in calling us to praise the Lord, what this song is doing is it's actually inviting us to enjoy God, to delight in him, to find pleasure and satisfaction in God."}
{"source": "Well in the rest of Psalm 135, the psalmist highlights three things."}
{"source": "Now if you were here when we studied the book of Genesis, you might remember that Jacob, he wasn't a really great guy."}
{"source": "Listen to what God says to Israel in Deuteronomy."}
{"source": "So listen again to how Paul puts it in Ephesians."}
{"source": "In the words of Psalm 19, the heavens declare the glory of God and the sky above proclaims his handiwork."}
{"source": "So in verses 8 to 9, the psalmist references the Exodus."}
{"source": "We studied the book of Exodus not too long ago, didn't we?"}
{"source": "Verse 14 there is actually a direct quote from Deuteronomy, chapter 32, verse 36."}
{"source": "They offer no divine revelation."}
{"source": "In Isaiah 6, the Lord instructs Isaiah."}
{"source": "Or consider Isaiah 42, 17 to 18."}
{"source": "As an act of judgment, the people in Isaiah's day are made spiritually deaf and blind and dead."}
{"source": "So for example, in Ezekiel 14, God says this, son of man, these men have taken their idols into their hearts."}
{"source": "John Calvin said that the human heart is a perpetual factory of idols."}
{"source": "Maybe even to use the language of this psalm, the things that you're most likely to offer up praise to."}
{"source": "Jesus is God's final and full revelation."}
{"source": "2 Corinthians 3, verse 18."}
{"source": "He says he feels a divine Jealousy for them Literally, he says I feel a zeal from god The phrase that paul uses there seems to clearly be intended to echo back to numbers 25 If you remember the story there of of phineas in numbers 25 The idea is that phineas was outraged By the impurity by the false worship that was being manifested amongst god's people And so he took drastic measures to put it to an end You can read that story if you don't remember it in numbers 25 this afternoon And that's what we see here."}
{"source": "God gives good gifts to his children They take that truth and pervert it Into the only thing god will ever give you is all the money and all the health you want All god cares about is providing you with with stability and happiness Or even legalism Which takes the truth That god is very holy And that we are called to obey him And that no one can be a follower of christ without acknowledging his lordship and following after him taking that truth And turning it into a message of self-salvation through self-effort Right all of those things from outside the church and inside the church are threats to the church that come to us in the guise of friendship That come saying hey be holy be loving be courageous They come as angels of light They come with bible verses usually out of context They come with biblical terms and seemingly godly concerns But you know, they're false because they they tempt us To latch on to another jesus to a different gospel, even if we might still for now Affirm the the truths that we've been taught So church we need to be discerning We need to make sure that all of the elders that we recognize as a church In the words that paul writes to titus We need to make sure that all of the elders we recognize as a church hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught So that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it As individuals we need to be alert Right you you walk through a minefield Through a minefield Differently than you take a walk in a park, right?"}
{"source": "He says they're in the middle of verse 21 But whatever anyone else dares to boast of I am speaking as a fool I also dare to boast of that Are they hebrews?"}
{"source": "He who is blessed forever knows that I am not lying At damascus the governor under king eritus was guarding the city of damascus in order to seize me But I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped his hands So paul has pulled us back on the tracks He's going to indulge in a little foolish boasting But he says he's only going to boast in things that show how weak he is He's not going to boast like these godless super apostles about his knowledge and his money and his eloquence and his accomplishments Instead to show that he's a superior servant of christ He gives us a list of sufferings and weakness and humiliation And humiliation For the sake of time i'm not going to go into each one of the things that he mentioned You can take a look a tour of the book of acts and find a lot of the things that paul talks about Here in second corinthians 11 are recorded for us in the book of acts But the point of all of those things the reason why paul heaps them up the real thing He wants to boast in the real evidence of the legitimacy of his ministry Is just how much he suffered He has all the credentials that those false teachers could claim as israelites But they could not hold a candle to his far greater labors far more imprisonments countless beatings often near death Paul's not finished Sort of laying out his spiritual resume though There in chapter 12."}
{"source": "I will go on to visions and revelations of the lord He says we've covered heritage as an israelite check We've covered incredible suffering and humiliation check Let's talk about visions and revelations from god He says you're impressed by these super apostles Tell me tell me if they've had a vision if they've had a revelation like i've had as an actual real apostle That might be surprising to us to to hear paul speak in those terms It's a bit unusual, but we do know that he had as I mentioned earlier a vision of the lord Jesus on the road to damascus."}
{"source": "Jesus Confronted in his sin and that's how he became a follower of christ We know that other apostles like john had an extended vision when he was in exile On the island of patmos."}
{"source": "That's the book that we call revelation at the end of our new testament And so here we find paul lets us in on another such experience A vision a revelation we read about it there in verse verses two to six Paul says I know a man in christ Who 14 years ago was caught up to the third heaven?"}
{"source": "He will lack for nothing As he faces this difficulty Then the lord tells him why the thorn has to remain he says my power is made perfect in weakness Uh, the power of god is brought to completion it achieves its purpose in weakness Again, this is a theme we've seen throughout second corinthians Paul remember in chapter 4 talks about being a weak and fragile jar of clay to demonstrate the surpassing power of god And of course the lord jesus himself is the ultimate example of power in weakness Right, we can't think of paul being harassed or literally beaten with fists without our minds going to christ's Humiliation at the hands of the men who were holding him in custody before his crucifixion We can't think of paul pleading for relief from this suffering without thinking about the lord jesus Pleading that this cup might pass from him in the garden of gethsemane Jesus's suffering jesus's weakness jesus's humiliation before his enemies was the ultimate Perfect example of god's saving power being manifested through what looks like weakness And so again, we see what paul has been hammering throughout this book that that genuine christian ministry is carried out in a manner that is Consistent with the manner in which christ walked That's a lesson That he learned through suffering Again there at the end of verse 9 he tells us he moved from pleading that this thorn would be removed to now he says boasting in it He went from begging the lord jesus to remove it to saying this is what I want to tell people about because his lack Has proven to be an opportunity for the power of christ to rest upon him."}
{"source": "We can see it how he reminds the church of his methods in ministry So the way we've gone about remind ministry, he reminds them, you know, how we went about ministry among you, you know, you know So first Thessalonians 2 it's an apologetic for it's it's a it's a defense for Paul's apostolic ministry Chapter 2 is Paul looking at the church and reminding them saying you can you can trust me you can trust us But why is he saying this so so why this reminder why first Thessalonians 2 In short they and we will at some point in some way We will be tempted to forget that we can trust Paul's words about the gospel So we don't we don't know exactly What it was about the situation in Thessalonica that necessitated all this reminding from Paul."}
{"source": "So unlike other Situations the book of Acts doesn't tell us of any existential threat going on to the church in Thessalonica The rest of this letter it's it's it's not like Paul's letter to the Corinthians where there were obvious kind of on the ground threats to the gospel in this church But what we do know from Acts and from this letter is that there was still a big problem and the problem here is That Paul is not able to be physically present with the Thessalonians He had been there But as he's writing he's not Which means as we saw last week This church is in a particularly vulnerable Unprotected position So Mike Jones will really get into more of this next week at the end of chapter 2 and of in the chapter 3 into chapter 3 But think about their situation so Outside what we know from the book of Acts is it is the Apostles only spent a few weeks?"}
{"source": "So, I know there are I know there are books there's the internet all of that It's not realistic for us to personally know every person from whom we learn about the faith but if first Thessalonians 2 teaches us anything, it's that we got to have a category for the fact that character matters in Christian leaders as Believers we must care about the character of the people to whom we're entrusting our spiritual formation It is biblically required that the life of a true pastor a true spiritual leader match the content of the true gospel a Person's life their ministry their motives their methods."}
{"source": "It's motherly and fatherly and this makes sense Because God himself who is a father is figured as both paternal and maternal in the Old Testament Isaiah 66 13 he compares himself as one whom his mother comforts So I will comfort you you shall be comforted in Jerusalem Psalm 103 as a father shows compassion his children."}
{"source": "Amen The sermon text for this morning is 1 John 2, 15 through 17, found in your church Bible on page 1021."}
{"source": "On our brief passage from 1 John this morning, we're to consider the question of what or who is worthy of our love."}
{"source": "If you have a Bible, please turn to 1 John chapter 2, and this morning we're to consider verses 15 to 17."}
{"source": "So if you remember the context, what we thought about last time we were in 1 John, the apostles told his recipients that he's writing to them because he's confident that they belong to the Lord."}
{"source": "Doesn't John 3.16 tell us that God loves the world?"}
{"source": "If God loves the world, why is John telling us here, do not love the world?"}
{"source": "So how can John tell us here in verse 15, do not love the world or the things in the world?"}
{"source": "John uses the Greek word there, cosmos."}
{"source": "That seems to be what John means in John 3.16, right?"}
{"source": "This is what John means later on when he writes the book of Revelation."}
{"source": "And it seems like it's that third sense in which John's using this word here."}
{"source": "What kind of things is John talking about here?"}
{"source": "What John tells us in verse 16, he gives us some details."}
{"source": "So in Jewish thinking, which is most likely the way that John's using the phrase here, the flesh is a way of speaking about human nature."}
{"source": "So when John talks about the desires of the flesh, it's a pretty broad general category."}
{"source": "And John says we must not love those things, the desires of the flesh."}
{"source": "John says your human nature is going to produce things in you that you must not love."}
{"source": "So when John says, do not love the world, and he defines that world as the desires of your flesh, he is putting us at odds with most of the assumptions of the world outside these doors."}
{"source": "But here John warns us, the desires of your flesh, your most basic nature, those things are not good."}
{"source": "John says, do not love the world."}
{"source": "It's not so much what's going on inside me, but John's talking about what happens when my flesh comes into contact with the things I see in the outside world."}
{"source": "John says, do not love the world or the things in the world."}
{"source": "The word that John uses that's often translated there as life, it has a wide range of meanings."}
{"source": "It's pretty clear that's what the word means when John uses it just a bit later in 1 John chapter 3."}
{"source": "John is saying that part of what makes the world so spiritually dangerous, part of what it is that we must not love about the world is the ways that we take pride in the things that we own in our possessions."}
{"source": "And just stop to think about the fact that John could not have imagined a world like Northern Virginia, right?"}
{"source": "I think we have some sense of what John means by the world when he tells us, do not love the world."}
{"source": "As we mentioned earlier, John says here that these things are not from the father."}
{"source": "Here John is saying everything in the world, the desires of the flesh, the desires of the eyes, the pride of life, pride in possessions."}
{"source": "John says they don't come from the father."}
{"source": "Well in the rest of the passage, John gives us three motivations."}
{"source": "So the first thing John tells us is that we shouldn't love the world because if we do, the love of the Father is not in us."}
{"source": "So if we love the world, John says, we do not love the Father."}
{"source": "This is what Jesus was talking about back in Luke 16, when he said that no one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other."}
{"source": "John says, if you love the world, then the love of the Father is not in you."}
{"source": "When John calls us not to love the world, right, it's easy and maybe even natural to hear that as a kind of bad news, as if you're just about to get a list of a bunch of things you can't do, a bunch of rules, a bunch of things you can't see or taste or touch or think about or do."}
{"source": "A new car, a new relationship, a new house, a new child, a new job, a new purchase, a new movie, a new album, a new outfit, a new vacation, right?"}
{"source": "Can you see how it's good news when John says, don't love the world?"}
{"source": "You can have a relationship and a child and a car and a house and a job."}
{"source": "The second motivation John gives us is that we shouldn't love the world because it's passing away."}
{"source": "You see that there at the beginning of verse 17, John says, and the world is passing away along with its desires."}
{"source": "John reminds us here that all the things in this world, the cars, the sex, the movies, the money, all the things we're tempted to love, all of them one day will come to nothing."}
{"source": "And so John's point here is if all of these things are coming to an end, what good is it to invest your heart in them?"}
{"source": "And so John's asking here, why would you invest your love, the joy of your soul, in this world?"}
{"source": "John says this world is passing away and so it makes no sense to love it and the things in it."}
{"source": "John says, whoever does the will of God abides forever."}
{"source": "So the command in this passage, the thing that John wants you to walk away with this morning is the idea that you should not love the world."}
{"source": "So in verse 15, John can talk about loving God."}
{"source": "Now this idea that loving God and keeping his commandments are connected, this is not a new idea that John's come up with."}
{"source": "You remember Jesus told his disciples in John 14, 15, if you love me, you will keep my commandments."}
{"source": "A bit later on in this letter in 1 John 5 verse 3, John will say, this is the love of God that we keep his commandments."}
{"source": "Right in larger context of the passage, we should understand when John talks about doing God's will here in verse 17, when he says, whoever does the will of God abides forever."}
{"source": "And here John tells us that if we do the will of God, that is to say, if our hearts give evidence that we have experienced God's grace, if we show that to be true by loving him rather than the world, John tells us here in verse 17 that we will abide forever."}
{"source": "The world's passing away, but John says the one who does the will of God, the one who doesn't love the world and the things in the world, he says that person will abide forever."}
{"source": "And here John's pretty clearly picking up on something that Jesus said repeatedly."}
{"source": "So in John's gospel account, let me just read to you quickly a bunch of places where Jesus affirms this truth."}
{"source": "In John 6, 51, Jesus says, I am the living bread that came down from heaven."}
{"source": "In John chapter eight, he says, truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death."}
{"source": "In John 10, Jesus talks about his people saying, I give them eternal life and they will never perish and no one will snatch them out of my hand."}
{"source": "In John 11, to a friend struggling with the death of her brother, he says, everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die."}
{"source": "This passage, what John says here, is aimed at loosening our grip on the rails of a sinking ship so that we're able to take hold of salvation instead."}
{"source": "Remind yourself of what John tells us here, that the desires of the eyes, pride and possessions, those things don't come from your heavenly father who loves you."}
{"source": "2 Corinthians 5, verses 1-10, which you can find on page 966 of the Blue Pew Bible."}
{"source": "And so as we consider what the Lord is saying to us through his word this morning, 2 Corinthians chapter 5 verses 1 to 10, let's look at two things."}
{"source": "It's been a few weeks since we've been in 2 Corinthians together."}
{"source": "That's 2 Corinthians 4.17."}
{"source": "You see that in Luke chapter 23, verse 42."}
{"source": "We get a glimpse of this in Revelation 6, where we see the souls of those who have died for the faith, we see that they are in heaven."}
{"source": "In addition, Paul tells the Philippian church that as he contemplated his own death, he was torn between a desire to live and be useful to the Philippians and another desire to be with Jesus."}
{"source": "So he writes in Philippians 1, 23, I am hard pressed between the two."}
{"source": "That's what Paul told this same church back in 1 Corinthians chapter 15."}
{"source": "This is the same promise that we considered last week from the book of Jude, that God is able to present us blameless before the presence of his glory with great joy."}
{"source": "So the author of Hebrews writes in chapter 11, verse 1, now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen, right?"}
{"source": "So the author of Hebrews also wrote, let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful, right?"}
{"source": "It's the same word that Paul used back in second Corinthians chapter one."}
{"source": "This is clear from the book of Hebrews chapter nine, verse 27."}
{"source": "In other places like Romans 14, Paul talks about the judgment seat of God, meaning God the father."}
{"source": "Jesus tells us in John chapter five that the father had given him authority to judge."}
{"source": "So in Matthew chapter 16, we read that Jesus said, speaking of himself, the son of man is going to come with his angels in the glory of his father."}
{"source": "The very end of the Bible, in the very last chapter, Revelation 22, 12, Jesus says, behold, I am coming soon, bringing my recompense with me to repay each one for what he has done."}
{"source": "If you remember back in 1 Corinthians chapter 3, Paul wrote this, he says, now, if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each one's work will become manifest for the day will disclose it because it will be revealed by fire and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done."}
{"source": "The judgment that you face, that Paul's talking about here in 2 Corinthians 5.10, the judgment for Christians does not decide whether you are ushered into eternal wrath or eternal joy, right?"}
{"source": "According to Romans 5.9, we are justified, made right before our judge by his blood."}
{"source": "And he says there in Romans 5.9, and we are saved from the wrath of God that we deserve."}
{"source": "So it is true that we will face judgment, but it's also true that as Paul says in Romans 8.1, there is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus."}
{"source": "Don't think that God only rewards extravagant acts of service and obedience."}
{"source": "Matthew 511, blessed are you when others revile you, you ever been reviled when they persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account, rejoice and be glad for your reward is great in heaven for."}
{"source": "So they persecuted the prophets who were before you, Matthew six, verse three."}
{"source": "Matthew six, 17, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face that your fasting may not be seen by others, but by your father who is in secret and your father who sees in secret will reward you."}
{"source": "Matthew 10, 42, whoever gives one of these little ones, even a cup of cold water because he's a disciple, truly I say to you, he will by no means lose his reward."}
{"source": "But here, Paul reminds us of what we saw in Matthew's gospel."}
{"source": "We import so many other judges into our lives, and we magnify them so that they're so much larger in our vision than the Lord Jesus, right?"}
{"source": "We're going to need faith to see past all of the judges that are right in our sight."}
{"source": "The Romans reserved crucifixion for the very worst of criminals."}
{"source": "Through the cross, the Romans wouldn't simply defeat their opponents, they would humiliate them."}
{"source": "I wonder if you noticed, as Mike read from Mark chapter 15 a moment ago, that Jesus wasn't just killed, was he?"}
{"source": "Look again at verse 17 there of Mark chapter 15."}
{"source": "We see this right at the beginning of the Bible in Genesis chapter 3."}
{"source": "Romans 10 11, the scripture says everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame."}
{"source": "Well, if you have a Bible, please open up to Leviticus chapter 8 as Mike mentioned in the announcements We're going to be trying to cover a large chunk of scripture today."}
{"source": "The only way to enjoy the benefits of space exploration is to wear the proper suit and Maybe that idea helps us to think through the the tension that the Old Testament book of Leviticus seeks to resolve If you remember what we talked about last week the book of Exodus concludes with a problem Right when we were studying through the book of Exodus some months ago We saw that God brought his people out of slavery in the land of Egypt He brought them out into the desert to Mount Sinai he gave them the Ten Commandments and some specific instructions for building the tabernacle this elaborate tent where his presence would dwell with them and so at the end of Exodus we saw that the tabernacle was something like a Recreation of the Garden of Eden in the desert right all the imagery of the the tabernacle pointed us in that direction It was a place of holiness a place of beauty where God's people could enjoy His presence and so the book of Exodus ends with the construction of the tabernacle, right?"}
{"source": "You have this replanted Garden of Eden in the wilderness of Sinai and we read there in Exodus chapter 40 verse 34 Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle But there's a hitch in the very next verse we read this Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud settled on it and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle And so that's how the book of Exodus ends."}
{"source": "It's not safe for a human being to go in there and our passage This week as we consider Leviticus chapter 8 and 9 and 10 by the time we get to the end of chapter 9 not to sort of spoil things and get ahead of ourselves We're gonna see the resolution to that problem that problem of Moses being stuck outside The temple is gonna get resolved for us in our passage for this morning But before we get there, we're gonna see Aaron and his sons go through a really elaborate ceremony in order for them to come into the tent of meeting for the in order for them to meet with God in the sort of Smaller tent inside the larger courtyard in order to offer all the sacrifices that we thought about last week in Leviticus The priests Aaron and his sons need to be ordained They need to be commissioned for the work and some of the details that we're gonna consider this morning might seem strange to us But what's clear is that this ceremony is the only way that God's people can go from being stuck outside the tabernacle Kept at arm's length from his presence and his glory Kept outside this new Garden of Eden that's been planted in the desert."}
{"source": "That's the message of these three chapters in Leviticus."}
{"source": "This is the thing that the Lord has commanded to be done So God tells Moses to bring the people to the entrance of the tent of meeting Most likely this meant bringing the crowds sort of outside the tabernacle with the elders and leaders of the people Actually coming into the courtyard the purpose of this assembly as we'll see is taking Aaron so that's Moses's brother and Aaron's sons and Installing them in the priestly ministry of the tabernacle So last week we saw instructions about how people were to offer sacrifices How the priests were meant to work with the people to offer these gifts to the Lord Until now until this point though, no one's qualified to actually do it No one is actually authorized to perform those sacrifices And so that's what we see here in chapters 8 and 9 Aaron and his sons are being ordained and installed and authorized To actually carry out the sacrifices we read about last week there in verse 5 Moses tells the people what's about to happen is What the Lord has commanded to be done He's referring back to Exodus 29 Right there."}
{"source": "The Lord describes the ceremony that's about to unfold here in Leviticus 8 to 9, right?"}
{"source": "Well, we could do no No, Moses here is carrying out very specifically very clearly the instructions that God had given and so he highlights that there in verse 5 He says look what's about to happen is what the Lord has told us There in verse 6 of chapter 8 Moses takes Aaron and his sons and he washes them with water Just as was commanded in Exodus 29 verse 4 There in verses 7 to 9 of chapter 8 He takes the high priestly garments that the Lord had described in Exodus 28 and he puts them on Aaron Just as God had said in Exodus 29 verses 5 to 6 in Leviticus 8 13 Moses clothes Aaron's sons in the sort of regular priest clothing right again."}
{"source": "This is described for us in Exodus 39 Right, we we see here the priest being clothed in special garments and we understand the significance of special clothing Right if you see a woman in a long white dress with a veil, you know She's a bride right if you see someone in a uniform with a cap and a glove Okay, you know that's a baseball player If Joshua Louder shows up for church and he's got his full sheriff's office kit on right."}
{"source": "The high priest is dressed in a way that that shows he's sort of installed in a certain office He's being clothed in in garments that highlight the beauty and the glory of the Lord along with the very special nature of the task For which he's being set apart So these clothes are put on the priest and on the on the high priest Everyone's dressed for the part and it's time now for the next step in the ritual there in verses 10 to 11 of chapter 8 Moses sprinkles the tabernacle and all the utensils in it with a special oil that oils described for us in Exodus 30 It was olive oil mixed with cinnamon and other aromatic spices there in verse 12 He takes some of that same oil and he pours it on Aaron in verse 30 He takes that oil and some of the blood of the altar and he sprinkles it on Aaron's garments and on the garments of his son And what we're told there is that the purpose of the oil was to consecrate things That is to say to set them apart for holy use It's a way of showing that this tent this altar this utensil this basin these men They're not common."}
{"source": "They've been delivered from slavery in Egypt They have the law and now they have a fully functioning Sacrificial system that will provide for their atonement so that the glory of God can be manifest among them right if we look at the appearances of the glory of the Lord in the book of Exodus and we sort of take those as Our guide then what we what we have here in chapter 9 is a fiery cloud Descending on the tent Right."}
{"source": "The emphasis is on the presence of God that he is with his people There in verse 24 fire It says comes out from before the Lord and consumes all the burnt offerings and that sounds terrifying But in reality, it's a good thing It was a sign that these sacrifices that have been been offered on the altar were accepted by the Lord And so look at the end result there in verse 23 we see Moses and Aaron they bless the people So we don't know the exact content of that blessing But it may very well be the same priestly blessing that we see described in Numbers chapter 6 So we read there in Numbers 6 starting in verse 22 The Lord spoke to Moses saying speak to Aaron and his sons Saying thus you shall bless the people of Israel So this is the blessing that the Lord gives to Aaron and his sons that they should use to bless the people You shall say to them the Lord bless you and keep you The Lord make his face shine upon you."}
{"source": "That's glory imagery there and be gracious to you The Lord lift up his countenance upon you That's that's presence language right to be before someone's countenance or face is to be in their presence The Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel and I will bless them So it may well be that that's the blessing that Aaron offers here to the people But if not, it probably had something of the same content We read here at the end of Leviticus 9 the people are blessed They shout in verse 24 and they fall on their faces And I think that from context we should understand that shout not as a shout of abject terror But as one of joy and awe and triumph they fall on their faces and they worship their God who is with them Now before we move on to chapter 10 just stop for a second and notice what this teaches us about God I think the thing that might strike us first and foremost is the holiness and the glory and the otherness of God and that's Certainly, right the whole sacrificial system emphasizes the fact that sinners are not safe in the presence of God Right."}
{"source": "It all it all stems back to this Unfulfilled longing to be with God to be in his favor to experience him and to experience his approval So the Bible describes the presence of God As the greatest thing we could imagine the greatest gift that God has to give to us It is the reward that we get as believers at the end of our lives Remember Jesus says blessed are the pure in heart for they will see God Matthew 5 8 See friends in God's presence there is No sickness No sorrow, no sin, right in God's presence."}
{"source": "No hope no joy for all eternity so here in Leviticus 9 God has provided his people with a Temporary and provisional experience of that joy of the glory of his presence He has as we've said replanted the Garden of Eden in the desert and he is dwelling amongst his people He is with them as their God He will protect them and provide for them and they will delight in him And so they shout and they're blessed and they fall down on their faces and worship And you you almost want the Old Testament to stop in Leviticus 9 Right, it's like the end of a movie the music swells All the main characters that you've come to love are happy Right, and they're just gonna kind of ride off into the sunset and live happily ever after But that's not how life in a fallen world works and Leviticus 10 comes after Leviticus 9 And so look at what we read right there in the very first verse of Leviticus 10 Going all the way down to verse 7 Now Nadab and Abihu the sons of Aaron each took his censer and put fire in it and laid incense on it and Offered unauthorized fire before the Lord Which he had not commanded them and fire came out from before the Lord and consumed them and they died before the Lord Then Moses said to Aaron."}
{"source": "So some have speculated maybe that was in response to what his sons had done But in any event God had specifically warned against offering this kind of strange offering back in Exodus chapter 30 verse 9 we see these same words about unauthorized or strange fire and The consequences here in chapter 10 are swift and terrifying What we see is chapter 10 is a kind of upside-down version of chapter 9 In chapter 9 fire comes out from before the Lord and consumes the sacrifices here in chapter 10 fire comes out from before the Lord and consumes the priests Just as the glory of the Lord was present with the people at the end of chapter 9 So the Lord says to Aaron through Moses there in verse 3 among those who are near me I will be sanctified and before all the people I will be glorified Is a strong warning to the high priest if you don't treat me as holy as sanctified By your actions by by keeping my commands."}
{"source": "It's no surprise when Satan tempts the Lord Jesus in the wilderness That he tries to twist God's Word And it's no surprise that Jesus rebuffs him by reminding him that man can't live by bread alone But but by every word that comes from the mouth of God Here in Leviticus, we see God continues to speak He continues to explain and instruct and call his people through his word So just if you have your Bible open just follow along with this there at the beginning of chapter 8 The very first words are the Lord spoke to Moses There in verse 4 Moses did what the Lord commanded he obeyed the Lord's words In verse 5 Moses tells the people of Israel This is what the Lord has commanded to be done and then it becomes a drumbeat throughout these chapters So in verse 9 It's as the Lord commanded Moses verse 13 as the Lord commanded Moses verse 17 as the Lord commanded Moses verse 21 As the Lord commanded Moses verse 29 as the Lord commanded Moses there in verse 31 As the Lord commanded Moses there in verse 31 Moses tells Aaron to do what he commanded Right clearly because this is what the Lord had told Moses verse 34 the Lord has commanded there in verse 36 a summary Leviticus 8 36 and Aaron and his sons did all the things that the Lord commanded by Moses Everything we see in chapter 8 is specifically a response to the Word of God the command of God that in chapter 9 verse 5 they bring what Moses commanded there in verse 6."}
{"source": "You can't even rely on your own heart None of those things are Qualified none of them have the authority to interpret the world for us and rule over us and command our obedience like the Word of God does Perhaps the most important question you can answer this morning the thing that will shape your life now And for all eternity more than anything else is whether or not you will listen to the Word of God and do what he commands Right this passage from Leviticus shows us there is blessing when we draw near to the presence of God according to his word And there is terrible judgment if we disregard it And that brings us to the second thing for us to see that is that in these chapters We see a beautiful picture of the work of the Lord Jesus I Think it's obvious by the end of chapter 10 why this system of sacrifices is temporary and provisional The Levitical system left everyone on a razor's edge Constantly offering sacrifices for their own sins hoping that they would get it, right, right You see Moses's panic at the end of chapter 10 when he thinks that Aaron and his sons have messed up Right Leviticus 8 to 10 leaves us wishing That there was a sacrifice so perfect that it could just be offered once for all Rather than having to continually go through this process Leviticus 8 to 10 leaves us wishing For a priest so perfect that he could bring us into the presence of God Without any fear that we're gonna mess it up And Brothers and sisters, that's exactly who the Lord Jesus is and what he came to do As we read earlier in our service from Hebrews chapter 7."}
{"source": "He is the perfect high priest The author of Hebrews in 7 chapter 7 verse 26 says he's holy innocent unstained He did not need to offer Sacrifices for his own sins the way that Aaron did he had no need to offer Repeated sacrifices for the sins of the people because again according to the author of Hebrews He did this once for all one time for all when he offered himself up on the cross Hebrews 7 27 Jesus rose from the dead."}
{"source": "He ascended into heaven and he serves there as our great priest Right the tabernacle in Leviticus, it's a it's a shadow of a heavenly reality Aaron's ministry that we see in these chapters in Leviticus It is a shadow of what the Lord Jesus is doing for us in heaven He appears there in the presence of God not offering sacrificed bulls But he's there on the basis of his perfect sacrifice for us And so now we have a way to come to the Lord to come to his presence really and truly now and perfectly and permanently in eternity But friend there is no other way You cannot come into God's presence on your own anymore."}
{"source": "Then you could go on a spacewalk in your pajamas All right, Leviticus 8 to 10 makes that perfectly clear God wants you to draw near But you must draw near By the way that he appoints and accepts You must put on the righteousness of Christ by faith And you can't come to him Offering him your good works You can't come to him offering him a religion that that mankind has made up God calls you to draw near to him to experience the blessing of his presence only through the finished work of Jesus on the cross And when we come that way We have no fear."}
{"source": "We have an assurance of acceptance an assurance of God's presence And as you guys that's what we're doing when we come to the Lord's Supper Here in the the bread and the cup we have a visible reminder of the once-for-all sacrifice that Jesus offered So that we could come and have fellowship with God so that we could have a relationship With him so that we could enjoy his presence rather than being terrified by it When we come in faith We are we are obeying the command of the Lord saying you have opened up this way for us and We delight in it And before we come to the table it's appropriate for us to take time to examine our lives That's Paul's encouragement to the church at Corinth and first Corinthians chapter 11 verse 28 He says let a person examine himself then and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup This supper is for all those who have repented of their sins and put their trust in Christ Who have demonstrated that by obeying the command of Christ to be baptized?"}
{"source": "It's for every follower of Christ who's connected to a gospel-believing Church through membership Brothers and sisters the invitation to come to this table is a gracious one It is extended to you not on the basis of any good thing that you've done But because of what the Lord Jesus has done for you So to be perfectly clear the Lord's table is not a performance review This is not an opportunity for you to look at your week and see how well you've done See what feelings of guilt and unworthiness you might have and decide whether you clear the bar to come take the Lord's Supper This is a meal for anyone who is a sinner saved by grace But with that said it's not something we should take lightly again Leviticus 8 to 10 Reminds us of that So if you know yourself not to be a Christian Then this meal is not for you at least not yet So instead of coming forward use this time to think about your need for a Savior For a priest who will go on your behalf into the presence of God If you claim to be a follower of Christ but your life is marked by sin that you have no intention of ever turning from if you insist on holding on to bitterness against your brother or a sister in Christ, then Do what a Christian does and repent of your sin?"}
{"source": "The sermon passage for this morning is 1 Thessalonians 4, 9-12 and that can be found on page 987 in the Pew Bible in front of you."}
{"source": "1 Thessalonians 4, 9-12 and this is the word of God."}
{"source": "The first of these we covered last time we were in 1 Thessalonians."}
{"source": "Mike Jones led us so well through 1 Thessalonians 4, the first part of it."}
{"source": "So here Paul continues on, 1 Thessalonians 4, verses 9 through 12, and he lays out two realities that help us understand what it means to wait well."}
{"source": "1 Corinthians 13, right?"}
{"source": "And that's totally appropriate, right, to get a vision of love from 1 Corinthians 13 at a wedding."}
{"source": "But we should remember that 1 Corinthians 13 was written to the church as a picture of what love really is."}
{"source": "1 Corinthians 13."}
{"source": "So I don't know about you, but I find the love chapter of 1 Corinthians 13 very instructional."}
{"source": "So we won't read the whole thing there, 1 Corinthians 13."}
{"source": "Look there at 1 Corinthians 13 verse 4."}
{"source": "Paul says this in Ephesians 4, be kind to one another."}
{"source": "Brotherly love is kind, and it seems like this is kind of simply fleshed out in the rest of what Paul says there in 1 Corinthians 13."}
{"source": "Have you ever noticed the overlap of the fruit of the Spirit in Galatians 5 and the description of love in 1 Corinthians 13?"}
{"source": "Look there, back in 1 Thessalonians 4, verse 10."}
{"source": "He kind of more clearly, more directly explains this over in his second letter to the church, 2 Thessalonians 3."}
{"source": "So these are, Paul addresses these people in 2 Thessalonians, right?"}
{"source": "You see that in 2 Thessalonians 3.11?"}
{"source": "Back in 2 Thessalonians chapter 3, read it again, he says, You know, again, this doesn't undercut the reality that's affirmed in the New Testament that the church will always have members who are in legitimate need of benevolent care, of provision."}
{"source": "The New Testament lays it out in a couple ways, Acts 20, 35."}
{"source": "The apostle says, Maybe a surprising exhortation, Ephesians 4, 28."}
{"source": "So, as Paul's writing Ephesians, one of the great blessings for a thief-turned-Christian is that he now gets the joy, not of stealing from other people, but of working honestly so that he might have something to share with other people."}
