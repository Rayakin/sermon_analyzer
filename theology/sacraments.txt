Topic: Sacraments: Baptism & the Lord's Supper

Description:
In the Christian tradition, sacraments are rites instituted by Christ that are outward and visible signs of an inward and spiritual grace. Among the universally recognized sacraments, two hold a place of particular prominence across the vast majority of Christian denominations: Baptism and the Eucharist, commonly referred to as the Lord's Supper. These sacred observances serve as both symbols and instruments of divine grace, encapsulating the mysteries of faith and the narrative of salvation.

Baptism
Theological Significance
Baptism derives from the Greek word "baptizo," meaning to wash or immerse. Theologically, it signifies purification from sin, entry into the mystical body of Christâ€”the Church, and the birth into a new life in the Holy Spirit. Baptism is rooted in the ministry of John the Baptist and finds its ultimate validation in the baptism of Jesus by John in the Jordan River.

Biblical Foundation
The scriptural basis for baptism is found in the Great Commission of Jesus to his disciples in the Gospel of Matthew (28:19-20), where he commands them to make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Other New Testament references elucidate the significance of baptism (Romans 6:3-4, 1 Peter 3:21).

Practice and Variance
The mode of baptism can vary from immersion, pouring, to sprinkling, each expressing the theological symbolism of cleansing and rebirth. Infants and adults are baptized depending on denominational beliefs about original sin, personal accountability, and the role of faith in salvation. The Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican, Lutheran, and other mainline Protestant churches practice infant baptism, signifying incorporation into the covenant community, while groups like Baptists and Anabaptists reserve baptism for those who profess personal faith.

The Lord's Supper
Theological Significance
The Lord's Supper, or Eucharist, is a sacrament that commemorates the Last Supper, where Jesus shared bread and wine with his disciples, ascribing to them his body and blood, and commanded them to "do this in remembrance of me" (Luke 22:19, 1 Corinthians 11:24-25). The sacred meal is a profound mystery encompassing remembrance, communion, and hope in the eschatological banquet of the Kingdom of God.
