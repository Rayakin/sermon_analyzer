Biblical anthropology is the theological study of humanity according to the Christian Scriptures, focusing on human identity, destiny, and purpose. At its core is the belief that humans are made in the image of God, possessing divine likeness and intrinsic dignity, which frames human worth and ethical behavior.

Humanity's composition is scrutinized through biblical terms such as "soul" and "spirit," sparking theological debates over dualistic versus holistic views of the body and soul. This influences Christian views on life, death, and the afterlife.

The Fall, as detailed in Genesis 3, marks a disruption in human harmony, introducing original sin and the tendency towards disobedience inherent in human nature.

The concept of free will is balanced against divine sovereignty in the Scriptures, probing the limits of human agency within God's plans.

Salvation is central to biblical anthropology, outlining a narrative of redemption through Jesus Christ and pointing to a future hope with the resurrection, judgment, and renewal of all creation.

Contemporary implications of biblical anthropology span ethics and social issues, informing views on human rights, gender equality, and environmental stewardship from a Christian perspective.

Biblical anthropology remains vital to understanding human existence, encouraging living responsibly post-Fall and seeking wholeness through the Gospel, resonating with modern believers.
