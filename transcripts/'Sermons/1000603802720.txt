Well, if you would turn in your bulletin to the Proverbs that Genilee read for us earlier, those will serve as our sermon text today. The introduction to the book of Proverbs, you may remember, tells us that the book was written to teach us wisdom, to teach us how to live skillfully in the fear of the Lord. This morning we're continuing our study through some of the various topics addressed throughout the book of Proverbs, especially in those two-line sentence Proverbs that we find throughout chapters 10 to 31. And as we've examined what Proverbs says about how to live wisely in various facets of our lives over the past few weeks, we've made repeated reference to this idea that human beings are created in the image of God. We were created to be living pictures of God's character and glory. And so we've seen that living skillfully is a matter of reflecting the image of God in our lives. We were meant to use our words like God uses His words truthfully and in a way that gives life. We're meant to work like God works in a way that creates order and promotes flourishing. We're meant to use our stuff like God uses stuff, not to trust in it, but to use it for prudent and loving and God-glorifying and generous ends. This morning we are considering what the book of Proverbs says to us about friendship. And before we dive into the specific Proverbs that Gentile read for us, I want to point out that the reason that friendship is important is once again ultimately because of what God is like. So this may sound a little bit abstract, but ultimately friendship is important because the God who made the world is a Trinity. He is three in one. So the Bible teaches that the God who created the world has existed eternally as one God in three persons. God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. The Bible says that before God made the world, He was not lonely. God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, in fact, have existed forever in an eternal and perfect relationship of mutual love and knowledge and shared glory. Jesus talks about this relationship in His prayer to the Father in John 17. He talks about the love that the Father had for Him before the foundation of the world and the glory that the members of the Trinity shared with each other before anything else existed. And so it's fitting that that God, the triune God, would create a world populated by image bearers who, like Him, are made to function with relationships of knowing and loving. The reason that we know that God esteems friendship in particular as an important form of a knowledge and love relationship is because we know from the Bible that Jesus made friends. You see, the Bible teaches that in the course of human history, God the Son of the eternal second person of the Trinity, He took on Himself a human nature and was named Jesus in order to save image bearers who had rebelled against Him. Jesus was the perfect human image bearer of God. If you want to know what God is like, look at Jesus. And what we see when we look at Jesus is that Jesus made friends. When Jesus chose 12 apostles, we're told in the gospel of Mark that He told them not only that He might teach them, but He chose them so that they might be with Him, Mark says. In John chapter 13, Jesus calls the disciples that He had chosen His friends. One of these disciples named John, he describes himself as the disciple whom Jesus loved because of Jesus' personal kindness to him. John writes about leaning up against Jesus during a shared meal, Jesus his friend. In John's gospel, we also learn that Jesus was friends with a set of siblings named Mary and Martha and Lazarus. He knew them personally. He cared about how they were doing. He had a relationship with them. And of course, famously, Jesus was criticized by His opponents as a friend of tax collectors and sinners. He was a friend of a glorious God who condescends to be friends with sinners. Brothers and sisters, if there was anyone who didn't need friends, it was Jesus. But Jesus, the supremely wise man, the most skillful man who ever lived, the person who most clearly reflects the image of God, He pursued friendships. See, I think we can be tempted to view friendship as sort of a nice extra to life. Friendships are mainly about having fun, so they're good if they happen to happen, but they're not really worth pursuing per se. The life of the Lord Jesus in the book of Proverbs would suggest to us that it's wise to pursue friends. If we want to do life well, we ought to pursue friendships. So three questions to structure our time this morning as we look together at what Proverbs says about this more important than we might think subject of friendship. Three questions to structure our time. First, why is friendship good? Second question, how does friendship go wrong? And third question, how do we do friendship wisely? Why is friendship good? How does friendship go wrong, and how do we do it wisely? First question, why is friendship good? Well, Proverbs gives us several reasons. The first reason, very simply, is that friendship brings us joy, right? Friends make life happier. I don't need a Bible verse to prove this to you, right? The way that Proverbs talks about friends, it seems to assume that you will seek friends like it assumes that you'll seek food, right? Even the introverts among us are to some extent wired to want friendship and to see it as a source of joy. So I don't need a Bible verse to prove that to you, but I've got one anyway. In fact, I've got three. So look together at Proverbs 27, verse 9. It says, oil and perfume make the heart glad, and the sweetness of a friend comes from his earnest counsel. That second line there, it's possible to translate that verse as the Christian standard Bible does. I think I prefer this translation. It says, and the sweetness of a friend is better than self-counsel. Or the sweetness of a friend is better than the counsel of your own soul. It's better to have a friend than to just kick your own problems around in your heart by yourself. You see, when you've got things on your heart and you have a friend to whom you can open up about them, with whom you can take counsel together, it's sweet. It's one of the sweetest things in life. And look at Proverbs 15, 17. Certainly applies to families, but also to friendships. It says, better is a dinner of herbs where love is than a fattened ox and hatred with it. We saw this last week. Loving relationships beat creature comforts for lasting joy. Sharing food with friends who love each other, even if the food is not that great. Even if you dish up a dinner of herbs, sharing food with friends who love each other, that is one of life's great joys. I hope you get to do that. I also hope you have better than a dish of herbs. But even if you don't, I hope you enjoy lasting friendships and love with people with whom you share food. Friendship brings us joy. Look at Proverbs 10, 7. Proverbs 10, 7. It says, the memory of the righteous is a blessing, but the name of the wicked will rot. Just the memory of good friends can be an ongoing source of joy. So I know for a fact that there is joy among the saints at Franconia Baptist Church because of the Roark family, right? Nick Roark, the pastor of Franconia Baptist Church for seven years. There's joy in the saints here at Franconia because of the Roark family, even though they're not with us anymore, right? Just by the memory of their presence. Just to be clear, the Roarks are still alive. As far as I know, they're in Arkansas. But our congregation's friendship with Nick and Allison and their kids, it's still sweet. The memory of them is a blessing to us. That friendship brings joy. Second reason that friendship is good, first because it brings joy, second, friendship is also good because friendship provides support. Again, Proverbs 27, 9, the sweetness of a friend comes from his earnest counsel, right? Friendship is often where you find the relational support of a kind listener and a wise counselor. Look at the next verse, 27, 10. It says, do not forsake your friend and your father's friend, and do not go to your brother's house in the day of your calamity. Better is a neighbor who is near than a brother who is far away. Right, clearly the verse is suggesting to you, hey, don't neglect to see that your friends who are close to you can help you. Don't always go to your family who's sort of obligated to help you. Remember that if you have friends around, they can help you in the day of your calamity. It sounds a little utilitarian, but it's true, right? Your friends can provide support often. They can help you move. They bring you meals. They can be there for you in the day of calamity. Friendship is good because it brings joy and because it provides support. Third, and maybe most importantly from the perspective of Proverbs, a friendship is important because it can make us wise. Friendship is important because it can make us wise. As we studied through Proverbs 1-9, over and over again, as we listened to the wise father counseling his young son, we saw that the father was very concerned about who his son's friends were, right? As the father talks to his son about the path that he takes. He doesn't just say, take the righteous path. He says, take the path of the righteous ones with them. He doesn't say, just avoid the evil path. He says, avoid the path of evil people. Be careful who you walk with. The father says, well, here's why. Look at Proverbs 13-20, it says, whoever walks with the wise becomes wise. But the companion of fools will suffer harm. You see, when you regularly spend time with other people, when you walk with them, when you do life with them, when you share your heart with them, when you speak to them about what's important to them and about what's important to you, you tend over time to become like them. And that can be bad news, but it can also be really good news, especially if you're a Christian. See, if you're a Christian, then one of your very highest goals in life is to become like Jesus, or as Proverbs would put it, to become wise. And if you've tried that for more than like a week, you realize that it's incredibly difficult to grow in wisdom. It's incredibly difficult to change who you are. Sometimes you want to change, but you feel like you don't have access to the control panel, right? How do I change who I am and what I'm like? Well, it should make our ears perk up when Proverbs tells us that one of the ways that people change is by who they walk with, by intentionally doing life with other people, spending time with them, talking with them about what's important. You see, when you do that with wise people, they tend to rub off on you. So brothers and sisters, if you want to become more like Jesus, one of the best things you can do is to spend intentional time with other people who also want to become more like Jesus. Speak with them on Sundays after the service, right? Seek them out for meals and for fellowship during the week. Meet up with them for prayer and for the study of God's word, the study of a Christian book. Speak with them, even if you can't see them, right? Tell them you're praying for them. Ask them to pray for you. Whoever walks with the wise becomes wise, but the companion of fools will suffer harm. Friendship is also where we're likely to find something else that Proverbs tells us can make us wise, which is advice or counsel. Look at Proverbs 12, 15. 12, 15, it says, the way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but a wise man listens to advice. Several other Proverbs speak about the value of counsel, right? In an abundance of counselors, there is safety, says another verse in Proverbs. I hear that and I think about the council, C-O-U-N-C-I-L, of Elrond and the Lord of the Rings, where there's like 20 people sitting around a circle and the ring is on the table, right? All those counselors, surely they're going to come up with a good plan, right? Well, most of us probably don't have the power to summon a council or a board of counselors every time that we need to make an important decision, right? You can't just snap your fingers and assemble your board of counsel. The way that you're more likely to get advice and counsel is through friendships, right? It is through personal relationships. And again, this is why it's so important to be friends with wise people who know God's word, right? Not all counsel is created equal, right? Seek friendships with people who know God's word and are wise and value their counsel, right? Seek people who are willing to tell you things that you might not want to hear, who might be willing to give you counsel that isn't what you were hoping to receive. In Proverbs 27, 17, it says it like this. It says, iron sharpens iron, and one man sharpens another. The commentator Ray Ortland comments on this verse. He says, by ourselves, we become dull and blunted and lose our edge. Every one of us needs a friend who will not flatter us, but will refine us. A true friend in your life who is making you better by respectful confrontation. A real friend will provoke you and challenge you. You will not agree with everything your friend says, but you will want to listen. We need an honest friend from outside, the tightly knit family to round us out. Why is friendship good? Friendship brings us joy. Friendship can provide support, and friendship has the capacity to help us be wise. Unfortunately that's not the whole picture. In fact, I can guarantee you that none of your friendships will ever be an unmixed package of mutual joy and support and growth and wisdom. We don't live in that world. That's because in a world full of sinners being friends with sinners, friendship can and does go wrong. Second question this morning, how does friendship go wrong? Proverbs is very honest with us about the ways that it can go wrong. Four ways. I think we see first, friendship goes wrong due to our own selfishness. Sometimes we're just too preoccupied with ourselves and our own pursuits even to make friends or to be interested in other people. Proverbs 18.1, it says, whoever isolates himself seeks his own desire. He breaks out against all sound judgment. So to be clear, not all isolation is the result of selfishness, right? Sometimes we're isolated due to our circumstances or the expectations of others on us or what God's called us to do. But sometimes, sometimes we're isolated because we choose to be and because we don't want to love other people enough to seek them out in order to do them good and care about them. Think about Gollum from the Lord of the Rings, right? He's got no friends. Why? Because all he cares about is getting the ring, right? If your life is consumed with your own pursuits, you won't have time or space to make friends. Look at Proverbs 19.6, there's another way that selfishness makes our friendships go awry. Proverbs 19.6, this is another one of those sad but true Proverbs. This is talking about a shallow and defective kind of friendship. It says, many seek the favor of a generous man, and everyone is a friend to a man who gives gifts. My guess is that most of us are probably not faced with the temptation to make friends in order to get money from people. But the point is that friendship can be disingenuous when you're in it primarily to receive rather than to give, right? Friendship gives joy. Friendship provides support. Friendship makes wise. When your entire focus in a relationship is on receiving those things, right, I'm here for you to give me joy and you to give me support and you to give me advice, right? That's often a recipe for unsustainability and breakdown, right, as opposed to mutual love where there's giving and receiving. Look at the second line again of that verse. It says, everyone is a friend to a man who gives gifts. For some of us, our selfishness can look different. Sometimes our strategy is to be the man who gives gifts so that people stay happy with us, right? When you are the man who gives the gifts, who's always pouring in and never opening up or receiving, sometimes that's because what we're really interested in is people liking us and needing us more than in knowing other people and them knowing us, loving other people and them loving us, right? So selfish isolation, selfish neediness, selfish giving, these are not recipes for mutually loving, mutually enriching friendships. Friendships go wrong when we're selfish. Second way, friendships go wrong. Friendships go wrong when we're dishonest. So it can be a temptation sometimes to talk a really big friendship game, right, to talk a big game about how much you love someone and how close of a friend you are to them or how much you want to be. Sometimes in that and in other ways, we can actually kind of be dishonest about the level of friendship that we want to have or the commitment that we want to have to a relationship. Look at Proverbs 20 verse 6. It says, many a man proclaims his own steadfast love, but a faithful man who can find, right? There's a temptation that we would, when we're with people, proclaim our steadfast love to them and then not actually want to show it, right? So if you're not willing to pursue someone for a relationship or you don't want to be pursued by them, don't clearly signal something that isn't true, right? Don't be so worried about proclaiming your steadfast love. Be worried about showing it, about extending it, about being faithful and kind and loving when it's prudent and godly to do that. Friendships can go wrong when we are dishonest. Third, friendships can also go wrong when friendship starts to revolve around sin or when it starts to revolve around foolishness. So C.S. Lewis has pointed out that in romantic love, typically that involves one person facing the other person, so to speak, right? In romantic love, I'm into you, you're into me. C.S. Lewis has said that friendship typically involves two people, metaphorically speaking, facing the same direction side by side, right? Lewis's point is that often friendships happen over something else. Two people are facing the same direction and relating to one another about a third thing, right? About a hobby, for example, or about service, about our love for the Lord Jesus. Friendship involves relating over things, right? That's good, that's right. It's possible for the things over which friendship happens to become foolish or selfish, right? You see this. Sometimes kids, they build friendships around being unkind to other people, right? There's a group of friends, and what does that group of friends do? Well, they're exclusive and they're rude to other people. That's kind of what the group is built on, right? As adults, it can be the case that sometimes our friendships are built on sin and foolishness. Sometimes they're built on gossip, right? Sometimes our friendships are built on sharing information about other people that shouldn't be shared, that isn't edifying to pass around. Look at Proverbs 18.8. It says, the words of a whisperer, or a gossip, are like delicious morsels. They go down into the inner parts of the body. You see what that's saying, right? It's saying that gossip is fun. Gossip tastes like a delicious morsel. In our parlance, we say that gossip can be juicy. It turns out you can build, for a little while, a friend group around gossip, talking to other people in a way that's not godly or loving or profitable, but ultimately doing so is not building unity. It is destructive, and it doesn't honor the Lord. Look at Proverbs 16.28. It says, a dishonest man spreads strife, and a whisperer separates close friends. When you share gossip with someone, it feels like you're cultivating solidarity and intimacy, but zoom out, and what you see is that you are cultivating strife. You're building a friendship on something that doesn't honor the Lord, and you're hurting other people's relationships outside of the group that you're gossiping in. Friendships go wrong when they're built around gossip or materialism or pride or just nothing more than worldliness, right? Listen, it's very good that friends would have fun together. It's good that friends would share hobbies with each other, but brothers and sisters, the goal of our lives is to know and love Jesus Christ, and if our friendships have nothing to do with that, then it seems that they've gone wrong. The fourth and final way that friendship can go wrong, most painfully, I think, friendships can go wrong when they devolve into hostility. We are all sinners, and when sinners are friends with sinners, they sin against each other. And when sin isn't forgiven, when sin isn't either truly overlooked or confronted and then forgiven, then the results can be extremely painful. Look at Proverbs 18, 19. It says, A brother offended is more unyielding than a strong city, and quarreling is like the bars of a castle. Have you ever found someone that you used to be close with utterly closed off to you, like the bars of a castle because of some offense between you? Have you ever found your own heart towards someone else like that, towards someone that you used to trust because of an offense, and now the gates are shut? Friendship goes wrong when it devolves into hostility through unaddressed, unforgiven sin. Friendship is good. There's a lot of ways that friendship can go wrong. So how do we do it wisely? Third final question this morning, how do we do friendship wisely? Five rules, five principles I think Proverbs gives us for doing friendship wisely. First, simply don't isolate yourself. Don't isolate yourself. Look, I get that the terribleness of friendship gone wrong, it can make us want to abstain altogether, right? If really getting close to people means getting hurt, I think I'll just kind of keep my distance. But Proverbs says ultimately that's not wise. Again, Proverbs 18, one, whoever isolates himself seeks his own desire. He breaks out against all sound judgment. The hazards of friendship don't mean that it's not worth the risk. God calls us to pursue friendship and he tells us that ultimately we're better for it. First rule, don't isolate yourself. Second, second principle, second rule to do friendship wisely, show steadfast love. These verses aren't in your bulletin, but if you will turn in your Bible to Proverbs chapter three, verse three, Proverbs chapter three, verse three, the father is speaking to his son and he says, let not steadfast love or sincere kindness and faithfulness or honesty and dependability. Let them not forsake you, bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart. The father says, wherever you go with whomever you interact, let steadfast love, sincere kindness and faithfulness go with you. See, if you're anything like me, you can be tempted as we're thinking together about friendship to be saying to yourself, wow, I need to find someone who will do that for me, right? I need to, I need to find a friend who will do all of these friendship things for me, man. I don't have anyone doing the whole friendship thing for me, right? No one else is being a good friend to me. And there may be a legitimate place to lament that, right? It can be really sad to watch people who give and serve and give and serve and give and serve, not get poured into by, by others, but wearing around your neck. No one is being my friend, right? That's, that's not wise. That doesn't lead to flourishing relationships. Bind steadfast love around your neck, right? Let your goal be to show faithful kindness in relationship and how you engage with others by caring about them. Very, very simply by listening to them, by asking how they are when you interact with them. Steadfast love and faithfulness, that's how God treats his children. Steadfast love and faithfulness are how God wants us to treat one another. And brothers and sisters, Proverbs would urge us in particular to show the steadfast love of friendship to brothers and sisters when they are suffering. Look at Proverbs 17, 17. It says, a friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity. We tend to think about friendship as what you need to have fun. And that's not totally wrong. Friendships are great fun. Saints, what have we thought about friendship as one of the ways that Jesus calls his people to help each other through suffering? Saints, be friends with the lonely. Be friends with those who don't have many other connections. Be friends with those who aren't like you. If we want to do friendship wisely, make it your goal, saints, to show steadfast love. Proverbs 11, 17. It says, a man who is kind benefits himself, but a cruel man hurts himself. Show steadfast love because that's how God has treated you, and that's what he wants you to do. Don't be surprised that that's the best recipe to receive steadfast love as well. Ultimately, it does benefit us. A third principle for doing friendship wisely is be honest. Be honest. As with Proverbs advice about basically everything, this is one of the things that Proverbs just says again and again. Proverbs urges honesty as we pursue friendship, not having zero filter, but humble honesty. Proverbs would urge us to be honest with ourselves and others about how committed we are to a given relationship. Proverbs 25, 14, like clouds and wind without rain is a man who boasts of a gift he does not give. Don't worry so much about talking a big friendship game. Just go be someone's friend. Don't try to give the impression that you're way committed to a relationship if you're not. Be honest. It's okay. You can't be everyone's best friend. If you truly have a best friend, you can have one best friend. Just be honest in the way that you communicate about that. Also be honest in your willingness to confront others. Proverbs 28, 23, it says, whoever rebukes a man will afterward find more favor than he who flatters with the tongue. Proverbs 27, 6, faithful are the wounds of a friend. Profuse are the kisses of an enemy. Faithful are the wounds of a friend. Have you ever been served well by the wounds, like the hurtful stinging words of a friend who loved you? I have. I am so grateful for the friends who have been willing to say things that I didn't want to hear. I am wiser for it. Proverbs commends honesty and our willingness to confront humble honesty, not unfiltered spewing but humble honesty. Proverbs also commends an honest willingness to ask for help. We read Proverbs 27, 9, and 10 already about going to your friend's house in the day of your calamity. If we're going to do this, that means we have to be transparent with our friends that we need help. We have to be willing to open up to our friends about our weaknesses and our difficulties and our need. We need to be willing to ask for prayer. Christian brother, sister, it would be good, it is good that you would have friends with whom you can speak openly and humbly and honestly about your fight with sin. Let me just ruin everyone's secret. This is a church full of sinners who've been forgiven by Jesus. That's the only kind of church there is. Saints, we need friends with whom we can be honest about our struggles and our sins. If friendship is in large part people knowing one another, then how can we ever make progress by hiding who we are and being dishonest, right? Dishonesty never serves the end of building friendship. Fourth principle for doing friendship wisely is be thoughtful. Be thoughtful. Proverbs loves to tell us to be thoughtful about what we're doing. Be thoughtful about how you're coming across to those you're trying to be friends with, right? He says, hey, try not to be oblivious. Proverbs 27, 14, great verse for the Sunday of daylight savings, right? Whoever blesses his neighbor with a loud voice rising early in the morning will be counted as cursing. But Mr. Early Riser, he thinks he's blessing his neighbor, but really he's being annoying, right? All of us are annoying sometimes. Everyone is annoying at times. And all of us sometimes get annoyed when we shouldn't. But sometimes we're annoying needlessly because we're not, we don't take just a second to think about, hey, how is what I'm doing affecting other people? Proverbs is not trying to make you hyper self-conscious, but it does want you to be thoughtful. Be thoughtful about how your actions impact those around you. Be thoughtful rather than oblivious. Be thoughtful, Proverbs would say, rather than presumptuous, right? If we're honest to one another about our needs, that's wonderful. It's good and right. It can be even good and right to ask for help. That doesn't give us an excuse to presume upon other people, right? Look at Proverbs 25, 17. It says, let your foot be seldom in your neighbor's house, lest he have his fill of you and hate you. Right? There's a big difference between humbly asking for help or humbly asking for companionship or for humbly asking for someone to listen to you or for someone's time. There's a big difference between that and being presumptuous, right? Because I have a need, I have a right to what you have. Right? So don't try to apply the sermon this week by going from zero to best friend forever with someone else this week without any regard for whether they want that too. Right? Proverbs calls us to be thoughtful, not hyper self-conscious, but thoughtful in how we engage with each other. The fifth and final rule principle for doing friendship wisely, Proverbs urges us to be forgiving. Listen, there are no friends on earth who are so full of steadfast love and so perfectly thoughtful that they won't sin against you. There are no friends like that. If you truly get close with someone, anyone, and spend enough time with them, your friends will wrong you. Your friends will have unreasonable expectations of you. Your friends will fail to meet your expectations of them. Your friends will fail to be entirely honest with you. Your friends will not show up when you really hoped they would. And you will do all of those things to your friends. And so the only ultimate hope for our friendships is that we learn to forgive each other. Proverbs 10, 12, Proverbs 10, 12. It says, hatred stirs up strife, but love covers all offenses. Love covers all offenses. Love does not wave past offenses in people's faces or plaster them on billboards or build monuments to them. Love covers all offenses. Sometimes love confronts in order to cover. Sometimes love overlooks in order to cover. But at the end of the day, love covers all offenses. If we would do friendship wisely, we must learn to love and forgive, to cover the offenses of others, sometimes by speaking to them humbly and candidly, sometimes by letting it go. Brothers and sisters, this is why ultimately Jesus is the friend you need if you would do friendship well with others. If you want to do friendship with other people well, then ultimately you need Jesus as your friend. So listen, if you're here this morning and you're not a Christian, first, let me say we're delighted that you're here. We're so glad that you've come. You're very welcome. Friend, listen, the claim of the Bible is that however skilled you are at interpersonal relationships, we were created to have a relationship of love and knowledge with the God who made us. And our big problem is not that we're not very skilled in our relationships with one another. That's often true. But that's actually a symptom of our broken relationship with the God who made us. We have, every one of us, sinned against God. We have not shown Him the faithful, steadfast love that we were created to show Him in return for His great kindness to us. And the Bible teaches that if we don't know Jesus, God is actually not our friend. He's our enemy. That's the shocking counter-cultural claim of the Bible. If we don't know Jesus, God is not our friend. He is our enemy. And the proof for that and the reason for that is our own heart's hostility toward Him. We started the fight. But the good news that we gather to celebrate here at Franconia Baptist Church every single week is that God has given His Son, Jesus Christ, to reconcile His enemies to Himself. Jesus lived the life of steadfast love toward God that you and I should have lived. And in obedience to His Father, Jesus died to absorb in Himself the cost of our sin against God, to remove God's wrath against the sins of all who would believe in Him. Three days later, God raised Jesus from the dead and now Jesus promises to forgive and to save everyone who would turn to Him and trust in Him. Listen, there's nothing you need more than the forgiveness and the friendship of Jesus. The Bible says that knowing Jesus is eternal life. It's why we were created. If you want to learn more about that, please don't leave here without speaking to someone, anyone that you've seen up here this morning. On top of that, that's the most important thing. On top of that, listen, if you are a Christian, the resources that you need to be a truly loving and forgiving friend to other people, they come from Jesus' friendship to you. See, Christian, the resources that you need to be a loving and forgiving friend, those resources come from Jesus' friendship to you. This is exactly what we see in the life of the Apostle Paul, whose writing we read in our New Testament reading from 2 Timothy. You see, it seems to me that no one in the history of the church, except for Jesus, did friendship better than Paul. The record of Paul's ministry from the book of Acts and from his own letters, it shows a man pouring himself out in steadfast love for other believers. Paul wept over spiritual backsliders. Paul prayed night and day for the churches he planted and for those he didn't plant. Paul labored in a day before texting to stay in touch with his converts. Paul gave himself radically and sacrificially for the spiritual joy of those to whom he ministered. In his letters, Paul more than once compares himself to a father and to a nursing mother in his tender care for God's people. Paul was a rock star Christian friend. In 2 Timothy chapter 4, the passage that Steve read for us earlier, that's really the end of the last letter that Paul wrote shortly before his death while he was in prison. So Paul was a prisoner in Rome to the Roman Empire, and if anyone had deserved that his friends would show up for him in his hour of trial, it was Paul who had poured himself out for the church. But as Paul sat rotting in prison and waiting to die, when Paul's first court date with Rome rolled around, Paul says this in verse 16, turn with me in the bulletin to the New Testament reading. Look at verse 16. Verse 16, Paul says, at my first defense, no one came to stand by me, but all deserted me. That's so much for Paul's friends. So much for spending his life investing in his friends. What's the next sentence? How does Paul respond to being let down by his friends? Look at what he says. He says, may it not be charged against them. Paul says, hey, even when my friends have failed me, I choose to love them and forgive them. How could Paul do that? Where did Paul have the resources to forgive those who didn't show up for him? Look there in verse 17, he says, but the Lord stood by me and strengthened me. Do you see the logic? No one came to stand by me, all deserted me. May it not be charged against them. How can you do that? Where do you find the strength to do that? The Lord stood by me and strengthened me. Listen, when your friends fail you, the strength to forgive them comes from the Lord who forgives and stands by you. See, if you look to your friends to make you fundamentally okay, then you won't be able to forgive them because their failures of you will totally wreck you. But if you know that you have what you need from the Lord Jesus, then you have what you need to extend love and forgiveness to imperfect sins. See Christian, if you would love and forgive sinful friends like the friends that we all are, we need to press into how wonderfully Jesus has loved and forgiven us. Brother, sister, what kind of friend have we been to Jesus? How little do we look to our relationship with Jesus for joy? How little support do we draw from Jesus' promises? How averse are we to going to Jesus in prayer? How often are we angry with Jesus for the providence that we don't like? How infrequently we give no thought to pleasing Him or to what displeases Him? How often we presume on His patience and His generosity. How ungrateful we are for all we've received from Him. How stuck we get on the selfish things that we want Jesus to do for us and how bitter we get about the just things that Jesus asks us to do for Him. Christian, what kind of friend have you been to Jesus? And yet Christian, what kind of friend has Jesus been to you? This friend has covered all our offenses by His own blood. This friend has loved us enough to confront us rather than let us stray. This friend has stuck closer than a brother. This friend has loved at all times, especially in adversity. Brothers and sisters, I know that not every day of the Christian life feels like this, but have you ever been utterly sad only to find that like Paul, Jesus Christ, your friend, is standing by you to strengthen you? Saints, listen, Jesus is the friend we need if we would love each other well. If Jesus stands by you to strengthen you, you have all you need to be friends with sinners like we are. Brothers and sisters, what a joy to close this morning by worshiping Jesus Christ, the friend of sinners. Jesus, what a friend for sinners. Jesus, lover of my soul. Friends may fail me, foes assail me, He, my Savior, makes me whole. Hallelujah, what a Savior. Hallelujah, what a friend. Saving, helping, keeping, loving. He is with me to the end. Let's pray. Jesus, thank you for the faithful friend that you are to sinners like us. Lord, forgive us for turning aside. Forgive our faithlessness to you and our failure to love one another because we have failed to consider the great love that you have poured out on us. Father, we pray that the friendship, the love, the kindness of Jesus Christ in the gospel would be so sweet to us and that it would strengthen us to love one another well. We ask that you would work this in us through Jesus Christ for His glory. It's in His name that we pray, amen.
