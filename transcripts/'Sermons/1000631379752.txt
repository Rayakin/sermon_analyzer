Our sermon text this morning is Mark chapter 731 to chapter 8 verse 26. Let me read those verses for us and I'll pray once more. Beginning in Mark 731. Then he, that is Jesus, returned from the region of Tyre and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee in the region of the Decapolis. And they brought to him a man who was deaf and had a speech impediment. And they begged him to lay his hands on him. And taking him aside from the crowd privately, he put his fingers into his ears, and after spitting, touched his tongue. And looking up to heaven, he sighed and said to him, Ephphatha, that is, be opened. And his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he spoke plainly. And Jesus charged them to tell no one. But the more he charged them, the more zealously they proclaimed it. And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, He has done all things well. He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak. In those days, when again a great crowd had gathered and they had nothing to eat, he called his disciples to him and said to them, I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with me now three days and have nothing to eat. And if I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way. And some of them have come from far away. And his disciples answered him, How can one feed these people with bread here in this desolate place? And he asked them, How many loaves do you have? They said, Seven. And he directed the crowd to sit down on the ground. And he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people. And they set them before the crowd. And they had a few small fish. And having blessed them, he said that these also should be set before them. And they ate and were satisfied. And they took up the broken pieces left over, seven baskets full. And there were about 4,000 people. And he sent them away. And immediately he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha. The Pharisees came and began to argue with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven to test him. And he sighed deeply in his spirit and said, Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation. And he left them, got into the boat again, and went to the other side. And now they had forgotten to bring bread, and they had only one loaf with them in the boat. And he cautioned them, saying, Watch out! Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod. And they began discussing with one another the fact that they had no bread. And Jesus, aware of this, said to them, Why are you discussing the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened? Having eyes, do you not see? And having ears, do you not hear? And do you not remember? When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up? They said to him, Twelve. And the seven for the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up? And they said to him, Seven. And he said to them, Do you not yet understand? And they came to Bethsaida. And some people brought to him a blind man and begged him to touch him. And he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village. And when he had spit on his eyes and laid his hands on him, he asked him, Do you see anything? And he looked up and said, I see people, but they look like trees walking. Then Jesus laid his hands on his eyes again. And he opened his eyes, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly. And he sent him to his home saying, Do not even enter the village. Please pray with me. God, please open our eyes to see wonderful things from your law. Let your glory in the face of your son Jesus shine in our hearts as your word is proclaimed. Help me as I preach. Help us as we listen. Give us eyes to see and ears to hear by your spirit that we might respond to what you say in faith. We ask all this in Jesus name. Amen. Well, comedy often depends on the failure to understand. Many of our jokes, many comic routines in culture play on one character's inability to understand even when they totally should. So think, for example, of the famous Abbott and Costello skit, Who's on First? It's funny, or at least it was in the 1940s, because no matter how many times the one tells the other, the name of the guy on first base is Who. He is Mr. Who. They can't connect, right? He just doesn't understand. And so it's funny. Or maybe you've seen the famous scene from a movie in which Jim Carrey's character is speaking to his love interest and he wants her to level with him about what his chances are with her. He says, just tell me straight, what are the chances of us getting together? And she says, they're not good. And he says, you mean like one in a hundred? And she says, no, more like one in a million. And then he delivers the famous line, so you're saying there's a chance, right? It's funny because it should be very clear to him what the reality of the situation is, but he persists in failing to understand. He is blind to what's really going on. Well, in our sermon passage this morning, we see another colossal failure to understand, which would be funny if it weren't so tragic. Friends, our passage this morning is a warning to us about the danger that we ourselves might be blind to who we are, to what our lives are about, to our true relationship with God, our creator, and most of all, to the identity and the significance of Jesus Christ. Three points in our service, our sermon this morning. First, the evidence, second, the blindness, and third, the remedy. First, the evidence, second, the blindness, third, the remedy. So first, let's look together at the evidence in this passage. In the first two of the five stories that Mark relates in our passage, Mark continues to pile on evidence that Jesus is the prophesied Messiah. Mark is giving us evidence that he is indeed the Son of God. So the first story in our passage takes place as Jesus travels from Tyre and Sidon down to the region of the Decapolis. So you may remember the Decapolis is a region on the east side of the Sea of Galilee. This is the same region where Jesus cast out the legion of demons from a man back in chapter 5. It's noteworthy that the Decapolis we know from history was populated both by Jews and by Gentiles. Well, after Jesus arrives in the Decapolis, there is brought to him a deaf man with a speech impediment. Those who bring this deaf man to Jesus beg him to heal their friend. Jesus takes the deaf man aside privately, and he performs a strangely physical healing on this man. The text says, he puts his fingers in this deaf man's ears. He spits, probably on his own fingers, and then he touches the disabled man's tongue. It's really hard to know why Jesus does it that way. We know from other miracle stories that Jesus doesn't need to rely on techniques like this in order to heal. It seems that here Jesus is using an especially tactile form of healing to communicate to this deaf man, this healing comes from me to you. My health, my body, my spit is the source of your wellness. Verse 34 tells us that Jesus looks up to heaven, and before he completes this healing, we're told that Jesus sighed. Why does Jesus sigh there in verse 34? It seems that in his compassion, Jesus is mourning this man's deafness. In his compassion, Jesus is grieved by what the effects of sin have done to this man in destroying his healing. Jesus sighs, and then he speaks the first word that this man has heard in a very long time, maybe ever. He says, Ephetha, which Mark tells us means be opened. Mark says, and his ears were opened. His tongue was released, and he spoke plainly. Jesus charges this man, in fact, he charges all those involved not to tell anybody. The motivation for that seems at this point to be crowd control, but Mark says the more that Jesus charged them, the more zealously they proclaimed it. There in verse 37, we see the signature astonishment that often accompanies Jesus' miracles. Look at verse 37, it says, and they were astonished beyond measure, saying, he has done all things well. He makes even the deaf hear and the mute speak. Why does Mark repeat for us exactly what he's just told us has happened? Mark highlights these words to bring to our minds the promise from Isaiah 35 that we heard earlier. What's that all about? Just look in your bulletin with me at the passage from Isaiah 35, which Charles read for us earlier. Isaiah prophesies at the beginning of verse 35, where are we? We're in the wilderness, right? We'll look down at verse 10. Where are we at the end of the passage? We're back in Zion, right? This is a passage about how God brings his exiled people from the wilderness far to him back to himself. Well, what are the signs that in verse 3, God himself has shown up to bring his people back to him? Verses 5 and 6 say that then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, the ears of the deaf unstopped. Then when God comes to bring his people back to himself, then shall the lame man leap like a deer and the tongue of the mute sing for joy. Mark is piling on here the evidence that in Jesus, God has come to bring his people back to himself. Jesus is bringing the new exodus of the people of God that Isaiah has prophesied. Temporarily, Jesus wants to conceal this evidence from those around him. Again, I think mainly for the purpose of crowd control. But very soon, Jesus will command his disciples to proclaim the evidence of his identity and his work to all nations. Mark gives us here evidence that Jesus is the Messiah come to redeem God's people. We see even more evidence of this in the second story that Mark tells us in chapter 8, verses 1 to 10. This story should, if you've been here the past few weeks, sound extremely familiar. Right? Jesus and his disciples are ministering to a large crowd, this time probably a crowd including Gentiles, in a desolate place or literally in the wilderness. Jesus has compassion on the crowd. He wants to feed them. The disciples ask, how are we going to feed this crowd in the wilderness? No one's ever done that, except for us two chapters earlier. Jesus asks them, how many loaves do we have? And they say, well, we have seven. Jesus has everyone sit down. He takes the bread, he blesses it, he breaks it, he gives it to his disciples. He does the same with some fish. Four thousand people eat and are satisfied, and the disciples pick up baskets of leftovers. Remember, three weeks ago, we saw that when Jesus fed not the four thousand mixed Jews and Gentiles probably, but the five thousand Jews back in Mark chapter 6, the point was that Jesus is the divine shepherd come to bring the new exodus. Remember, Mark pointed out to us that through Jesus' miracle, God's people eat bread in the wilderness, just as the children of Israel did. The point is that Jesus is the divine shepherd come again to bring God's people back to himself. So when Jesus miraculously feeds the four thousand, almost certainly in Gentile territory, that's the last locational marker that Mark has given us, this miracle seems to suggest that this new exodus includes the Gentiles. Jesus has come to bring people from all tribes and tongues and languages and nations to himself, to the heavenly Zion. Mark is continuing here to pile on the evidence that Jesus is the Messiah. He is God's son. He is the Savior prophesied in Isaiah. Well, despite the clarity and the abundance of this evidence concerning who Jesus is and what he's come to do, the next two stories in our text reveal astonishing blindness. First point this morning, the evidence. A second point this morning is the blindness. In verse 10, Jesus and his disciples again relocate to somewhere called Dalmanutha. Now, this is one of the very few places in the New Testament of which we actually don't know the location. Most of the places listed in the New Testament, we know where they are through history and archaeology. We actually don't know where Dalmanutha is, but it does seem that Jesus has returned to Jewish territory because the next group that he encounters is the Pharisees. The Pharisees come to Jesus here. By the way, very interesting, the sequence of events that we've had twice now. So in Mark 6 and 7, we had Jesus feed the 5,000. Then Jesus crosses the sea with his disciples. And the very next story is that he's met by the Pharisees and has an argument with them. Well, in this passage, we have Jesus feed the 4,000. Then he and his disciples cross the sea. And the very next thing that happens is the Pharisees show up and they have another conflict. Very interesting. We'll come back to that. Verse 11 says, the Pharisees came to Jesus. The deaf man had come to be healed. The crowd had come for a variety of reasons, probably. The Pharisees, we learn, have come to argue and to seek a sign from heaven, Mark says, to test Jesus. They want a sign from heaven. And maybe they want him to cleanse a man with leprosy or to heal a paralyzed man. Maybe they want him to cast out a bunch of demons. Maybe they want him to miraculously multiply loaves and fish. Maybe they want him to do some sort of public miracle with lots of witnesses that gets written down and is confirmed by those witnesses during their lifetime, which confirmation is strengthened by those witnesses willing to die for what they know that they saw. Maybe that's the kind of evidence that the Pharisees are looking for. Oh, no, wait. That's the evidence that they already have and that they will have as the years wear on. They want something else. They want some sort of additional sign from heaven to verify that all the other signs that Jesus has done are really legit. The Pharisees came, Mark says, to test Jesus. In the Bible, people who test God are often people who say to God, God, I'll dance with you if you'll dance with me, right? If you'll meet my standards, I'll do what you want. But really, you have to comply with my terms, and then I'll believe, then I'll obey. Look there at verse 12, the first half of verse 12. It says, and he sighed deeply in his spirit. We've seen that before. Why does Jesus sigh? Well, the first sigh in this passage is when Jesus is mourning the physical deafness of a man. Now, Jesus sighs deeply in his spirit as he mourns spiritual deafness, or we might say spiritual willful blindness. The Pharisees' refusal to see what is plain before them in the evidence. Friends, beware of willful blindness. Beware of becoming unable to see because you don't want to see. Beware pretending you don't know what the right thing to do is because you're unwilling to do what the right thing is. How does Jesus respond to the willful blindness of the Pharisees, which Jesus suggests is typical of this generation, this unbelieving generation of Israelites in Jesus' day? Jesus says, why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation. Look at verse 13. It says, and he left them, got into the boat again, and went to the other side. Jesus really isn't interested in playing games with the Pharisees. He says, look, there's plenty of evidence, and if you're not going to see it, I'm not going to make you. Friends, this is scary that Jesus would abandon the Pharisees to their willful blindness. Right? Clearly, they don't want to believe, but they don't quite want to be done with Jesus, and so they try to play a game with him. He's like, nope, I'm gone. I'm getting in the boat, going to the other side. Friends, listen. Do we come to Jesus to trust him or to test him? Do we sometimes come to Jesus unwilling to obey unless obedience is what we already wanted to do? Do we refuse to listen to what God says to us unless he tells us what we want to hear, tells us what we already thought? Do we refuse to believe that God loves us until he shows us that he loves us in the way that we want to be shown? Right, friends, if we have struggles, if we have sins, if we have doubts, we are to bring them to Jesus in humble and honest faith. Jesus has enough grace for all of those things, but we must not play games with Jesus. He is not fooled when we pretend. Again, it's shocking and terrifying that Jesus lets the Pharisees remain in their willful blindness. He says, no sign for this generation. He gets in the boat, and he leaves. Well, very sadly, as Mark's narrative continues, we discover that there's some spiritual blindness on the other side of the lake as well. Mark tells us in verse 14 that the disciples brought only one loaf with them in the boat. Matthew's account suggests that this conversation takes place after they've gotten out of the boat on the other side. Jesus tells his disciples in verse 15, he says, watch out. Beware of the leaven, the yeast of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod. Leaven was often used in Judaism in those days as a picture of corruption. And remember what we've already seen about Herod and the Pharisees in Mark's gospel. Herod was, back in chapter 6, a picture of enslavement to sin. Herod indulged his lusts, and they led him around by the nose. The Pharisees, on the other hand, are a picture of hiding sin. They put on a good show. They hide behind moralism and tradition and ritual. They act like they want a sign. Oh, look, they're trying to discern what's true about Jesus. But they're concealing a heart that is far from God, that does not submit to him, that does not love him. You know what Herod and the Pharisees have in common? They both miss who Jesus is. In chapter 6, we read that when Herod heard of the deeds of the Christ, he said, this is John the Baptist. He's been raised from the dead. Right. Herod's guilty conscience obscures his vision of Jesus. He doesn't understand who Jesus is. The Pharisees, their self-righteousness obscures their vision of Jesus. They say, he's doing these miracles by the power of Satan. What do Herod and the Pharisees have in common? One hides their sin. One flaunts their sin. They both miss Jesus. They miss the Messiah. So Jesus tells his disciples, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of Herod. Beware how sin spreads like yeast and infects your ability to see spiritually. Well, how do the disciples respond to Jesus' warning? Well, to put it in theological terms, they don't get it. Verse 16 says, and they began discussing with one another the fact that they had no bread. Right. We imagine Peter saying, Philip, I cannot believe you left all those baskets in Dalmanutha. We don't even know where Dalmanutha is. Right. We laugh, but the sobering truth is that the disciples don't understand. They're not on Jesus' wavelength. They missed the point. And so Jesus challenges their blindness. Look at all the questions that Jesus asks there in verses 17 and 18. He says, why are you discussing the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened? Having eyes, do you not see? Having ears, do you not hear? Jesus is not talking about literal bread. And what should be abundantly clear, even if they missed the metaphor, is that Jesus is not worried about a literal food shortage. Right. A ratio of one loaf to 13 people, that's the best we've had for several chapters. And so Jesus gives them a recent history lesson. He asks, look, when I broke five loaves for 5,000 people, how many extra baskets of bread were there? And they're like, uh, 12. He says, yes, good. How about the seven loaves for the 4,000? They say, well, there were seven baskets of leftover bread after everyone ate and was satisfied. Some people have argued that the 12 baskets in the Jewish miracle and the seven baskets in the likely Jew-Gentile mixed miracle are symbolic. And they've argued that the 12 represent the 12 tribes of Israel and the seven baskets represent either the seven nations that were in Canaan before Israel or the symbolic number of 70 for the number of Gentile nations. That's possible. It's really hard to prove or disprove that that would be in Mark's mind. But this is what's really, really clear. First, Jesus has demonstrated that a bread shortage is no problem. And second, Jesus' bread miracles have revealed who He is. They've shown that He is the divine shepherd who provides bread for His people to eat in the wilderness, who opens the eyes of the blind, unstops the deaf ears, just as God said that He would do when He comes to bring His people to Himself. The disciples don't yet understand who Jesus is, at least not completely. So far in Mark's gospel, the language of blindness, the language of deafness, the language of hardness of heart has actually been reserved for those outside, those not following Jesus mostly. Well, what Mark is showing us is that at this point, even the disciples don't yet completely understand. One Bible scholar puts it this way. He says, repeated exposure to Jesus' teaching and mighty works had not led to reflection on their significance but to a basic insensitivity and dullness. Repeated exposure to Jesus led to a basic insensitivity and dullness. Friends, there is a danger that we who spend a lot of time around the things of the Lord would be led not to reflect on the significance of them and to grasp in its fullness who Jesus is and the significance of His work, but to become instead insensitive and dull to spiritual reality. Right? Like the disciples, we are often consumed in our minds with questions of how are we going to get enough bread? Physical needs, they eat up our physical, our mental rather, bandwidth. That's because we aren't resting in the knowledge of the one who is able to provide. We have, like the disciples, lost sight of Jesus. That's why we're so worried. Oh no, 13 people, one loaf. What are we going to do? We come up against a trial in our lives and we freak out like the God who raised Jesus from the dead is not right there with us in the trial. Friends, can you see from the way that Mark has structured this narrative? What we need, what the disciples need, is not more evidence. Right? Jesus feeds the 5,000, the disciples themselves get the baskets full of leftovers, and then when Jesus comes walking to them on the sea in chapter 6, we read, they did not understand about the loaves. Okay, well maybe, maybe they're just a little slow and they need a second shot. Well, no, Jesus feeds the 4,000, they pick up the extras, and when Jesus warns about the leaven of the Pharisees and of Herod, all they can think is, man, we left the bread in Dalmanutha. Right? The disciples don't have an evidence problem, they have a blindness problem, a deafness problem. According to verse 17, they have a hardness of heart problem. And friends, left to ourselves so often, we do too. We are too easily blinded by our sin, which we're unwilling to forsake, by our self-interest, and by the worldly concerns that eat up our thinking. The message of our passage is that we will not understand, we will remain blind and deaf unless and until we receive the remedy from outside of ourselves. First, we've considered the evidence in this passage. Second, we've considered the blindness. A third point this morning, let's consider the remedy. Did you notice that this passage ends just like it started? Jesus arrives in Bethsaida and there is brought to Him a blind man. As Jesus arrives and those bring Him this blind man, they beg Jesus to heal their friend. Jesus takes the blind man aside privately and He performs a strangely physical healing. He spits on this man's eyes, He lays His hands on him. What a way to communicate to this blind man who can't see. This cure, it's coming from the man who is touching you. My wholeness, my spit, my hands, they will heal your brokenness. Jesus performs step one and He asks this man, do you see anything? The blind man has new vision, but it's very blurry. He says, I see people, but they look like trees walking. Why does Jesus heal this blind man in two steps? You have to come back next week. We'll talk about it next week, Lord willing. In verse 25, we read this second step. Then Jesus laid His hands on His eyes again and He opened His eyes. His sight was restored and He saw everything clearly. After years of blindness, this man now fully healed sees the face of Jesus. Our passage ends as Jesus sends the man straight home, lest the miracle draw yet another crowd. Friends, do you see what Mark is doing and how he structured the narrative? Jesus feeds the 5,000. He crosses the lake. The Pharisees come. They're blind. The disciples too don't get it, but Jesus opens the ears of a deaf man. Jesus feeds the 4,000. He crosses the lake. The Pharisees again are blind. The disciples are too. Then Jesus opens the eyes of a blind man. We read these stories and we think, oh, the Pharisees and the disciples, they're so silly. How could they possibly fail to get it after all that they saw? But these stories are here to show us that we will not understand until Jesus opens our eyes and our ears. That is the main point of this big section of text. We will not understand unless Jesus opens our eyes and our ears. We won't understand what our lives are about. We won't recognize the glory and the identity of Jesus Himself. We won't know the God who made us. We won't perceive our need for His grace. We won't realize that true life is relationship with Jesus unless and until Jesus opens our eyes and our ears. Friends, the good news of this passage is that Jesus is all about opening blind eyes and deaf ears. If you're here this morning and you are not a Christian, let me just first welcome you again. We're so delighted that you've come today. You're very welcome to be here. Friend, I realize this might sound strange to you, but let me tell you how every person in this room who is a Christian became a Christian. Now, in one sense, we all have very different stories. Some of us don't remember a time that we didn't believe in Jesus. Some of us trusted in Jesus when we were very young. Some of us became Christians in college. Some became Christians as adults. Some of us had long periods of studying and thinking and questioning before becoming a Christian. Some of us became Christians almost out of nowhere. But in every case, here's what we believe to have happened to us. We believe that Jesus opened our eyes. We believe that Jesus caused us to see that we are sinners, that God is holy, and that we need his mercy. We believe that Jesus caused us to see that he, his death on the cross, his resurrection from the grave, is what we need to be reconciled to the God who made us. That's actually one of the things that, one of the ways, rather, that we can think about what's going on at the cross as Jesus is dying. Jesus, as he's dying on the cross, is revealing the truth. Now, in one sense, whether or not anyone looks at the cross or understands the cross, Jesus is accomplishing something on the cross. He's doing a deed. At the cross, God is making a transaction with himself, whether or not we realize it. But on top of that, the cross is where Jesus reveals the truth. The cross shows the world, hey world, this is what the wrath of God against sin looks like. World, this is what the judgment of God against our hard-heartedness, our willful blindness, our worldly selfishness, this, this man dying accursed on a cross, this is what judgment looks like. Jesus is also showing the world, world, this is what the love of God looks like. It looks like this. I will die so that you can live. I will be condemned so that you may be pardoned. I will bear judgment, God says to us in Jesus, so that you may receive mercy. Friends, those of us who are Christians became Christians not because we figured it out, not because we're smarter than anyone, not because we're better than anyone, not because we're holier than anyone, but because Jesus opened our eyes. Friend, if you're not a Christian, ask Jesus to open your eyes. Three days after Jesus died, God raised him from the dead and he is alive and at work opening sinners' eyes all over the world. And friend, we have no greater need than for our eyes to be opened to who Jesus is. Let me close with this. Those of us who do know the Lord Jesus, brothers and sisters, we have no greater need than for Jesus to continue to open our eyes and our ears to his glory. We who are Christians have no greater need than for Jesus to continue to open our eyes and our ears to his glory. That's because our growth in obedience, our growth in godly affections, our growth in loving others, our growth in wisdom, our growth in humility, our growth in evangelism, our growth in holiness, all of these things are downstream, so to speak, of our spiritual eyes and ears. We grow as we see Jesus more clearly. In the book of Revelation chapter 1, the author John describes a glorious vision of the risen Lord Jesus that he has. Jesus is walking among seven golden lampstands, which we're told represent the seven churches. Well, in Revelation chapters 2 and 3, Jesus commissions John, who has had this vision, who writes about it in chapter 1, to write to seven different churches in Asia. And in each of these letters, Jesus is calling the churches to a life of faithfulness. He calls them to repentance. He calls them to perseverance. He calls them to obedience. And as Jesus begins each letter, he starts by reminding the churches who he is in the terms of the vision that John has described for us in chapter 1. In other words, before Jesus says to the churches, hey, churches, this is what you need to do, he says to the churches, hey, churches, remember who I am. See me clearly with spiritual eyes. Turn with me for just a moment to Revelation chapter 2. It's the last book of the Bible. Turn all the way to the right. Revelation chapter 2. We'll just look at four of the churches together. Look at Revelation chapter 2 verse 1. There Jesus tells John, to the angel, or the representative of the church in Ephesus, write, the words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks among the seven golden lampstands. Jesus is about to challenge the church of Ephesus to love him. He says that they've abandoned the love that they had at first. But before he calls them to love him, he says, hey, remember, I'm the one who walks among the lampstands. What are the lampstands? They are the churches. Jesus says, before I call you to love me, you need to be reminded that I am the one who is present with you as you gather to worship. You are so precious to me that I hold you in my right hand. Before I call you to the life of obedience, I need to open your spiritual eyes to see who I am, says Jesus. Look at chapter 2 verse 8. Next letter. Jesus says, and to the angel of the church in Smyrna, write the words of the first and the last who died and came to life. You know what's going on in Smyrna? God's people there are being persecuted. Not like people are being mean to them on social media. People are throwing them in prison and killing them. Jesus says to this church later in the letter, he calls them to be faithful unto death. What do they need to see about Jesus before they hear that call? They need to see, verse 8, that he is the one who died and came to life. If you're going to be faithful unto death, you need spiritual eyes to see a Jesus that's bigger than death. Look at chapter 2 verse 12. Next letter. Jesus says, and to the angel of the church in Pergamum, write the words of him who has the sharp two-edged sword. The church in Pergamum is doing great, but there are some who are rebelling against Jesus, teaching immorality. And Jesus reminds him, look, you need to see me as the one who has the sword, the one who has the true power to save or to destroy. Look there in verse 18. Jesus says, and to the angel of the church in Thyatira, write the words of the son of God who has eyes like a flame of fire and whose feet are like burnished bronze. Some in the church of Thyatira are committing sexual immorality. And as Jesus calls them to repent, he says, look at me and see that I have eyes like a flame of fire. I see everything that's going on in my perfect white-hot purity. You need to see me as I call you to repentance, Jesus says. Christian, our big need as we live the Christian life is for Jesus to continue to open our eyes and our ears to his glory. The good news of our passage is that's exactly what Jesus is interested in doing. As we gather Sunday after Sunday around God's word, as we turn our ears to God's Bible day after day, as we gather to speak God's word to one another, our prayer is that Jesus is at work opening our eyes to who he is and thereby changing us into his image. Let's pray that he would do that even now. Please join me in prayer. Father, we thank you for the Lord Jesus' patience with his disciples, for your patience with us as too often our vision is so blurry, so clouded by worldly concerns, Lord so blinded by self-interest. God, I pray that by your Holy Spirit you would open our eyes day after day to see who Jesus is and all that he's done for us, that we might be changed to follow him more faithfully, to love him more dearly. Lord, we ask that you would do these things in us through Jesus Christ for your glory. In his name we pray. Amen.
