Good morning. The sermon text this morning will be the selections from Proverbs that were read earlier. Please join me in prayer briefly just one more time before we look at God's Word together. Lord, let the words of my mouth and the meditations of all of our hearts be pleasing in your sight, O Lord, our rock and our Redeemer. Incline our hearts to your testimonies and not to selfish gain. Be with us to bless us by your Word, through your Spirit, to the glory of your Son, in whose name we pray. Amen. Well, in the Apostle Paul's first letter to his disciple Timothy, Paul writes this. He says, For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs. In James chapter 5 verses 1 to 3, the brother of the Lord Jesus, James, writes these words. He says, Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you. Your riches have rotted and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver have corroded, and their corrosion will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire. Later, he says, you have lived on the earth in luxury and self-indulgence. In Luke chapter 6, the Lord Jesus spoke these words. He said, Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of heaven. And then a few verses later, he says, But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation. Well, many throughout church history have read passages like these and concluded that the Bible takes a fundamentally negative attitude toward money. Wealth has been seen by some throughout church history as an obstacle to the truly spiritual life. Some Christians have taught throughout the ages that if you really want to follow Jesus, some have even insisted that you need to take a vow of poverty. Even today, if you want to become a Jesuit priest in the Roman Catholic Church, you have to take a vow in which you renounce the ownership of all worldly goods. The monastery will let you sort of use certain things on lease, but none of them, or to borrow, but none of them belong to you. That's a very sort of extreme example of this, the Bible is against wealth view. In our Protestant circles, there can also be an unspoken idea that in order to be really godly, you need to be poor. So the false and damnable prosperity gospel, which teaches that God wants his children to be healthy and wealthy and happy all the time throughout this life, rightly that's left a terrible taste in our mouths. But some of us have swung far the other way. We sort of believe that God is most pleased with his people when they don't have money or possessions. I once heard someone describe some church's attitude toward paying pastors will keep him poor and God will keep him humble. I'm deeply, deeply grateful, but that is not at all how Franconia Baptist Church has treated me, to be very clear, very, very clear. But the idea that money is bad can at first seem biblical because of how strongly the Bible warns against the temptation and the misuse of wealth. And make no mistake, we cannot blunt those warnings. There will be people in hell because they loved money instead of God. But it's also important to examine the context of passages like the ones I read a few minutes ago. So Paul in 1st Timothy, his warning against the love of money and the desire to be rich, that can sort of stand on its own and make sense. But James's warning, come now you rich, weep and howl, if you look at the context, it's very clear that he's speaking to a specific group of rich people who got rich by oppressing wage laborers. And if you survey the teaching of Jesus, you cannot honestly conclude that when he says, blessed are you who are poor because yours is the kingdom of heaven, you can't conclude that Jesus is teaching justification by poverty. Jesus' words there do have something to do with where both we spend our resources, how much resources we pursue and how we use them and with the treasure of our hearts. But Jesus clearly isn't teaching that being poor is a prerequisite for going to heaven. You cannot look at the entirety of Jesus' teachings and conclude that. So in fact, if we zoom out and sort of get a whole Bible perspective on the subject of wealth, what we find is that the simple unqualified conclusion, money is bad, doesn't actually do justice to the Bible's teachings. So this morning we are considering what the book of Proverbs has to say about money. And remember the introduction to the book of Proverbs tells us that the book is written in order to teach us wisdom. Proverbs is written to teach us how to live skillfully in the fear of God in this world that he's made. So it's no surprise that we find in Proverbs a lot of material on something as central to our everyday lives as money. So as we study through the text from Proverbs that our sister Deborah read for us earlier, I want us to see two truths that Proverbs wants us to hold in tension. What we find is that being wise with respect to money consists largely in holding two big truths in tension. So that'll be our outline for this morning. And as we look at each of these truths, I want us to tease out some or really see how Proverbs teases out some practical implications of each of these truths. The first truth that we see throughout Proverbs about money is this. Money is good. Money is good. That's pretty simple, but I think that's clearly the presupposition of most of the verses printed in the bulletin for you. Look with me at some of them. Proverbs chapter 10 verse 4. We talked about this verse last week as we thought about work. It says a slack hand causes poverty, but the hand of the diligent makes rich. This verse is clearly meant to incentivize diligence as opposed to laziness. The message of the verse is be diligent. Why? Because diligence leads to riches. And clearly implied in that logic is the premise that riches are good. Look down at chapter 11 verses 24 and 25. Those verses say, one gives freely yet grows all the richer. Another withholds what he should give and only suffers want. Whoever brings blessing will be enriched and one who waters will himself be watered. So these verses address our fear that if I am generous, I won't have enough left over for me. Right? One of these verses say in response to that, they say actually in God's providence as a general truth, not a promise for every circumstance, but in God's providence, generally generosity and prosperity go together. God loves to be generous with those who are generous, right? That doesn't mean that you can sow a seed to someone's ministry and wipe out debt, right? But the general truth is that God loves to be generous with his children as they are generous with others, right? If God runs the world and he sees that you're using wealth in a way that honors him, it would make sense that God's general pattern is to entrust more to that person. That wouldn't be a good thing if being enriched were bad, right? If money were bad, then this proverb would be a warning against generosity, right? Don't be generous or God will smite you with wealth and you certainly don't want that, right? Look down at chapter 18, verse 17. It says, whoever is generous to the poor lends to the Lord and he will repay him for his deed, right? We would want to add that the repayment for the generosity of God's people is ultimately when the Lord Jesus comes back, right? Jesus is clear that ultimately the reward for all of our service to him, including our giving, which doesn't earn us anything before God, ultimately our reward will come when we stand before him on the day when we as forgiven sinners are about to enter the new heavens and the new earth and he generously, lavishly, graciously rewards the imperfect faithfulness of his children. That is ultimately when the faithfulness of God's people comes to be repaid. But notice again, the clear implication is that generosity here is good, right? And generosity wouldn't be good if money itself were bad, right? If money were like spiritual anthrax, then when you got it, you should burn it. You shouldn't pawn it off on someone else if it's evil, right? Last example here, chapter 13, verse 22. It says, a good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children, but the sinner's wealth is laid up for the righteous. Again, these are general truths. They're not universal spiritual laws, but the general truth is not that every single godly person must die penniless, right? A monetary inheritance can be a blessing from the perspective of Proverbs. So the first truth that Proverbs teaches us about money is that money is good. Having and using money is ordinarily part of living wisely in God's world. I think if we zoom out just a little bit and get kind of a whole Bible perspective, it makes sense that money is good because we are created in the image of a God who owns stuff. If you've got your bulletin, turn back to the third page with me of the bulletin where we looked at the scriptural call to worship from 1 Chronicles 29, verse 11. 1 Chronicles 29, verse 11, David is praising the Lord here, and he says, yours, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty. Why? For all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Right? David is saying that one of the manifestations of God's glory is that he owns everything because he made it. By the way, you think you own stuff? You do own stuff. But ultimately, God owns all your stuff. In fact, you have it as a stewardship from him to use in a way that's pleasing to him. God reveals his glory by using stuff that he's made to accomplish his good purposes. God sovereignly disposes of all of the stuff in heaven and on earth to glorify his name and ultimately to do good to his people. So, friends, because we're made in the image of that God, it is good, it is dignifying that we are able to own and to use stuff, money, for God glorifying purposes. So, Marxism is a political philosophy. Really, it's a worldview that's very influential in our day. And Marxism advocates for the abolition of private property. So, Marxism teaches that people's ability to own wealth, and people's ability particularly to own wealth that can make them more wealth, they say that that ability necessarily involves us in an oppressive system of class warfare. So, Marxism advocates, ultimately, we want sort of a state that's going to disappear that owns everything and sort of makes everyone share. We need to abolish private property. The Bible says that's ridiculous. God owns stuff, and he created us to be able to own stuff like he does and to use that stuff for his glory. Christian, think about the things that you did this past month that were just unambiguously good, right? Anything that you did this past month that clearly glorified God. Serving in a God-honoring job, right? Feeding and clothing and raising and keeping alive your children, right? Communicating with other people, maybe via a phone or an email or texting. Sharing a meal with someone else, right? Reading a soul-nourishing book. Owning a copy of the Bible and reading that, right? Stuff and money, on some level, are involved in accomplishing all of those things. I wrote this sermon on a laptop that cost money. I drove here in my beautiful 2008 missing hubcaps cracked in the windshield Toyota Yaris, right? We were blessed this morning because David Link owns a guitar and because someone paid for him to have music lessons at some point, right? So just as it's good that God owns stuff, we can certainly do it wrong. We can certainly turn it into an idol, and that's terrible, but our capacity to own stuff is good, right? In one sense, money is good. Before we move on, I want us to see three practical implications of this big truth that Proverbs draws out for us. So first, Proverbs calls us to be diligent with our money. First practical implication that money is good. Proverbs calls us to be diligent with our money. Again, look at Proverbs 10.4. The second line says the hand of the diligent makes rich, right? There are things that we need to say, and we'll say in a minute, that need to qualify this statement, but Proverbs would tell us it's not wrong to work hard to earn well, right? That's not the fundamental reason to work hard, and it matters very much why we want to earn well and what we intend to do with what we earn, but profit can be part of a godly motive for hard work, for diligence. Another verse we spoke about last week, Proverbs 21 verse 5, it says the plans of the diligent, plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance. Now look at the very last passage in the bulletin, Proverbs 27, 23 to 27. This is spoken in an agrarian society. It says, know well the condition of your flocks. Know well, pay attention to the condition of your flocks, and give attention to your herds. For riches do not last forever, and does a crown endure to all generations? When the grass is gone and the new growth appears, and the vegetation of the mountains is gathered, the lambs will provide your clothing and the goats the price of a field. There will be enough goat's milk for your food, for the food of your household, and maintenance for your girls, probably milkmaids there. There's a lot in those verses, but for our purposes, the point seems to be, keep an eye on your assets. Know well the condition of your flocks. That's wise, right? It's not unspiritual to manage money with an eye to the future. Proverbs tells you to do that. It's wise and godly to know your financial position and to plan prudently. The first implication, we're to be diligent with our money. The second implication of this truth is that Proverbs calls us to be self-controlled with our money. The Bible does commend that we enjoy good things that God gives us, but Proverbs in particular kind of puts a check on our lack of self-control in using our money just for things that we enjoy. So look at Proverbs 21 verse 17. It's in the bulletin. It says, whoever loves pleasure will be a poor man. He who loves wine and oil, sort of the luxury party items in that day, will not be rich. So I remember when I was a kid between the ages of probably roughly 8 and 15, whenever my family would go out for a meal at a restaurant, which was not terribly often, my parents would often say, all right guys, soft drinks at this restaurant, even though the meal's like $10, soft drinks are $3 a person, right? And you can have a Coke at home for like 30 cents. So we are going to drink water in order to save money. So my parents are probably possibly the most generous people I know, and I don't have complete knowledge of sort of their financial state as I was growing up, but I don't think it would have broken the bank for us to have had a couple of Cokes. But my parents were teaching us that self-control is a part of faithful stewardship, right? Money is good, and it's good for other purposes than purchasing stuff that gives us pleasure. So an imbalanced focus on the fun and the tasty and the comfortable and the entertainment, at some point an imbalanced focus on that can become unwise. It can lead to poverty, says Proverbs, right? I want doesn't equal I need. I want does not imply I have the means to get. I want doesn't imply this is a wise purchase. And again, there's certainly a time to spend and enjoy. There are other passages of the Bible that address that, and I am not trying to bind anyone's conscience with respect to their drink choices this afternoon. If you want a soda to the glory of God and you can afford it, you do it. All the youth are like, no, you ruined Coke. But the point is that Proverbs encourages us to exercise self-control in our spending. Money is good, therefore use self-control. Third implication of Proverbs teaching that money is good. Proverbs urges us to be generous. Yes, be generous. These two verses aren't in the bulletin, but remember we looked at them back in, I think, December when we studied through Proverbs chapter 3, Proverbs 3 verses 9 and 10. It says, honor the Lord with or literally from your wealth and from the first fruits of all your produce. Then your barns will be filled with plenty and your vats will be bursting with wine. Honor the Lord from your wealth. Look at Proverbs 14.21 in the bulletin. It says, whoever despises his neighbor is a sinner, but blessed is he who is generous to the poor. Proverbs 13, I'm sorry, 14.31, just below that in the bulletin. Whoever oppresses a poor man insults his maker, but he who is generous to the needy honors him. If money is good, and the greatest commandment is to love God supremely, immeasurably more than our money and our neighbor as ourselves, then it is good to give money to causes that honor God, to bless others. It can even be good to give money to others who are in need. And so what does that look like in today's world? What does that look like? Well, just really briefly, this is not an exhaustive treatment, but five ways this could look, this can look. The first way, believers, giving to your local church and other ministries and missionaries to support the spread of the gospel so that others might have the eternal and supreme treasure of Jesus Christ. That's a clear way to honor the Lord from your wealth. The second way this can look, giving perhaps anonymously to people you know who have pressing financial needs. You don't have to be able to get a tax deduction in order for your gift to honor the Lord to someone. And number three, giving to organizations that meet human needs and spread the gospel, both locally, but maybe even especially in other countries, right? In our New Testament reading, we read about churches in Corinth, a wealthy city, giving to relieve saints in Jerusalem who were poorer. When you sort of zoom out and look at human history and the state of the world economy today, it's hard to escape the conclusion that it could be good that we who are in basically the wealthiest society ever would send money outside of that society, potentially to help other Christians elsewhere, especially who are suffering. So praise God, many in the church gave to the Baby Bottle Boomerang Assist Pregnancy Fundraiser a few weeks ago. Those funds ultimately go to support needy pregnant mothers who choose life in this area. Other examples of this might be giving to Samaritan's Purse or Barnabas Aid or Compassion International or the Turkey Relief Fund in light of the recent earthquakes that was sent out through the church office so that our brother Andy Johnson can help believers in Turkey and Syria who are suffering because of the earthquakes and meet their practical needs and serve their neighbors. A fourth way that this could look is practicing hospitality to bless and refresh others. Right? Hospitality doesn't need to be expensive to honor God, but I'm definitely a happier and holier Christian because of the other Christians who have had me into their home and paid for me to eat some kind of food while I was there. A fifth way that this can look is investigate investigate the best way to help the needy. Right? This is something I want to spend more time on figuring out as one of our pastors. It seems to be the consensus of wise and godly people who have studied this issue that the best way to help the poor, both here and elsewhere, isn't really simple. It's probably not the best way to help the poor just to take a big chunk of your savings and start giving it to panhandlers. Right? But what's very clear is that indifference to the poor, indifference to the needs of the poor generally, is wrong. It's a God-honoring use of our time to think, to investigate, to figure out what it looks like to love and serve our neighbors by being generous. That's something I'd love for us to be thinking and praying about. So maybe the application of the sermon for us today is to pray for wisdom about how God would have us be generous. That sounds like a prayer he would love to answer. Maybe it's to pray for wisdom about how God would call us as a church to continue to be generous. This is the first foundational assumption from Proverbs about money is that money is good. Therefore, it calls us to be diligent and to use self-control and to be generous with it, not only to enjoy it, although God does give it to us for that gracious purpose as well. The second foundational truth that we see about money in Proverbs is that money is not the ultimate good. Money is not the ultimate good. Proverbs takes pains to make this point in a variety of ways, probably because the Lord knows that we are prone to get this wrong. Right? You might remember when we looked at Proverbs 8 together a few weeks ago, we pointed out that no less than four times Proverbs asserts to us that wisdom is more precious than gold. Becoming the kind of person who fears God and walks wisely before him, it's worth so much more than lots and lots and lots of money. Look at Proverbs 15, 16, and 17 there on the second page of the scriptures printed in the bulletin. Money is not the ultimate good. Proverbs 15, 16, and 17 says, better is a little with the fear of the Lord than great treasure and trouble with it. It is better as a dinner of herbs where love is than a fattened ox and hatred with it. Another similar verse not in the bulletin, Proverbs 17, 1 it says, better is a dry morsel with quiet than a house full of feasting with strife. The pursuit of wealth is not worth turning a home into a place of strife. Money is good, said Proverbs. Get this, loving relationships beat money for quality of life. That's the practical wisdom of Proverbs. Money is not the ultimate good. Much of Proverbs' wise advice about money really amounts to a warning not to view money as ultimately valuable in a variety of ways and spheres. I think Proverbs really warns us against four errors that we're tempted to make it as we are tempted to treat money as ultimately valuable. So first error, when we overvalue money we're tempted to mistreat others. Proverbs 18, 23 there, it says, the poor use entreaties but the rich answer roughly. The poor use entreaties but the rich answer roughly. And how do you treat people in occupations that make less money than you do maybe at the store elsewhere? There's a temptation to connect our estimation of people's worth to the amount of money that they appear to have. There's a temptation if we have more to see ourselves as superior to those who have less. And there's a temptation to fail to be kind because we're to be kind because of that. So brothers and sisters, do we treat well-dressed, refined people whose wealth helps them seem put together differently than you treat those whose appearance might suggest that they have less? Proverbs 14, 20 it says, the poor is disliked even by his neighbor but the rich has many friends. That's not a good truth. Proverbs is reflecting on the fact that this is true and sad, true and wrong. Friends, because our hearts tend to turn money into an ultimate thing, there's a temptation that we would refuse to invest in relationship with others because they don't have the money for our hobbies or for our lifestyle or for the nice comfy home with the quality food. There's a temptation to gravitate toward the people with the resources so that you can join in their fun instead of loving your neighbor as yourself regardless of what he has. The passage that I read at the beginning of the service from James 5, when James says, come now you rich, weep and howl, the context makes very clear that James is talking to people who got rich by oppressing wage laborers. This doesn't seem to be a temptation for most of us, but just to say that that's why it's good and needful that countries have just labor laws. It's good that there's pressure on big businesses to be transparent about their workers' labor conditions, especially in other countries. Cheaper goods are not worth horrid and immorally bad sweatshops. I understand that the global economy is complicated, but it's never right to oppress for the sake of profit. Proverbs urges us not to make wealth ultimate in how we treat other people. Second, when we make money the ultimate good, we err in how we try to appear. There's a famous economist whose name is Thorstein Veblen, which is one of the coolest names ever. And he wrote about 100 years ago, I believe, about conspicuous consumption, which is a fancy word for keeping up with the Joneses. And Proverbs beat Thorstein Veblen to it, right? Look at Proverbs 13.7. It's not in the bulletin. Just listen as I read it. It says, one pretends to be rich, yet has nothing. Another pretends to be poor, yet has great wealth. Proverbs doesn't seem to be commending that practice. Proverbs 12 verse 9, it says, better to be lowly and have a servant. Don't think slave there. Think enough money to employ someone. Better to be lowly and have a servant than to play the great man and lack bread. There's a temptation, Proverbs says, that we would go to great lengths to seem like we have a certain amount of money. To have the phone or the home or the car or the clothes or the shoes, not the ones that serve us well so that we can love God and others, but the ones that communicate status to others. And Proverbs reminds us that's not wise. Because what matters most is your status before God. And what matters more than how much you seem to have is how much you do have and how you're using it to God's glory. Second, or third rather, error that Proverbs warns us against when we overvalue money is in how we spend ourselves, how we spend our lives. Look at the second to last passage in the bulletin, Proverbs 23 verses 4 and 5. So, on balance, Proverbs exhorts us to diligence and to hard work, but these verses are a needed pullback to those exhortations. They say, do not toil, notice that word, do not toil to acquire wealth. Be discerning enough to desist. When your eyes light on it, it is gone. For suddenly it sprouts wings flying like an eagle toward heaven. That word for toil there in the first verse, it's not the usual word that Proverbs uses for work. Last week, the verse on the front of the bulletin said, in all toil there is profit, right? That's just referring to hard work. Here, the word toil refers to making yourself completely worn out, spending yourself utterly and entirely. Money is good, so be diligent. Money is not ultimately good, so don't wear yourself out in pursuit of it. Don't so wear yourself out that you have no gas in the tank to spend time with the Lord, that you have no gas in the tank to love your family, that you have no gas in the tank to love and serve your neighbor and your church and to enjoy what God has given you, right? If you're laboring for the day that you have enough money, this proverb says to you, you will never rest. You will forever find your wealth flying away like an eagle, says this Proverbs. But if you're laboring in obedience to the God whom you trust to provide your daily bread, yes, you will work hard, but this proverb says, you'll be discerning enough to desist. That leads us to the fourth and I think most important way that we err when we make money our ultimate good, that we err in where we put our trust. Look at Proverbs 18 verses 10 and 11. These are the most important verses that we'll read this morning. Proverbs 18, 10, and 11. Look at verse 10. It says, the name of the Lord or the character of the Lord, who he is and how he deals with his children. The name of the Lord is a strong tower. The righteous runs into it and is safe. Friends, why are the righteous, those who trust in the Lord, safe? Because the name of God, the character of God keeps them safe. The apostle Paul, toward the end of his life, writing in 2 Timothy about how he was conscious that the Lord stood by him and strengthened him in his hour of trial. He's in prison for all intents and purposes. He is destitute. He wrote shortly before he was killed, he said, the Lord will rescue me from every evil deed and bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom. Paul was killed, but from God's perspective, Paul was safe. Listen, Paul is safe. Where is Paul now? He did not disappear from existence. Paul is with Jesus right now. And for almost 2,000 years, he has been happier than any of us. He is safe with Jesus. Right? Saints, we serve a God who is with us in all of our difficulties, who has promised to give us and to be for us all that we need. He has promised that we are safe because of his name, because of his character, because of his love for us. I've read before in our services the first question and answer of the Heidelberg Catechism. Lord willing, if the Lord Jesus tarries and gives me time in this church, Lord willing, you'll hear me read them again. Right? The first question and answer of the Heidelberg Catechism. What is your only comfort in life and in death? Here's the answer, that I am not my own, but belong body and soul to my faithful Savior, Jesus Christ. He has fully paid for all my sins with his precious blood and has set me free from all the power of the devil. He also preserves me in such a way that without the will of my heavenly Father, not a hair can fall from my head. Indeed, all things must work together for my salvation. Therefore, by his Holy Spirit, he also assures me of eternal life and makes me heartily willing and ready from now on to live for him. The name of the Lord is a strong tower. The righteous man runs into it and is safe. What does the next verse say? Verse 11. It says, a rich man's wealth is his strong city and like a high wall in his imagination. Friends, listen, the reason that although money is good, that it is unbelievably eternally dangerous is because it threatens to rewrite the catechism of our hearts like this. What is your only comfort in life and in death? Answer, that I live in 21st century America as a well-connected person of means who will very likely have enough money to buy tasty food and nice clothing and a comfy home and good medical care for the rest of my life. Friends, where is your trust? What is your heart's strong tower? Where is the assurance that you are going to be okay coming from? The Lord or our wealth? Listen, there is such a danger that on the last day we find that we spend our lives not serving and loving and following and trusting the Lord Jesus, but chasing and spending money to keep our lives comfortable. A rich man's wealth is his strong city and like a high wall in his imagination. Money pretends to be a strong city, but it's imaginary. Money cannot guarantee you good health and safety and happiness in this life. Wealth now cannot guarantee that you will have wealth later. Money certainly cannot buy you the peace of God that surpasses all understanding. Money cannot buy you the ways of pleasantness and the paths of peace that Proverbs says come to those who fear the Lord. Money cannot buy you a clean conscience. Money cannot buy you communion with the God who made you. Money cannot buy you the words of Jesus on the last day, well done good and faithful servant. Money cannot buy your way out from under God's wrath against sin. Proverbs 11 verse 4, the second verse on the bulletin, last one I'll mention, it says riches do not profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from death. Friend, listen, if you're here this morning and you're not a Christian, the first thing I want to say to you is we are delighted that you have come this morning. We hope you feel very welcome. The second thing I want to say to you is we do not want your money. If you are here this morning and you do not know Jesus, do not give us money. We do not want it. Here is what we want for you, not from you, but for you. We want you to know about the righteousness that can deliver from death. Listen, the Bible teaches that our greatest problem is that whether it's money or family or pleasure or relationship or status or health, we have all treated created things instead of the creator like our strong tower, like our high wall, like the thing that is ultimately going to make us okay. And the Bible says that's deeply offensive to the God who made us to love him with all that we are. The Bible compares it to a spouse delighting and resting in the love of someone else rather than his or her spouse. The Bible teaches that our sin against God has therefore alienated us from God and introduced hostility between us, hostility that will culminate in the day when Jesus comes back to judge the world in judgment, in condemnation. But the good news of the gospel that we gather to celebrate every Sunday is that in his mercy, God gave his son, Jesus Christ, the supreme treasure to save us from that condemnation by dying on the cross as a substitute. This is how Paul described it in our New Testament reading. He says, for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, that you by his poverty might become rich. Jesus possessed the riches of a righteous standing before God, the glory and honor and comforts that were due him in heaven. But Jesus didn't honor those riches as ultimate good. In fact, he gave them up so that he could have you. Jesus took on himself the poverty of our sin and condemnation before God so that we, by that poverty, might become rich with his own righteousness, that his moral record of loving and trusting God as his strong tower might be credited to sinners like us who trust in him. Friend, there's only one righteousness. There's only one record of moral goodness that can save from eternal death, and it's not the righteousness of our respectable lives. It's not the righteousness of our financial generosity. It's the righteousness of Jesus Christ who died and rose to save sinners. It's the righteousness that God will give you for free if you will trust in him. If you'd like to learn more about that, please don't leave today without talking to one of our members. Anyone you've seen up here, anyone who's a member of the church to me, please don't leave here without talking to someone about how you can have that righteousness. Riches do not profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness, the righteousness of Jesus Christ delivers from death. What wonderful news. Brothers and sisters, when we are generous, when we decide that loving other people is worth more than holding on to what we have, we are only imitating the Lord Jesus Christ who for our sake became poor so that we by his poverty might become rich. Money is good. Praise God for the money that he's given you. Money is not ultimately good. Jesus Christ, having him, knowing him is ultimately good. He is the strong tower in whom we can take refuge throughout our lives and in eternity who has promised to be for us all that we need. Saints, let's pray he would teach us to trust him and to be wise with what he's given us. Let's pray. Father, we confess that your son Jesus is the supreme treasure, but he who is rich beyond all measure, he who is most glorious and the creator of all things. We marvel that he became poor for us, that he was condemned, that we might be forgiven. Would we confess to you the ways that we have treasured other things? Would you forgive us? Would you teach us to run to your name, to your character, to the love displayed toward us in Jesus as our strong tower? And God, would you teach us to be wise, wise stewards of your stuff that you've given us to own? Thank you for it. Lord, would it only ever be for us a gift and a tool and a blessing and never a God. Lord, work this in us through Jesus Christ by your spirit, we pray. Amen.
