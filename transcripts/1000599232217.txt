Beth fyddech chi'n dweud yw'r broblem mwyaf i'r Christianiaeth? Llywodraethau ddiwylliannol? Ymgynghoriad secwilol? Y cyfryngau cyhoeddiol? Eraill o ddynion? Critigwyr ateistig? Beth fyddech chi'n dweud yw'r gosgol yn cael ei hysbysu'n fwy? Nid yw'n anodd i ddweud ymgynghoriadau'r gosgol, nid yw? Fodd bynnag, dywedodd Diwd eisiau cydnabod dynion sy'n amlwg, anadlwg, ymddangos. Mewn gwirionedd, efallai yw hyn yn y gweithgaredd mwyaf i'r gosgol. Felly, dros y ddwy wythnos nesaf, byddwn ni'n clywed o Diwd. Mae'n llythyr iawn, dim ond 25 o ffyrdd, ond mae'n cael ymgynghoriad. Felly, pwy yw Diwd? Byddwn ni'n edrych yn ôl ar y gwaith un. Mae Diwd yn cyflwyno'i hunain fel gweithgareddwyr i Jesus Christus a brwydr i James. Nawr, mae hyn yn ddiddorol iawn, oherwydd yw James Mary a Joseph's son, y brwydr i Jesus. Mae hyn yn gwneud Diwd y brwydr i Jesus. Nawr, os oeddwn i Diwd, byddwn i'n ymwneud â'r detail honno. Byddwn i'n chwarae'n anhygoel fy mhrwyr i Jesus Cod. Yn ôl i'r holl beth, byddai hyn yn rhoi rhyw ddiddorol iawn i'w. Ond yn ystod hyn, byddai Diwd yn ei gyflawni fel gweithgareddwyr i Jesus. Mae'r gweithgaredd Grec yno'n dulos, sy'n gallu cael ei ddarllen fel gweithgareddwyr hefyd. Yn y diwedd o'r fers 4, mae'n ei ddweud bod Jesus yn ein unig arwain a Llywodraeth. Nawr, ddim i'r holl beth ddiddorol yw hyn. Yn y diwedd o'n gwasanaeth, bydd Nathaniel Clarke yn cael ei ysgrifennu. A phan fyddwn ni'n ei ysgrifennu, byddwn i'n rhannu'r adroddiad o'r ffordd y dywedodd ei fod yn Christian. Felly, dywedodd Nathaniel Clarke ei ysgrifennu fel hyn. Hei, fy enw i yw Nathaniel. Y gweithgaredd William. Fy unig arwain a Llywodraeth. Nawr, rwy'n siŵr y bydd William yn hoffi hynny. Ond byddai'n anodd, oherwydd dydw i ddim yn gwybod amdani. Ond dydw i ddim yn gwybod amdani, mae fy ngwyrwyr yn y diwrnod diwethaf a byddai'n gofyn i mi fod yn arwain a Llywodraeth. Nid yw unrhyw un yn ystyried eu hunain fel ysgrifennu o'u gwyrwyr. Dyma oherwydd mae'r gwyrwyr'n gweld eich gweithgaredd mwyaf o'u gilydd, dydyn nhw ddim? Maen nhw'n gweld y temper tantrwmau, y ddiddorol, y gweithgareddau. Os oes unrhyw un yn gwybod eich bod yn ddiweddar, mae'n eich gwyrwyr. Ond pan edrychodd Jude ar ei bwrwyr, roedd e'n gweld rhywun yn unig, glorius, ddiffin. Nawr, nid yw Jude bob amser wedi gweld Jesus yn y ffordd hon. Felly, yn John 7, 5, rydym yn cael ei ddweud nad oedd eich brwyrwyr Jesus hefyd yn credu iddyn nhw. Yn ddiweddar, ar ôl i'w ddiddorol ddod o'i gilydd, fel bod Jesus wedi'i hannog ar y croes Roman. Felly, beth allai wedi rhoi ymlaen at y newid hyfryd hwnnw? Wel, oherwydd nad oedd Jesus wedi dod o'i gilydd. Roedd e'n dod o'r gofod yn gyfrif dros ddiddorol a'r myneg. Ac roedd e'n dod i hundred o bobl, gan gynnwys ei brwyrwyr. A'r unig y gallant ddod o'i gilydd yw bod Jesus, eu brwyrwyr, ddim yn unig person. Roedd e'n Ddewd yn y fles. Ac felly dyna pam mae Ddewd yn agor ei lyfr gyda phobl hyfforddiol. Nid yw e'n ddod o'i gilydd i fod yn brwyrwyr Jesus. Yn llawer o ffyrdd, roedd Ddewd yn unig fel pob aelod o'r croes. Roedd e'n ddewd o'r croes. Felly, pan yw Ddewd yn ymwneud â hynny? Wel, yn unol i rai llyfrau Newydd, nid yw Ddewd yn ymwneud â chyrch arbenigol. Yn aml, mae'n deimlo ei fod yn ysgrifennu i'r holl ysgolion. Yn benodol, mae'n ysgrifennu i'r rhai sy'n cael eu hysgrifennu yno, yn ystod un. Dyna'r rhai sydd wedi cael eu hyfforddi drwy'r gosgol. Mae'r rhai sydd wedi cael eu hysgrifennu allan o'r ddechrau i'r llyfr marfolaethol. Mae'r rhai sydd wedi cael eu hysgrifennu i'r gilydd gyda'r Dewd, y Llywodraeth Jesus. Yn anffodus, mae Ddewd yn ysgrifennu i'r myfyrwyr. Dyma'r bobl sydd wedi cael eu hysgrifennu i'r Dewd, y Llywodraeth Jesus. Roeddwn i'n ddynion dynol, ond mae Dewd wedi cwrdd â ni i fod yn rhan o'i teulu. Mae'n ei adnabod ni fel myfyrwyr. Felly, pan oedd Jesus yn cael ei hysgrifennu, a oeddech chi'n cofio'r Dewd yn siarad y dylai ysgrifennu i'r Dewd yn Mathew 3.17? Ac roedd e'n dweud, Dyma fy myfyrwyr, gyda'r rhai rwy'n hoffi'n dda. Os ydych chi'n credu mewn Christus, mae'r statws yr oedd Jesus yn ei gael cyn y Dewd yn eich hun. Os ydych chi mewn Christus, dyma chi. Dyma eich eidentydd mwyaf ddiogel. Dyma'r sylfaen anhygoel sy'n ymwneud â'ch bywyd cyfan. Rydych chi'n myfyrwyr yn Dewd y Dewd. Yn ddiweddar, mae Dewd yn ysgrifennu i'r rhai sy'n cael eu gobeithio am Jesus Christus. Mae'r sylfaen o fod yn cael ei gobeithio yn sylfaenol i'r llyfr Dewd. Byddwn ni'n mynd i feddwl mwy am y sylfaen hon ym mis nesaf. Ond, o'r dechrau, mae Dewd eisiau cymryd sylfaen i'w myfyrwyr. Mae'r rhai sy'n cael eu gobeithio ac yn cael eu hoffi gan y Dewd yn cael eu gobeithio i'r diwedd. Dyma'r caniatêd sydd i chi. Dyma sut mae'n anodd i chi os ydych yn Christus. Ond pam mae Dewd yn ysgrifennu? Wel, dywedwn ni y sgwrs ar hynny yn y ddiflwyr 3 a 4. Mae'r ddeunydd cyntaf sydd wedi cael ei ddweud am y llyfrau hwn yw nad oedd Dewd eisiau ei ysgrifennu. Eisiau bywyn. Mae'n dweud, rydw i eisiau ysgrifennu i chi am ein hafodol ddiogel. Mae'n ymddangos bod Dewd eisiau ysgrifennu llyfrau mwy hyfforddiol. Efallai y byddwn ni eisiau ysgrifennu'r gloriau o waith Christus. Efallai y byddwn ni eisiau ysgrifennu'n fwyaf i'r beth mae'n golygu ei fod yn cael ei ddweud, yn cael ei hoffi a'i gadw. Ond mae'n dweud ei fod yn anodd ysgrifennu llyfrau gwahanol. Mae'n ymddangos fel ysgrifennwyr sy'n gweld llyfr. Mae Dewd yn teimlo'r amgylchedd ysgrifennol. Mae'n dweud yno, rydw i wedi teimlo ei bod yn anodd ysgrifennu i chi. I ymddangos i'r feddwl. Mae'r gwaith Greg yno yw ein bod ni'n dechrau ein gwaith agoniadu. Mae'n golygu ysgrifennu, ysgrifennu, ysgrifennu gyda'n holl energiaeth. Mae hyn yn golygu ysgrifennu. Mae Dewd yn dweud, dynnu eich glofiau'r bocs, rhannu'r gwynt, dyna'r amser i'w gysylltu. Yn benodol, mae Dewd eisiau ein hadlu am y feddwl. Mae'r feddwl yno'n ymddygiad Christian. Yr wythnos am ddod yn ôl yn Iwerddon. Y gwybodaeth da y mae Iwerddon yn amlwg yn amlwg, y gosgol. Dyna'r hyn y mae Dewd yn siarad amdano. Mae'r ymddygiad yma, y gosgol, yn dweud, yn cael ei ddod yn ôl yn Iwerddon i'r aelodau. Nawr, mae'r gwybodaeth yma yn agos, os ydych chi'n meddwl amdano. Maen nhw'n dweud wrthym nad oedd Dewd yn ysgrifennu bod y feddwl wedi cael ei gysylltu a'i ddatblygu. Roedd y ddewision o'r Christianiaeth wedi cael ei ddod yn ôl yn Iwerddon. Roedden nhw'n cyffredin. Nid oedd yna rhywbeth arall i'w adnodd. Roedd pawb sy'n ei angen ar gyfer y dyfodol wedi cael ei ddod yn ôl i'r aelodau. Nid oedd Christianiaeth yn rhywbeth sydd wedi'i ddod yn ôl dros ystodau. Dydyn ni ddim angen newid o'r Dew. Roedd pawb sy'n ei angen ar gyfer y byd a'r diogelwch wedi'i ddod yn ôl yn ôl dros ystod y diogelwch. Ac yna roedd e'n cael ei ddod yn ôl i ni. A dyna pam mae'r Beibl yn y pen draw o'n bywyd y diogelwch. Dydyn ni ddim yn credu unrhyw beth newydd. Dydyn ni ddim yn teimlo ein bod angen i fod yn nofel er mwyn bod yn gysylltiedig. Na, dyma'r dyfodol wedi'i ddod yn ôl dros ystod y diogelwch. Ac mae'r dyfodol hwn, mae Jude'n ei ddweud, yn cael ei hysbysu. Edrychwch ar y ddewis 4. Mae'n ei ddweud yno, Mae'n ei ddweud yno, транwywir y graig ein dwyw gres o fewn i theistio, ac rhosno'n perffaith fy hunain ag yr isbwrdd a'r dydw i ddwyr, Jesus Chrsit Gwr печ?

Effective is that Jesus himself warned about wolves in sheep's clothing, weeds amongst the wheat. The most insidious opponents of the gospel have always come from within the church. But how are these people attacking the faith? Well, we might expect you to say, well these people, they're denying the resurrection. These people are saying that you need to earn your salvation. These people are saying that Jesus didn't really come in the flesh. But interestingly, the problem isn't heretical doctrine. The problem is heretical behaviour. Look again at verse 4, Jude calls them ungodly people who pervert the grace of our God into sensuality and deny our only Master and Lord Jesus Christ. They're taking God's grace and they're using it as a licence to sin. The word sensuality there often has sexual connotations. Their denial of Jesus is a practical denial. We might put it like this, with their mouths they proclaim Jesus as saviour, but with their lives they deny him as Lord. It's likely that some of these people have even risen to leadership positions in the church. So in verse 12, Jude refers to them as shepherds feeding themselves. Therefore, it seems like they were leading people in their folly. However, Jude reminds us that these people haven't surprised God. They haven't slipped by his notice. In fact, verse 4, he says they were long ago designated for this condemnation. God has already predicted their coming and appointed their destruction. In verses 5 to 16, Jude is going to further describe the ungodliness of these intruders. And then he's going to document the certain judgments that await them. Now, if you look at verse 5 to 16, at first glance, they seem very complicated, don't they? However, when we step back, I think there's a simple structure to this passage. We should have a chart on the screen for you. There we go. Hopefully, this is helpful to see the pattern Jude uses. He uses this pattern, which he repeats twice. Once he repeats, he gives this pattern in verses 5 to 10, and then he repeats it again in verses 11 to 16. The pattern is this. Jude is going to list three Old Testament examples. And each of these examples involves an occasion of ungodliness followed by a result in judgment. And then he's going to link those examples to the ungodly people who've crept into the church. And then he's going to reinforce his point using an extra biblical piece of literature. And lastly, he's then going to link that extra biblical piece of literature to the ungodly people again. And what Jude is doing is this. He's using the past to warn us about the future to make us contend for the faith in the present. Okay, I'll say that again. He's using the past to warn us about the future to make us contend for the faith in the present. Okay, so if you look in verse 5, he begins his blast from the past by saying this. Now, I want to remind you, although you once fully knew it, that Jesus, who saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe. The first Old Testament example is the unbelieving Israelites. The first Old Testament example is the unbelieving Israelites. So despite being rescued from slavery to Egypt, they refused to trust the Lord. Therefore, instead of entering the promised land, they were destroyed. Basically, for a time, they looked like God's people. However, their unbelieving hearts proved otherwise. And notice who it was who saved his people. Did you catch that? It was Jesus. Now, that's fascinating, isn't it? Because the Old Testament tells us that it was the Lord, Yahweh, the Almighty God, who rescued his people from Egypt. But the New Testament pulls back the curtain, and we see that Jesus is the Lord, Yahweh, the Almighty God, in the flesh. You know, sometimes people have this wrong understanding of the Bible. You know, there's the God of the Old Testament. He's kind of grumpy, and he likes to punish people. And then there's the God of the New Testament, Jesus. And he likes to love on people. And so people have this faulty understanding of the Bible, that we basically have two gods of two different characters. But no, Jude is blowing that thinking out of the water. Jesus is the God of the Old Testament. He's the God who saved his people, and he's the God who destroyed his enemies. That's why when we preach the Old Testament, every sermon's about Jesus. The second Old Testament example is found in verse 6. Jude mentions the angels who did not stay within their own position of authority, but left their proper dwelling. It's difficult to know exactly what event Jude is referring to here. Some scholars think he's referring to the original fall of angels. Others think it's that bizarre event in Genesis chapter 6. Whatever the answer is, the nature of their sin is clear. They've rebelled against God's authority. Therefore, he says, they've been kept in eternal chains under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great day. The third example there is in verse 7. Jude recalls God's judgment against Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities. He says that they indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire. The Greek term he uses there refers to homosexual practice. Basically, the sin of these cities was rebelling against God's natural order for sex. Therefore, he says God made an example of them. They underwent a punishment of eternal fire. Now, if you look at verse 8, we see how Jude links the ungodly of the past with the ungodly of the present. Yet, he says, in like manner, these people also. Jude is convinced that the same unbelieving, authority-rejecting, lustful ungodliness has infiltrated the church. He mentions a few characteristics of these people there. They rely on their dreams, he says. They're guided not by God's objective word, but by their subjective experience. To put it in modern terms, we might say this. They follow their heart. They choose to be true to themselves. This leads them to defile the flesh and indulge in sexual immorality. In order to justify their sin, they reject authority, he says. Specifically, the authority of God's word. And finally, he says, they blaspheme the glorious ones. It's difficult to know exactly what Jude means here. Most scholars think that they've been speaking irreverently about fallen angels. You know, maybe they had a cavalier attitude toward demonic forces. It's not difficult to imagine a charismatic leader with an over-realized eschatology, taunting the devil, speaking flippantly about demons, showing off how victorious he is in Christ. That may explain Jude's words in verse 9 there. Look at verse 9. He says, He did not presume to pronounce a blasphemous judgment, but said, That's obviously really clear and requires no further explanation, so we'll move on. I mean, seriously, what? Well, Jude recounts a story there about the archangel Michael disputing with Satan over Moses' body. And if you're thinking, hmm, I don't remember learning about that in Sunday school. That's because it's not in the Bible. This story was taken from a piece of Jewish literature called The Assumption of Moses. It was a story Jude's readers would have likely been familiar with. So Jude uses it to illustrate his point. And this might seem a little bit weird to us. However, it's not that weird when you think about it. It's kind of like me quoting from C.S. Lewis' The Screwtape Letters or John Milton's Paradise Lost. The story goes like this. When Moses died, there was some sort of legal dispute over his body. Presumably, the archangel Michael wanted to give Moses an honorable burial. However, Satan wanted to deprive him of that right. As the accuser, maybe he tried to establish Moses' guilt as a sinner. He wanted Moses for himself. Whatever the specifics might be, we might expect Michael to condemn the devil. However, rather than putting himself in God's place and pronouncing a judgment on Satan, he simply says, the Lord rebuke you. He leaves it up to God to judge. And the point here is that even the archangel Michael knows his place. Even he doesn't speak irreverently about fallen angels. Whether this story is true or not doesn't actually matter. Jude simply uses it as an illustration. And then in verse 10, he links this story back to the ungodly people. He says this, but these people blaspheme all they do not understand. And they are destroyed by all that they, like unreasoning animals, understand instinctively. These people are ignorant about Jesus, about angels, about sin, about God's grace. The only thing they understand, he says, is their bodily instincts. They're like unreasoning animals. They follow their subjective feelings and desires, but ultimately, he says, they'll be destroyed. See how Jude is using the past to warn us about the future? And he's going to repeat that same pattern now in verses 11 to 16. So look at verse 11. There he gives us three more Old Testament examples. He says, woe to them, for they walked in the way of Cain and abandoned themselves for the sake of gain to Balaam's error and perished in Korah's rebellion. Cain, Balaam, and Korah are all examples of ungodly people who were judged by God. Interestingly, if you read the Old Testament, you'll read about Cain first, then Korah, and then Balaam. However, Jude switches the order a little bit here. The question is why? Well, let's start with Cain. Well, let's start with Cain. In Genesis 4, God warned Cain that sin was crouching at his door. However, Cain ignored God's word. He murdered his brother Abel. And as a result, God punished them. He sent him out to be a wanderer on the earth. Well, what about Balaam? Balaam was a lover of money. He was a false prophet for hire. And he influenced Moabite women to sleep with Israelite men. And as a result, not only was Balaam judged, but a large number of people were judged along with him. And what about Korah? Well, we read about Korah earlier in the service, didn't we? He led a rebellion against God's prophet Moses. And nearly 15,000 people followed him. And they all perished with him in judgment. In other words, there's this progressive danger in verse 11. With each example, more people experienced judgment for their ungodliness. Can you see what Judah's doing? He's saying that ungodly people in the church are dangerous, not only because they'll be destroyed, but because they'll drag along people into judgment with them. In verses 12 to 13, Jude applies all this to the intruders. And he gives us a flurry of word pictures. He says there, These are hidden reefs at your love feasts, as they feast with you without fear. These godless people are participating in something Jude calls the love feasts. They would have basically been early Christian meetings that involved the Lord's Supper. However, they feel no pang of conscience about their hypocrisy. And like hidden reefs, which destroyed unsuspecting ships, they're incredibly dangerous. Jude calls them shepherds feeding themselves. They're like the bad shepherds of Ezekiel 34, living for themselves at the expense of God. Living for themselves at the expense of God's flock. He calls them the waterless clouds swept along by winds. Now, honestly, as an Englishman, that sounds like a compliment. Because I grew up in a giant cold shower. However, in the Near East, where it's always hot, clouds are a blessing. They water the crops and bring a harvest. Clouds equals life. These people are like waterless clouds. They promise rain, but don't deliver. They promise life, but bring only death. He says they're their fruitless trees in late autumn, twice dead, uprooted. They bring death because they're spiritually dead themselves. They talk the talk, but their life bears no lasting fruit. He says they're their wild waves of the sea, casting up the foam of their own shame. The sea in the Bible is a metaphor for chaos and danger. Not only do these people lack good fruit, but they abound in evil fruit. Have you ever been to the beach and then there's that gross foam along the shore? That's a picture of the shameful mess that these people leave in their wake. Finally, he says they're like wandering stars for whom the gloom of utter darkness has been reserved forever. The stars were like the equivalent of GPS for ancient people. They were like Google Maps. They would use them to navigate where they were headed. Jude says that ungodly people only lead others astray to the utter darkness of hell. Selfish, useless, fruitless, lifeless, dangerous, avoid them. This brings us to Jude's second extra biblical reference in verses 14 to 15. He quotes from the book of Enoch, which was a well-known piece of Jewish literature at the time. And the quote highlights God's judgment against ungodliness four times in just one sentence, the idea of ungodliness. Jude lists some examples of ungodliness in verse 16. Again, linking it back to the ungodly people of his day. These are grumblers, malcontents, following their own sinful desires. They're perpetually discontent, complaining about their circumstances, murmuring against God and his providence. Like the grumbling Israelites, they long to return to Egypt. They long to return to Egypt, to live under slavery to sin. He says they're loudmouth boasters, loudmouth boasters showing favoritism to gain advantage. They like to talk. They like the spotlight. They're narcissistic. And they have their favorites too. You know, they're good at turning church into a game of politics. Whether it's gaining wealth, power, or influence, they know how to manipulate people. These are the kinds of people who creep into churches. So what are we meant to take from all this? Well, let me suggest two applications for us. First application is this. We need to recognize the threat of ungodliness. We need to recognize the threat of ungodliness. Ungodly people creep into churches, and they sometimes even end up in leadership positions. How does this happen? Well, sometimes it's because they're gifted. Maybe they're a great preacher or a dynamic leader, and they appear to be doing good ministry. And this causes people to overlook their character faults. We tell ourselves, okay, I know they have an anger problem. I know they're a bit controlling. I know they act inappropriately. I know they don't respond well to rebuke. But look at all the good they're doing. Sometimes ungodly people remain hidden because they're impressive. Maybe they have a great grasp of theology. Maybe they have a charismatic personality. Maybe they're smart, rich, influential. Maybe they're just really likable. And so their impressiveness blinds people to their true character. Sometimes ungodly people are just really good at hiding. They know how to keep up appearances. They know how to act wholly in public. They know how to act wholly in public. They know the right words to say in the right tone to the right people. They know how to keep others at a distance. They even know how to keep their spouse and kids quiet about who they truly are in the home. That's exactly why Judah's writing this letter. Throughout church history, the most insidious opposition to the gospel has come from within churches. Now listen, Judah isn't writing this letter to make us paranoid, okay? So if you suddenly feel suspicious about the person next to you, you can just relax for a second. You know, in all the cultural and political division we're experiencing, I think some Christians have become over suspicious of one another. So I don't think we should do that. But I think Jude does want us to be alert. Because we can't contend for the faith if we don't know that we're in a battle. So how do we fight against ungodliness in the church? Well, I think that's one of the reasons that we have church membership. We only admit people to membership who we believe are truly Christians. Not just in what they say, but in also how they live. And if people are living in unrepentant sin, if they're living a double life, if they're being hypocrites, we need to speak the truth to them in love. To gently, lovingly rebuke them. But if they don't stop, we need to lovingly discipline them out of the church. But having church membership isn't enough, is it? We actually need to know one another. Because we can only hide our true character for so long. And ungodliness thrives in secrecy. Therefore, we need to let others into our lives. If we want to contend for the faith, we need to be committed to transparency, to live in the light together. This also means appointing elders is a serious business. So if all we're looking for is theological brilliance, and engaging personality or ministerial gifts, then we're asking for trouble. It's vital that we appoint people to lead us who are godly. If you look at the qualifications for elders in the New Testament, apart from the ability to teach, they're all about godly character. That's one of the reasons we have a rigorous elder process at our church. We've learned that we need to spend a long time assessing a person's character. So one of the things that we do is we look at their character. So one of the things that we do is we have a godly woman in the church interview the wife of any prospective elder to make sure that the person they are in public is the same person they are in private. We also want to make sure that every one of our elders is known by multiple people in the church. There are people who know what we're like behind closed doors. And we seek to be transparent about our sin struggles and weaknesses. And we want you to keep us accountable. And we covet your prayers that we would fight sin and pursue the Lord Jesus. Finally, we also need to be careful about who we're following. Who are we listening to? What are we reading? What people are shaping the way we think and act? I think in the age of the internet, this is a huge issue. Because people can actually creep into our church without being physically present here with us. We need to constantly ask ourselves, are those I'm being influenced by bearing good fruit in my life? Are they making me more godly? Are they helping me to love Jesus and trust the Bible more? Are they helping me to hate my sin and not just other people's sin? Or are they just making me more fearful? Isolated? Angry? Discontent? Suspicious? Argumentative? Tribal? Divisive? Or worldly? You know, in some ways, it's great being able to learn from people across the world, isn't it? Particularly other Bible teachers. However, we need to be careful because we can find ourselves being pastored by people that we don't even know. The primary means of our discipleship should never be celebrity pastors, best-selling authors, social influencers, online blogs, or talking heads. No, it should be the local church. Because the local church is where we live out the gospel together. So that's the first thing. We need to recognize the threat of ungodliness. Secondly, we need to remember the outcome of ungodliness. Look again at verse 5. Now, I want to remind you, although you once fully knew it, we're prone to forget, aren't we? So we need to be constantly reminded about what we already know. Jude keeps pointing us back to the Old Testament and saying, look what happens to the ungodly. They're destroyed. Not only that, but they drag along others with them. And we're meant to learn from their example. When we find ungodliness creeping into our lives, grumbling, greed, rebelling against authority, sexual sin, following our desires instead of God's word, using God's grace as an excuse to sin. We need to remember the ungodly will be destroyed. Using God's grace as an excuse to sin, we need to remember the ungodly will be destroyed. I think young people particularly need this reminder. So if you're one of the children here, if you're one of the youth, the world does not encourage you to be godly. It will tell you to live your truth, to be your own boss, to trust your inner voice, to follow your feelings, to do whatever you want with your body. And you know what? You'll even find churches and preachers who reinforce those messages. They'll tell you that God just wants you to be happy. They'll teach you that you can have Jesus and your sin. They'll tell you that the Bible's sexual ethics are no longer relevant. And those messages are going to sound attractive to you. However, you need to remember the ungodly will be destroyed. Remember Jude, he's using the past to warn us about the future so that we might contend for the faith in the present. But what if you're here this morning and you're not a Christian? I mean, this is probably being a difficult sermon to hear because Jude is very clear about what will happen to the ungodly. And I think there are two bad ways you could respond to Jude. Firstly, you could just ignore him. You could conclude that God doesn't really care about your sin, that God won't really punish the ungodly. Secondly, you could try to be godly. You could try to become more religious. You could try to obey God's word, clean up your act, become a better person. However, both of these responses end in God's judgment because neither response deals with the problem of your sin. So what should you do? You should do this. Turn to Christ. You should do this. Turn to Christ. Recognise Jesus as your Saviour and your Lord because here's the thing, Jesus lived a perfect life of godliness. However, he died in your place. He was punished for our ungodliness. He was destroyed for our unbelief. He was condemned for our guilt. He was perished for our rebellion. And then he rose from the grave in victory and he conquered sin and death. And now he offers salvation to anyone who would turn to him in simple faith. So if you turn to Christ, he'll save you from the penalty of sin. You'll no longer have to fear God's judgment because all your judgments will be taken care of on the cross. But Jesus will also save you from the power of sin. You'll no longer have to live in slavery to ungodliness. And this is all a gift. There's nothing you need to contribute. You just need to receive Jesus as your Saviour and your Lord. So let me urge you to do that this morning if you've never done it. And if you are a Christian this morning, then let me ask you as we close. Where has ungodliness crept into your life? Are there ways you're currently perverting the grace of God? Using God's grace as a license for sin? Are you cultivating a rebellious spirit? Are you indulging in sexual sin? Are you ignoring God's word? Are you worshiping money? Are you endlessly grumbling? Are you following your own sinful desires? Do you show partiality to certain types of people in order to gain advantage? Are you divisive? When you look at your life, are there ways that you are denying Jesus as your Master and Lord? If so, let Jude remind you, although you once fully knew it, that God will destroy the ungodly. But here's the good news. That's not who you are anymore. Remember who you are in Jesus Christ. Christian, remember what Jude said? You've been called out of darkness into God's marvelous light. Why would you still live in the dark? You've been called into fellowship with God's Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. Why would you fellowship with sin? Christian, you're beloved in God the Father. He's adopted you as His child. Don't you want to imitate and please your Heavenly Father? Christian, you're being kept for Jesus Christ. Christian, you're being kept for Jesus Christ. We'll think more about that next week. But look, listen, whatever sin is promising you, it can't be better than that. So Church, let us look to the past and be warned about the future so that we might contend for the faith in the present. Let's pray together. Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for the Gospel. We thank you that you have called us out of darkness into your marvelous light. Thank you that in Christ were your beloved children and that you promised to keep your people until the end. Would you use these warnings in Jude as a means to that end, Lord? Would we recognize the threat of ungodliness? Not just out there, but in here, in our own hearts, in our own midst. And we pray that we would remember that you will destroy the ungodly. We thank you, Lord, that for those in Christ, our ungodliness has been crucified on the cross. And so we've been delivered from the penalty and the power of sin. And so we pray, Lord, that the Gospel would motivate us to leave here, Lord, with hearts loving you and on alert, ready to contend for the faith once for all delivered to the saints. Amen.
