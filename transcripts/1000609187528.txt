the soldiers led him away inside the palace that is the governor's headquarters and they called together the whole battalion and they clothed him in a purple cloak and twisting together a crown of thorns they put it on him and they began to salute him hail king of the Jews and they were striking his head with a reed and spitting on him and kneeling down in homage to him and when they had mocked him they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes on him and they led him out to crucify him and they compelled a passerby Simon of Cyrene who was coming in from the country the father of Alexander and Rufus to carry his cross and they brought him to the place called Golgotha which means place of a skull and they offered him wine mixed with myrrh but he did not take it and they crucified him and divided his garments among them casting lots for them to decide what each should take and it was the third hour when they crucified him and the inscription of the charge against him read the king of the Jews and with him they crucified two robbers one on his right and one on his left and those who passed by derided him wagging their heads and saying aha you who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days save yourself and come down from the cross so also the chief priest with the scribes mocked him to one another saying he saved others he cannot save himself let the Christ the king of Israel come down now from the cross that we may see and believe those who were crucified with him also reviled him when the sixth hour had come there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour and at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice loi loi lemma sabbathani which means my god my god why have you forsaken me and some of the bystanders hearing it said behold he is calling Elijah and someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink saying wait let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down and Jesus uttered a loud cry and breathed his last and the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom and when the centurion who stood facing him saw that in this way he breathed his last he said truly this man was the Son of God well if if you look in your bulletins you'll find a picture of the so-called Alexa menos graffito this is the earliest surviving depiction that we have of Jesus it dates back to around 200 AD and it was scratched onto the wall of an ancient Roman building you'll see there that it depicts a human like figure hanging from a cross but this figure has the head of a donkey next to the cross just to the left there is a young man with his hand raised and beneath the cross there is a caption there that reads Alexa menos worships his God it's interesting isn't it that the first known depiction of Jesus is graffiti style mockery the idea that Christians would worship a crucified Savior has always been seen as foolish laughable shameful and this shouldn't surprise Israeli after all the cross was an instrument of shame the Romans reserved crucifixion for the very worst of criminals it was a way to deter people from stepping out of line through the cross the Romans wouldn't simply defeat their opponents they would humiliate them victims would be tortured ridiculed stripped and nailed to a cross their their suffering was purposely drawn out so that they'd endure a long and painful death this was all done in public the cross was so shameful that Roman citizens were discouraged from even talking about it for a Jew to be crucified was doubly shameful in the Old Testament God declared that anyone hanged on a tree is cursed therefore in Jewish thinking to be hanged on a wooden cross was to be judged by God the shame of the cross is a major theme in the crucifixion accounts I wonder if you noticed as Mike read from Mark chapter 15 a moment ago there Jesus wasn't just killed was he he was ridiculed he was shamed humiliated mocked first of all notice that he was mocked by the soldiers look again at verse 17 there of Mark chapter 15 after Jesus is sentenced to be crucified these soldiers decide to have a bit of fun they dress him up in a purple cloak they twist together a crown of thorns and and place it on his head they ironically salute him hail King of the Jews they then begin striking his head with a reed they spit on him they kneel down in homage to him they essentially give Jesus a mock coronation they completely and utterly humiliate him they take pleasure in his shame they delight in dehumanizing him but the mocking doesn't end with the soldiers Jesus is also mocked by Pontius Pilate let's look at verse 26 after Jesus is nailed to the cross a sign is placed above his head we're told in other gospel accounts that this sign was posted at the request of a man named Pontius Pilate he was the Roman governor who sentenced Jesus to be crucified this sign had an inscription on it we're told of the charge against Jesus it read the King of the Jews it was meant to be ironic of course Pilate was sending a message this is what happens to wannabe rivals of Caesar but he was also making fun of Jesus I mean what kind of King finds himself hanging on a Roman cross but the mocking doesn't end with Pilate Jesus is also mocked by the crowds look at verse 29 as Jesus hangs there they begin to deride and taunt him aha you who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days save yourself and come down from the cross so much for your big claims Jesus well look at you now they think this is all hilarious but the mocking doesn't end with the crowds Jesus is also mocked by the religious leaders look at verses 31 to 32 so also the chief priests with the scribes mocked him to one another saying he saved others he cannot save himself let the Christ the King of Israel come down now from the cross that we may see and believe but the mocking doesn't end with the religious PhDs of the day Jesus is even mocked by the two robbers these robbers were told in verse 27 are crucified alongside him one on his right and one on his left at the end of verse 32 they to decide to revile him to revile means to heap shame on someone to verbally abuse them to taunt them isn't it amazing that even these men as they crucified find the energy to insult Jesus the soldiers pilots the crowd the religious leaders the two robbers Jesus is mocked and humiliated by every angle from every angle now my assumption is that everyone in this room is appalled at their behavior I mean maybe you're thinking goodness what terrible people it can be really difficult to to see ourselves in the crucifixion account after all I think most of us could not imagine mocking someone in their death especially someone like Jesus here's someone who went around serving the poor healing the sick liberating the oppressed befriending the outcasts he taught people to love and forgive and save one another to kill a man like Jesus is shocking enough but to mock him it's almost unthinkable why wasn't it enough to simply destroy Jesus why did they have to shame him too what was it about Jesus that aroused such scorn and ridicule maybe you notice this but there's a common theme at the heart of their mockery throughout this passage Jesus is jokingly referred to time and time again as a king did you notice that he's even dressed up as a king they facetiously bowed down to him as a king in other words Jesus is mocked for his claim to be king it's this claim that fuels their ridicule it's this claim that ignites their scorn but why what is it about Jesus claim to be king that provokes such mockery in his confessions Augustine tells a story about the time when as a young man he broke into a pear orchard and stole some pears and as he's looking back he's trying to figure out like why did he do that because here's the thing one he wasn't hungry and two he didn't even like pears and he comes to the conclusion that the reason he stole the pears was because someone told him that he couldn't and as he reflects Augustine realized something about his heart and and therefore all of our hearts he realized that there's something in the human heart that says nobody tells me what to do we like to be our own boss don't we we like we don't like to submit to others we we don't like to be told how to live we like to occupy the throne of our lives but then Jesus comes along with this enormous and exclusive claim he claims to be the Christ the anointed one the King of Kings and Lord of Lords and we hate this claim most of us are fine with Jesus being a good moral example we're happy for him to be a wise teacher we're okay with him being one of many paths and many of us tell ourselves that that's who Jesus was however when Jesus claims to be King it forces us to make a decision because now we can't simply like Jesus it's all or nothing either Jesus really is the King and therefore we need to center our lives around him or he's not the King and therefore he's a joke he's a fool you know we might balk at the absurd behavior of those who mock Jesus but at least they took his claim seriously you know maybe you're here tonight and your life is not centered around Jesus you don't you don't recognize him as your King maybe you even have a level of respect for Jesus you think he was a good person and you'd certainly you've certainly never found his death to be a laugh and matter and so for you it's really difficult to see yourself in this crucifixion account but if that describes you tonight can I just suggest that you actually haven't taken Jesus claims seriously because he claims to be the King he claims to be God himself in the flesh and that means he claims to rule over the universe he claims to have authority over everything including you he claims to decide what is true and false right and wrong he demands your total and complete allegiance he even claims to have final say over your thoughts and your words and your actions and your feelings and your stuff I mean these are enormous and exclusive claims it really is all or nothing with Jesus and I think when you realize that you see that it forces you to make a decision you can either mock him as a fool or worship him as your king but you just can't be neutral with Jesus you can't sit on the fence because Jesus just doesn't give us that option his claims are too enormous and too exclusive are you beginning to see why Jesus was so despised because let's be honest we love our autonomy don't we we like to be self-governing we like to decide for ourselves what is right and wrong true or false we like to have authority over our own lives we don't appreciate it when someone else tells us how we should think and feel what should we what we should do with our bodies or our time or our money we like to be the captain of our soul and so when our autonomy is threatened it's not enough to simply destroy that threat we must humiliate it mock it ridicule it we must expose any threat to our autonomy as laughable and shameful but there's another reason Jesus claim mockery it doesn't actually look like a king does he he looks weak powerless where where is his army where is his resistance like a lamb led to the slaughter he is silent he offers no defense what kind of King allows himself to be betrayed captured and condemned what kind of King wears a crown of thorns what kind of King is anointed with human spittle what kind of King is exalted on a cross we we don't have a category for a king like this a king who comes in weakness throughout this passage Jesus seems so weak and powerless doesn't he he can't even carry his own cross he's stripped naked his clothes are divided among the soldiers in verse 30 there the crowd taunts him save yourself and come down from the cross but he doesn't or look again at verses 31 to 32 the religious leaders challenge Jesus to show some strength to to exhibit some power to pull out those nails and get down from the cross only then they claim will they believe to them a crucified Savior is more of a jester than a than a king but we need to see the deeper irony to their words look at verse 31 again he saved others but he cannot save himself here's the irony they're absolutely right the only way Jesus could save others was precisely by not saving himself if Jesus saved himself if he got down from the cross then he couldn't save others the cross was necessary Jesus had to die he had to endure shame and humiliation and that's because of what Jesus came to save us from he came to save us from our sin and again we naturally mock this idea don't we that someone needs to die for our sin because the society we live in tells us that we're actually good people sure we do bad things from time to time but but at our core we are inherently good yet the Bible tells us something different something that people tend to mock it tells us that we do bad things because at our core there's actually something rotten wicked evil in fact we're so bad we need rescuing we the king to come and save us from our sin and the only way he can do that is through a shameful cross and to many people that very idea is offensive and not just offensive ridiculous laughable you know we're perfectly happy with the Jesus who just came to give us some tips for self-improvement or a Jesus who offers us an inspiring example of courage and self-sacrifice or even a Jesus who spreads a message of sentimental love and peace but a Jesus who dies a shameful death on a cross in order to save us from our sin this is not the Jesus we naturally want yet it is the Jesus we actually need a couple of months ago I I informed my daughter that she had to tidy up her room before she watched TV I've got a permission to share this story I informed her that she had to tidy up her room tidy up the mess before she watched any TV to which she responded but dad I'm just a child and so I said you're actually six years old and you're able to clean up your own mess but she of course had a rebuttal up her sleeve she said actually there are some times when a grown-up should clean up a child's mess like when it's too dangerous for children to clean up their own mess to which I interjected well the mess in your room is not dangerous to clean up but she continued in her closing arguments she said or if the mess is so bad that a child could not possibly clean her up my daughter's obviously grown up in a church full of lawyers so thank you for that everyone now we mustn't think that our sin is like a messy child's room it like a child's messy room because when it comes to our sin we're actually not able to clean our mess up in fact it is actually dangerous for us to try and clean up the mess of our sin you see the Bible says that each one of us is guilty of high treason we've rebelled against the King of the universe we've sought to usurp his throne we've transgressed his commands we've we've opposed his authority and this makes us guilty before God but that's not all because sin dehumanizes us it makes us less than we were meant to be we've become morally impure and corrupt and defiled and before the eyes of a holy God were utterly exposed we see this right at the beginning of the Bible in Genesis chapter 3 when Adam and Eve first sinned they immediately experienced shame they hide and cover their cover themselves sin leads to guilt but sin also leads to shame and we all know that feeling of shame don't we that sense there's something wrong with us we know we're not the people were meant to be and so we fear being seen by others we fear the humiliation and so we hide or we try and cover up our shame with proverbial fig leaves we try to mask our shame with with good deeds or personal achievements or drugs and alcohol or or entertainment and distraction wherever it is but the shame doesn't actually go away does it as much as we try and clean up the mess of our sin the guilt and the shame just remain and one day the Bible says God will hold us to account we must all appear before his judgment seat and there'll be nowhere to hide on that day and we will face the judgment of eternal condemnation and shame for our sin and friends this is why we celebrate Good Friday because Jesus came to save us from our sin he came to deal with both our guilt and our shame that's why he willingly went to the cross because on the cross he took the punishment that our sins deserved he was condemned in our place he the innocent one was treated as though he were guilty but that's not all because as we've been seeing Jesus also bore our shame he took on our disgrace he endured our reproach he suffered the humiliation and the mockery that our shame deserved why did he do that well because he loves us not because we're lovable we're guilty and vile and helpless yet for the joy of seeing his people forgiven and reconciled to God Jesus endured the cross despising the shame he suffered ridicule humiliation and scorn and that friends is the kind of King we have in Jesus let me ask you don't you want to follow that kind of King don't you want to entrust your life to a King like Jesus look here's the good news of the cross if you trust in Jesus if you acknowledge him as your King you receive him as your Savior he will take your guilt and he'll exchange it for his righteousness he'll take your shame and he'll exchange it for his honor his blood will cleanse you from your sin you'll stand before God blameless pure and holy and this is all a free gift there's nothing you can do to earn it there's nothing you can do to contribute all you have to do is receive this good news by faith so if you've never done that then let me encourage you let me urge you tonight to receive Christ to trust in Jesus as your King and as your Savior you see there's there's a delicious irony to this passage because it turns out the man mocked as King is actually the King and the cross really is his coronation because it's through the weakness of the cross that Jesus displays his power the King who can't save others sorry the King who can't save himself really does save others Jesus proved this by conquering sin and death three days later he rose from the grave in victory and one day our glorious King is returning every I will see him he'll be dressed in dreadful majesty and there'll be no mocking no insults no scorn every knee will bow before the judge of all eternity and for those who recognize Jesus as their King well the Bible has good news Romans 10 11 the scripture says everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame on the cross Jesus bore our shame so that we can share in his honor and his glory what a Savior let's pray Lord Jesus we we come to you tonight and we praise you and we thank you for the cross we thank you that you for the joy that was set before you endured the cross despising the shame and now you are seated at the right hand of God in glory as the King Lord we recognize you as the King today as the one who has saved us from our greatest enemies Satan and sin and death and we put our trust in you afresh today and we give you all the honor and glory and we pray all these things in your name Amen
