Well, good morning, everybody. My name is Ryan, and it's my pleasure to open up to Psalm 32 with you this morning. That's our passage, Psalm 32. If you're using one of the Bibles within reach there, it's on page 462, Psalm 32. Psalm 32 begins with the word blessed, which can also be translated happy. And it just so happens that a few weeks ago, a sociology professor at the University of Chicago published the latest in a very lengthy study on the topic of happiness and how happy we are, or not so happy we are. This study has been going on for about 50 years. For about 50 years, scientists have been asking Americans this question. Thinking of your life today, would you say that you are very happy, pretty happy, or not so happy? Apparently, those are your only options. Very, happy, I see the wheels turning, pretty happy, or not so happy? I will leave it to you to sort through the vast happiness literature that has come out of that study, books and podcasts and articles and classes at Harvard and Yale and lots of other places. You can go learn about what it is, actually, that people say makes them happy. Spoiler alert, it's not going to be a big surprise to you. It's things like meaningful relationships, expressing gratitude for the good things in life, exercise, being outside. In fact, if you had a bunch of grateful friends who like to be outside and exercise together, you are concentrating all of your happiness in one place. You're in a very good spot. You are very likely to be at least pretty happy. But even as I asked you that question and gave you some of the findings, which again, you can find out for yourself, I've not read all of that literature, but I am almost certain there is one answer that's not included, and it's the one that we have in Psalm 32, verse 1. Blessed or happy is the one whose transgressions are forgiven. It's interesting. The book of Psalms begins with that word. You may remember a few months ago when Pastor Bill was preaching on Psalm 1, it began in a very similar way. Blessed is the one who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked. That's that same word, blessed or happy. It's actually the same word Jesus used to begin his most famous sermon. Blessed are the poor in spirit. Also, by the way, not one of the findings of the study that being poor in spirit leads to increased happiness. Why is that? Well, because we understand, I think all of us know intuitively as well, that happiness, like what we're really after when we say, wow, I'd really love to be very happy, we're talking about more than just a surge of positive emotions or being in a good mood or, you know, seeing the silver lining or just kind of having like an optimistic outlook. What we mean is this deep, settled satisfaction with life. Some of you will know the hymn. It is well with my soul. That's a song about happiness, that even when life is falling apart, when there are plenty of things in the world and in our lives that ought to make us sad, we can still sing, it is well with my soul. It's an enduring, lasting joy. And the question that Psalm 32 asks all of us this morning, do you know the joy of being forgiven? Blessed is the one whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. Blessed is the man against whom the Lord counts no iniquity and in whose spirit there is no deceit. For when I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long. For day and night, your hand was heavy upon me. My strength was dried up as by the heat of summer. I acknowledged my sin to you and I did not cover my iniquity. I said, I will confess my transgressions to the Lord. And you forgave the iniquity of my sin. Therefore, let everyone who is godly offer prayer to you at a time when you may be found. Surely in the rush of great waters, they shall not reach him. You are a hiding place for me. You preserve me from trouble. You surround me with shouts of deliverance. I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go. I will counsel you with my eye upon you. Be not like a horse or mule without understanding, which must be curved with bit and bridle or it will not stay near you. Many are the sorrows of the wicked, but steadfast love surrounds the one who trusts in the Lord. Be glad in the Lord and rejoice, O righteous, and shout for joy, all you upright in heart. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Our Father, we pray that you would open our hearts and our lives to your word now. Holy Spirit, that you would shape and transform us by these words that you have inspired and preserved to this day. We pray, Lord, that you would teach us the joy of being forgiven. We ask in Jesus name. Amen. All right. So how do you experience the joy of being forgiven? And I recognize I'm asking that, you know, on Sunday at church when in some ways this should be a given, this should be the reason we're all here. But it's also true, I think, that there are some of us in this room who believe that God has forgiven us of our sin. And yet, when I asked that question a second ago, you would say you're not too happy. And then there are others of us in this room who maybe really don't think much about God or sin or forgiveness, just maybe give it a passing thought every once in a while. And when I asked that question, you're very happy. There's often a disconnect between what we believe about God's forgiveness, what we actually experience. Does it actually translate to joy? And so this morning I want to talk about, as we work through this psalm, how you connect being forgiven by God for your sins and experiencing joy and happiness. And I want to do that by asking two questions that I think you have to work through in order to get to a place of real joy at the idea that we really are forgiven by God for all of our sins. Question number one, is forgiveness even necessary? Is it necessary? Secondly, is forgiveness liberating? Is it necessary? Is it liberating? Now, the first question, that might be a subtle question for many of you, a settled question, that is to say, again, here we are on Sunday, some of you, probably all of you at some level participated in the confession of sin, not once but twice. We got it once with the corporate confession, and then once again with the Lord's prayer. So it's familiar to you to bring these things before the Lord in the context of worship. And so it might seem like kind of an odd question, is forgiveness necessary? Well, of course you would say it is, but I also don't want to presume that you feel that way because we live in a culture and we work with people and we live next to people and we're in families that have a very different idea of what our relationship with God looks like if it's even considered. And I would say the prevailing view in our culture is that this idea that God is a moral authority and that we're accountable to him in any significant way, that just seems like an outdated notion for many people. Maybe for some of you, that seems tone deaf with the level of sophistication we've reached in the 21st century in the West. And then there are other people who would say it's not just outdated, it's actually a dangerous idea. It's hazardous for your health. Like, you shouldn't think that way. It's just going to bring all kinds of guilt trips into your life. I mean, that's not good for you. It's certainly not going to lead to happiness and joy. What you have to do is get out from underneath that way of thinking. That's how many people think about forgiveness and sin and God. And even if you wouldn't go that far, let's just be honest, when you hear David talking about his sin in such gritty detail and with such vivid imagery, bones wasting away and strength being sapped like in the heat of summer, we wonder, you know, maybe David just needs to go a little lighter. He just needs to lighten up a little bit. He needs to forgive himself, you know, a little self-care. He's getting carried away, melodramatic. You see, the reason that David speaks this way, the reason he chooses three different to capture and articulate what his sin is, is he really believes that his sin is serious. Because he really believes that his sin is a personal offense against a holy God. A personal offense. The language he uses just in verse one alone, this word transgression, the original word carries with it this connotation of tearing yourself away or breaking loose. And so what David is saying just by using that word is his understanding of sin is not just he broke some cosmic code out there. What he's saying is, in effect, what I've done is I've torn myself away from the embrace of the God who loves me. I've broken loose from the authority of God who rightfully has authority over me. It's as if David is understanding that his sin is a way of saying to the Lord, I don't want you. I don't need you. I prefer to live my life as if you didn't exist. And just think with me for a second. If you had that kind of conversation with somebody who loves you and who has showered goodness and blessing into your life, if you said that to someone who loves you, just imagine the damage that would be done to the relationship. Actually, some of you don't have to imagine it. You've said it. Or you've had someone say it to you. A spouse, a child, a friend. So we know just even in our own relationships the damage that's done when we reject someone's love and we say, I don't need it. I don't want it. I'd rather live my life without you. And so friends, we're kidding ourselves. If we think the only thing that needs to happen between us and God is just to forgive yourself and move on, that's just not the way any relationship works. And it's certainly not the way that our relationship with God works, especially when we consider that God is holy and just. He can't just turn a blind eye to evil, including the evil in your own heart and your own life. It has to be dealt with. As one person has said, it's like at the end of a meal, the bill comes and it's on the table and everyone's looking at it. Someone's going to pay it. And when wrong has been done in a relationship, there's a bill on the table. Someone's going to have to pay it, either by forgiving that person and absorbing that cost yourself or making amends and apologizing and taking the cost on yourself. That's what David is saying when he says, this is the underlying assumption of this psalm, that there is real transgression that must be forgiven by God. Not ignored. That there are sins that have to be covered. The image there is kind of put out of sight, like, you know, just let's move that off to the side. That's done for now. Like, someone's going to have to do that. There's iniquity that David says rightfully is counted against me. Something dramatic, intentional, has to be done. There's a story about a judge from the 1930s and 40s who specialized in juvenile law. So a lot of the people who came into his courtroom were teenagers, 13-, 14-, 15-year-old teenagers who had made a big mistake in life, committed crimes, and were going to have to pay the penalty. And so he specialized in nuancing the sentence for restoration. He really was a pioneer in that. And so many of the case files that he had after 30 years of being a judge in this city, many of them were like these stacks of files, these thick files on young people who had over 20, 30 years grown up. Like, they'd served their sentence. They'd moved on with life. They'd turned their lives around. Some had gotten married, started families, had careers. And so the judge, at the end of his career, as he's nearing retirement, realizes that he's sitting on all of these boxes of incriminating evidence. And he thought to himself, you know, if these files fell into the wrong hands, they could do a lot of damage in the lives of these people who've really moved on and tried to put their lives back together. And so he decided to do something radical and probably illegal, is he put them all in the back of his car. He drove them out of town. He dug a hole. He put them all in. He poured gasoline all over them and lit a match and burned all of them. Because he didn't want those sins to ever be counted against them. Now, some of us think about God, and our assumption is that that kind of radical forgiveness is just kind of like in his job description. It's like, what does God do? Well, he creates the world, I guess. He sustains the world. He gives me beautiful sunsets, and he forgives me of stuff. He's loving. He's gracious. And so, you know, he sees my sin and he goes, don't worry about that. I got you. Even those of us who are Christians kind of sometimes get in this rhythm. We're like, well, I just ask forgiveness and God forgives me because that's who he is. He's a forgiving God. And yes, God is gracious and his steadfast love endures forever. We're going to see this again next week in another psalm, that at the heart of God is this heart of grace and forgiveness and compassion. But we can't make the mistake of thinking that forgiveness doesn't cost him anything. It's free to you. It's not free to him. You see, the good news is that God really has made a way for you to be able to sit here today and know with confidence that your sins, past, present, and future, will not be held against you. That they won't be counted against you. But you have to understand why. The reason that's true is because God sent his son to have our sins counted against him. That on the cross, Jesus was numbered among the transgressors. The Bible tells us that he took the blame for the sins we committed. That he endured the righteous anger of God and the judgment of God that you and I deserve forever. He endured that on the cross that we might know forgiveness. That those sins wouldn't be counted against us. That that file would be burned and never be brought back up again. Isn't it amazing that the finished work of Christ allows us to say by faith God's not bringing up our sins in that way anymore. They are done once and for all. They have been paid for. You know that bill on the table, it's God taking that and paying it himself for you. And what's even more amazing is in the resurrection, three days later, Jesus is providing the public display and confirmation that our sins have been paid in full. So yes, yes, forgiveness is necessary. And the good news is that Jesus makes forgiveness possible. Do you know that? Have you thought about what it cost God to forgive you? And yet, that he did it willingly. It's the cross that actually shows you how serious your sin is. It required nothing less than the death of the Son of God. And also how expansive and infinite God's love for you is. That he was willing to do it. And this brings us to our second question. Because I'm convinced if you really understand forgiveness is necessary and possible through Jesus, then forgiveness ought to be liberating for us. But the fact is it's often not, right? Like even those of us who have been Christians for a long time, 20, 30, 40, 50 years, we struggle sometimes to get out from underneath the weight of guilt and shame and regret. Some of you walked in with that backpack this morning. Like you haven't put it down yet. You feel it. It's digging into your shoulders. It's the guilt of your shame that you feel. And then on top of that, another plate of weight, shame. And then on top of that, regret. And yet when you listen to David speak, first of all, what's wonderful is he's so honest about what that feels like when we are living with unconfessed sin. And now you realize he's not being melodramatic. He's actually describing what all of us experience in life, in the Christian life, when we, as he says in verse 3, keep silent. When we harbor secret and unconfessed sin, when we keep silent, our bones feel like they're wasting away. We feel the Lord's hand heavy upon us. And our strength dried up as in the heat of summer. Now we've had pretty nice weather here the last week or so in D.C. So in most cases, in August in D.C., that verse would really hit home. But you get the idea. The idea is that shame just sucks the joy and the life right out of you. I read across an interview with Ben Affleck, the actor. And if you know anything about his life, lots of success at a very young age. And then he's had a pretty troubled personal life in the last 5, 10 years. Struggled with alcohol. Led to a subsequent divorce. And in this article a couple years ago, I was struck by how honest he is in this article about his struggle. Here are some of the things that he said. He said, you know, I'm trying to make myself feel better with eating or drinking or sex or gambling or shopping or whatever. But it just ended up making my life worse. It just became this vicious cycle I couldn't break, you know. I felt bad about myself for what I did. So I'd do more of what I was doing to make myself feel better. But it wasn't making me feel any better. And then he says this. The biggest regret of my life is my divorce. Biggest regret. And shame is really toxic. There is no positive byproduct of shame. It's just stewing in a toxic, hideous feeling of low self-worth and self-loathing. He gets that right. David is describing a similar experience in a different way. And I don't know exactly what Ben Affleck has found as a way of working out of that shame. But I'll show you the exit door that David gives us this morning. It's verse 5. I acknowledged my sin to you. Notice, I kept silent. Felt like a 60-pound backpack. I acknowledged my sin to you. He says it again. I did not cover up or I did not cover my iniquity. Notice, before he's saying it's a good thing when God covers your sin and hides it. He says we're not going to talk about that anymore. It's done. It's a different thing for us to cover it and pretend it's not there. So I stopped doing it. It's like I'm coming clean. I'm pushing it all out there. It's all out there. I said I will confess my transgressions to the Lord. And what happened? And the Lord forgave me. And it leads to this radical, revolutionary freedom. So that he then turns to us. And he says, you should do this too. He says, I'm telling you. I know the world says to you. I know the evil one says to you as well. That the best thing you can do for yourself to find joy is just don't tell anybody about it. Just keep it to yourself. Cover it up. Keep up the game. Keep pretending. And eventually you'll kind of figure it out. And David's saying, it's just not going to work. What you need to do is you need to confess. Admit you're a mess. Come clean. And when you come clean, God comes through. He forgives you. And you realize something all along. God has always known about my sin. It's not like I was keeping it from him. And the people around me probably did too. It's not like I was really keeping it from them. It was just an all, a big charade. Unnecessary. And ultimately piling on the shame. And what David is modeling for us here is the need to step out into the light. Into the freedom of the gospel. The freedom of being able to say, I don't have to prove myself to you or to anyone else. I know it's a very anti-DC thing to say, right? Because we're always proving ourselves and justifying our worth and showing how valuable we are to the organization. And God says to you, in my family, you don't have to do any of that stuff. None of it. You are free to be honest. To come clean. To be a mess. It's normal to be a sinner. It's liberating to know that God no longer holds our sins against us. That we can confess to him that we have the righteousness of Jesus. Along those lines and along the lines of what David says here in terms of inviting us into this hiding place. And these words that our hearts would then be humble and teachable. Let me just give you just one quick word of pastoral advice before we wrap up. Just on this point. I found in my own life that I experience the freedom of the gospel. The freedom of forgiveness most fully when I experience it within the context of grace-filled community. And what I mean by that is when I'm not just honest with God. Most importantly, it does involve that. But I'm also honest with other people I trust. So that there are people in my life who know everything. And can ask me anything. And will do it without judgment. You know Francis Schaeffer used to say, Christians of all people should be the least shocked people in the world. Right? Like we've got all the doctrines that tell us that we're a mess. So when someone confesses a sin to you, it shouldn't be. Actually what he says is, the answer should be, me too. So you've got to have those people in your life. And that's why we have community groups to nurture those kind of relationships. That's why we need fellowship. That's why we need to be together. We need to find those confidants, those allies, those brothers and sisters we can just be honest with. Because we will experience. If my experience is anything like yours. We'll experience the liberating power of grace most fully when we experience it together. One of my favorite quotes. You've probably heard it before from the late teacher and theologian Jack Miller. He loved to say this to his students. Cheer up. You're worse off than you think. And cheer up. You are more loved. Than you could possibly imagine. That's why David finishes the psalm the way he does. And as we come to the table this morning. This is my encouragement for us. Be glad. In the Lord. And rejoice. Let's pray. Father. As we come to your table this morning. We pray that you would remind us. Not just with the words preached. But with the words tasted. And seen. The words at this table. That you love us. And that you have given us in giving us Jesus. You have given us the joy. The enduring joy. Of being forgiven. We ask in Jesus name. Amen.
