Well, good morning church family, and again, welcome to McLean Presbyterian Church. My name is Joe Pelakis and I serve as the pastor for young adults here within our church family. And it really is a joy to be worshiping with you all this morning. As we come now to our scripture this morning from the book of Galatians, I want us to step into it with kind of a thought in mind or a question, and it's this, have you experienced, right, a way of living that depends on your performance, right? Have you lived life in such a way that it feels like you are performing more than living? And I ask that question because my answer to it is absolutely. I was raised in a Christian family. I don't know exactly when I fully put my faith in Jesus, but I do remember a particular moment in time when I became very much like the Galatians that Paul is talking to. I remember at one point in high school becoming absolutely terrified by the question of whether or not I was actually saved. And as I was confronted by that question, I didn't run into the gospel of grace like Paul encourages the Galatians to do. I ran exactly where the Galatians ran, towards a false gospel that preaches another way of being saved. Specifically, right, I turned to all sorts of external things to prove to myself, to others, and to God that I deserve to be saved. I thought maybe that would help me feel better about myself. Got really involved in youth group, did all the things I thought a nice Christian young man should be doing. But I was doing all of these things externally and internally. Fundamentally, nothing had changed. I was tempted in the exact same ways I'd been tempted. I sinned in the same ways I'd been sinning. In fact, some of my sinful habits grew worse and more flagrant. And this gap began to open up and I covered it up, right, by feelings of pride and judgment that when I saw other Christians not doing what I was doing externally, I had some thoughts and words for them of, hmm, maybe you're doing this wrong. But I was also terrified, frightened, that if anybody really saw who I was and what was going on in my heart, they would know the truth that I knew. That there was no way that I could do enough to earn salvation. We come now to this passage in Galatians chapter two, and this seems to be a question that Paul has at the front of his mind. Right, this life of performance that I'd been living left me judgmental, prideful, fearful, and exhausted. And Paul said to me, or Jesus said to me through the words of Paul, and Jesus says to us, there's a better way to live. So let's listen to God's word from the book of Galatians, and then we will pray and see how we might understand his word together. This is Galatians chapter two, verses 15 through 21. We ourselves are Jews by faith, but we are also Jews by judgment. We ourselves are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners. Yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law, but through faith in Jesus Christ. So we also have believed in Christ Jesus in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law. Because by works of the law, no one will be justified. But if in our endeavor to be justified in Christ, we too were found to be sinners. Is Christ then a servant of sin? Certainly not. For if I rebuild what I tore down, I prove myself to be a transgressor. For through the law, I died to the law so that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And this life I now live in the flesh. I live by faith in the son of God who loved me and gave himself for me. I do not nullify the grace of God for if righteousness were through the law, then Christ died for no purpose. Friends, this is the word of the Lord. Let's pray. God, our father, we need your help this morning. Left to ourselves, we will mess up the gospel. We will forget. We will misremember. We will exchange the truth for lies. So, father, we ask that you would rescue us from ourselves, that you would point us to Jesus, and you would do this by your spirit even now. In Christ's name, we pray. Amen. If you've been around church for a while, even this church, you'll know that it is a law that a preacher's outline must be three points and alliterated nicely. Well, friends, I have died to that law this morning. We only have two points, and they are hopelessly unalliterated. But it comes from verse 18, what I want us to think through this passage in just a what I want us to think through this passage in just two ways. First, what must be torn down, and second, the foundation we build on. Right? So, what must be torn down and the foundation that we build on. So, first, it's helpful just to recognize that Paul is set on a project of deconstruction. He wants to demolish, to tear down a way of thinking that he says will destroy Christians if we're not careful. And really, what he's pointing to, right, are two errors that he identifies in the life of the Galatians. The first is a reliance on anything other than Jesus to make you right with God. And the second is a reliance on anything other than Jesus to keep you right with God. He sees these as twin errors that must be demolished, that must be annihilated, because if we let them slip into our thinking, we give ourselves over to slavery. We give ourselves over to death. Right? So, let's trace his argument together, beginning in verses 15 and 16 here. He's addressing that first error. He's answering the question, how is somebody made right with God? And he says, Paul says, inspired by the Holy Spirit, that there's only one way. But let's see what his argument sounds like, right? In verse 15, he's continuing a line of thought that he began in verses 11 through 14. So, if you remember from last week, if you were with us, Paul is recounting an argument that he had with Peter, another one of the apostles who had a fundamental misunderstanding about the nature of justification. And justification, right, is just our theological word for understanding what it means to be made right with God. And so, Paul, in verses 15 and 16, is continuing his argument, and he's kind of giving an almost hypothetical way of thinking about this, right? He's saying to Peter, we ourselves, we know this, Peter, that we are Jews by birth. We were born into the covenant of God. We are not like Gentile sinners. And this word sinner is really just a rhetorical flourish that Paul uses to highlight, right, this dichotomy, that within their understanding, there were people born within the people of God and people born without. And to be within, obviously, was a lot better than to be out. But, Paul says, we both know that even though this is true of where we were born, we know that a person is not justified by the works of the law, by doing the law, but one is only justified by faith in Christ, right? Right off the bat, Paul is saying that the life of faith begins not with moral striving or a set of obedience or a performance, right? The life of faith begins by looking at Jesus. You are made right with God initially and foundationally. God will enter into a relationship with you not based on what you've done or what you've accomplished for yourself, but because of what Jesus has done and what he has accomplished for us. But, right, Paul continues, this isn't the only error. How are we made right with God, but how are we kept right with God? And he shifts to addressing this error in verses 17 through 19, and he's doing two things here, right? One, he's shifting to address this error, but he's doing that because of accusations that have come from the group, the Judaizers, right, the troublemakers who have come into Galatia preaching another gospel. And here is what the accusations that they have raised against Paul and the gospel that he's been preaching, right? Accusation number one, by accepting Jesus alone as the basis for salvation, Paul and those like him have thrown off the law. They no longer bear the distinctive marks of God's covenant people, so they must be sinners, right? The Judaizers are saying Gentiles are supposed to become like Jews, but Paul, your gospel is making Jews look like Gentiles. There's a second accusation, though, that's related to that, right? It's not only a problem with how the life of faith begins, but it's how the life of faith continues, right? The Judaizers say, Paul, as you throw off the law as the means for justification, you are clearly abandoning the life of a Christian to licentiousness, to an anything-goes mentality. You've thrown out the law. You have become a sinner. And if Jesus is the one who told you to live this way, then he must be a servant of sin too. You see the logic, right, that they're working into the hearts and minds of the Galatians and, in a sense, in the way that it would appeal to the Galatians and to people like me? It's pretty hard to believe that there's nothing we have to do to earn salvation. I might add it's just as hard, maybe even harder, to believe that there's nothing that you have to do to keep your salvation. And so Paul reacts strongly. He says, this is absolutely not true. These accusations that you are leveling at me and my teaching and my gospel, right, come from a misunderstanding of the law of God. Because, as Paul will explain, and we'll talk about this later in our series in chapter three, but he says that the purpose of the law, it's a very specific and singular purpose. It points us to Jesus. It was never intended as the means for justification. He says, if once we have trusted in Christ and we turn back to the law as a means by which we stay in relationship with him, then we've put ourselves in an impossible place, verse 18 and 19. Right, for if I rebuild what I tore down, I prove myself to be a transgressor. But before we move on, it's helpful to ask, how did this happen? How did the Judaizers come to a place where they so misunderstood the gospel and the law that they would lead others astray? And here's the thing, right, the Judaizers, their chief error was that they had interpreted the scriptures, they'd interpreted the law culturally and not theologically. They had seen the law as a means of cultural enlightenment rather than theological truth. Right, what do I mean by that? Well, for the Judaizers, the cultural interpretation of the law had necessarily led into a gospel message that was Jesus and. And like we said, Paul's going to do a lot of this explanation later on in chapter three, but right now what we can see is that a cultural interpretation of the law yields a law that was more concerned with who is in and who is out than with the redemptive purposes of God. And the end result of that was a misunderstanding, a misconstrual of the nature of salvation itself. And this, I think, is a perennial temptation for the people of God. A more recent theologian than the Apostle Paul, not an apostle, but a guy named Richard Lentz writes this. Too often we force the message of redemption into a cultural package that distorts its actual intentions, or we attempt to view the gospel solely from the perspective of a tradition that has little living connection to the redemptive work of Christ on the cross. Earlier I said that Paul is set on a project of deconstruction, and I used that word very deliberately because you see what Paul is trying to do is pry apart culture and gospel. He recognizes that deconstruction, this process gets it right when it sees the places that we have made our culture, the lens through which review and the standard by which we measure the gospel, as opposed to allowing the gospel to be the lens through which review the standard by which we measure our culture and our lives. And now hear carefully what I'm saying, right? Because we can hear that word culture, and I think a lot of us automatically jump to the culture out there. No, Paul is talking about the culture in here. It's really easy to allow our cultural baggage to modify our understanding of the gospel. Right, Paul here is epitomizing faithful deconstruction. Paul wants to tear down a way of doing Christianity that places our faith, our security, our trust, our way of living in something other than Jesus Christ. And this is so important to him because thousands of years ago, he saw what became experientially true in my life in high school, that if we substitute the gospel of grace for anything else, we live a performance-driven life that leads us into misery. But more than that, we lead a performance-driven life that ultimately drives us to death. Because to rely on anything other than Jesus at any point in our life of faith is to miss the gospel. But the good news this morning is that Paul isn't a nihilist or an anarchist, right, just seeking to tear things down for the sake of tearing things down. No, he wants to expose within us the way that our hearts work so that we might shift our gaze to the only true and firm foundation that we can build a life of faith on. Right, so what is this true foundation to build on? I just want to spend the rest of our time this morning meditating on drinking in the truth of Galatians 2 verse 20. Right, the gospel frees us from the burden of self-justification, of self-righteousness, of self-sanctification, and introduces us to a person who has accomplished the work for us. Right, Paul wants to point us back to the finished work of Jesus. And look at what Paul says about Jesus at the beginning of verse 20 and at the end. He says, Jesus was crucified because Jesus loved me and he gave himself for me. If you've grown up in church like I did, we kind of take a lot of things for granted. Right, we hear certain language or phrases or words and they've lost all power in our lives. And this was true of me regarding Galatians 2 verse 20. I have been crucified with Christ. Friends, the eternal Son of God came down out of heaven and died. Do you recognize how strange that is? That God himself put on flesh not to ride in as a conquering hero, but to ride in as a sentenced and condemned man. But why? Why would this be true? And it's there at the end, because he loved me and gave himself for me. Right, so what is this love that Paul says he has been loved with by Jesus? It's a divine, it's a fruitful, and it's an effective love. And it's helpful to think about this by first comparing it to our lives. Right, so our love typically in our realm of human experience, we feel love in response to something in front of us. Right, if you're in a relationship, dating, engaged, married, your love of your partner first was because you saw something lovely in them. They were attractive. You love that funny joke they told. It was both of those for Mary in mine and Mayer's case, by the way. But there was something initially attractive, right, that drew you in. And you know, right, that after that first attraction, that first response of love, that your love is actually not sufficient to fundamentally change the person that you love. Because after the kind of rose-colored glasses fall off, you start to see their mess and how they're broken and sinful. And no matter how hard or committed you are to loving that person, you can't love sin out of them and you can't love self-worth into them. But Jesus's love is different. Listen to how a 17th century theologian John Owen puts it. He says, We cannot love grace into a child, nor mercy into a friend. We cannot love them into heaven, though it may be the great desire of our soul. But now the love of Christ, being the love of God is effectual and fruitful in producing all the good things which he wills to his beloved. Jesus loves life, grace, and holiness into us. He loves us into the covenant. He loves us into heaven. This is the love that Paul experienced on a road on the way to Damascus. A love that burst into his heart like the sun through the clouds after a rainy day and changed fundamentally everything about him. But how did he know this love was true? It's because, right, not only did Jesus love him, but Jesus gave himself for him. This language, right, the son of God loved me and gave himself for me, that phrase he gave himself is the exact same phrase used in each of the gospels in each of the gospels to describe Jesus being given over to be crucified. Just from John chapter 19, verses 16 through 18. So Pontius Pilate gave Jesus over to them to be crucified. And so they took Jesus and he went out bearing his own cross to the place called the place of a skull, which in Aramaic is called Golgotha. And there they crucified him and with him two others, one on either side and Jesus between them. You see, in his encounter with the risen Jesus, Paul recognized the two fundamental truths of his existence. The first was that he was more sinful than he ever could have comprehended, than he ever would have dared to admit to himself or to others. And that sin required death. But that second glorious reality that took over his heart and his life was that Jesus loved him. Not because of anything lovely or anything he'd accomplished. In fact, in spite of all that Paul had accomplished, did Jesus love him? And so the question for us this morning is what about us? These are great and beautiful words to read about Paul. Good for him that he's had this beautiful experience with Jesus. If you've already closed your Bibles, I invite you to take them back out because we're going to do something a little strange. So I need everybody actually to take out a Bible and turn to Galatians 2 verse 20. It's most helpful if you have the ESV just because that's what we'll read from. But in just a second, we're going to read Galatians 2 verse 20 out loud together. Because what Paul says is that it's not enough to assent to good ideas. It's not enough to assent to a standard of good behavior or a code of ethics. What Paul says is that we must each grasp Jesus by faith. So let's read Galatians chapter 2 verse 20. And as we do, right, allow the Spirit to do work in your hearts. Let's read this together. I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And this life I now live in the flesh. I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me. Friends, you know how easy it is to slip into a performance mentality? Just before this sermon, you know, my biggest fear was being embarrassed and not being liked by you. Not convincing you that I knew what I was talking about. Not convincing you that I had the authority to say any of these things. And guess what? On my own, I don't. On my own, I should be embarrassed to stand in front of you because I am a wretched sinner. With absolutely nothing to stand on that gives me a right to say any of these words to you. But because of the truth of Galatians 2 verse 20, that as I stand here, as I speak, I no longer live this life by myself. I live as one who has been brought into a living, real union with Jesus. So that I can say these words that I say, I say by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me. And guess what? It's the same thing you get to say tomorrow morning when you walk into homeroom. Terrified that somebody is going to find out that secret. That same thing you get to think on Tuesday after your lunch meeting with your boss, when they say yet again, your performance isn't up to snuff. It's the same thing you get to say on Friday night when you've given once again to that temptation that you can't seem to shake. Jesus loved me and gave himself for me. One word we haven't talked about here is faith. Right? We've talked about justification. We've talked about Christ living in us. But we haven't used this word faith, and it seems to be pretty important to Paul. Right? So what is this faith that he talks about? Well, I can answer that in a few different ways. Right? First, it's helpful to look at the answer that a group of Scottish and English pastors gave about 350 years ago. They gave it in a catechism, right? They gave it in a catechism, right? The Westminster Shorter Catechism. And they asked this question, what is faith in Jesus Christ? And this was the answer. Faith in Jesus Christ is a saving grace whereby we receive and rest upon him alone for salvation as he is offered to us in the gospel. Another way of thinking about faith, right, is it's the open and eager hands of a child reaching out to receive a gift. Are these the pictures, the words that you would use to describe your life of faith? Receiving and resting on Jesus. The good news is, is if you need a reminder this morning, we're going to be reminded physically of that at the table in front of me. That just as Paul calls us to receive and rest on Jesus by faith, Jesus gives us tools, gives us physical signs that point us to that reality and confirm it for us. Just as real as this bread is between our teeth and the juice as we drink it, is the love with which Jesus loves you and gave himself for you. Let's pray. Jesus, thank you for this free gift of grace. Lord, you know just how tempted we are to forget this, to ignore it, to misremember it. Would you increase our faith even now? Would you increase our faith even now? So that we might behold your finished work on the cross and really believe these words, that you love me and gave yourself for me. In Christ's name, amen.
