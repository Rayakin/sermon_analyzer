Good morning, everybody. It is so good to see you. My name is Ryan Laughlin. If we haven't met before, I'm the senior pastor here. And as you already know, we are starting a new series in the book of Galatians. I'd love for you to have that in front of you as we walk through these first few verses together. You may be wondering like of all the books in the Bible, all the stories in the Bible. Why Galatians? Well, we're calling it a book, but it's technically a letter like a lot of the New Testament. These are letters, in this case, written by the apostle Paul to a group of churches in an area called Galatia, which is in modern-day Turkey. These were churches that Paul started not long before he wrote this letter, but they'd run into some trouble. And so he is writing them a letter to correct them and to encourage them and to point them back to the gospel. Now, you may have noticed a turn pretty early in this letter and you heard a second ago, a few minutes ago from Bill. This is one of the earliest documents we have in the New Testament, one of the earliest letters. It's pointing to the gospel of grace that we've been singing about for the last few moments. And so you may be wondering like, here's this letter about grace and let's just admit it. It doesn't really start that graciously. I mean, yeah, you get grace and peace to you from God, our Father, Lord Jesus Christ. We get that out of the way. And then in verse 6, it's, I'm astonished. Not that like your theology is a little off. Let's just talk about that. Not, oh, so close. You almost had it. It's no. You have deserted God. Well, welcome to the grace world, everybody. This is what it's about. I mean, there's this underlying anger that, I mean, if we're honest, it's a little off-putting because we live in an age of outrage. We have lots of outrage to go around. Maybe there's anger in our homes or the homes we grew up in. And so we have a very instinctive push away when we hear someone get angry or we hear someone leaning into us with intensity in their voice like Paul does. Or maybe our workplace is just an angry place. Or maybe you've spent just like a little bit of time on the internet and you know, what all of us know, that everyone on the internet is outraged about something. In fact, they're outraged that you're not outraged about what they're outraged about. So you come to church on Sunday, we're talking about grace and all of a sudden Paul comes out of the gate angry. And you're thinking to yourself, Ryan, why are we going to spend the next three months in this letter? I've got all the outrage I need. I just don't need any more. Well, we are going to spend the next three months in this letter. It's going to get better. All right. But Paul begins here because unlike your high school friend on Facebook, he actually has a good reason to be outraged. Listen, he knows these people. I know this is just a book in the Bible, words on a page, but for Paul, these are people he knows, men, women, children. He knows them. He walked into these cities. He preached the gospel of grace. They received it in a way that blew all of them away with God's power and his majesty. He saw these little churches forming, standing up the persecution, leaders rising up and he leaves them in good hands. And then he hears months later that this other group has walked in and begun to undo all the hard work that God has already done in their hearts. And he's angry. In the same way that a parent gets angry when they see one of their children being deceived or pointed in the wrong direction. So yeah, his tone is kind of intense. He uses some strong language, but he's doing it because he firmly believes that the Galatians are in grave spiritual danger. Can you get that? Grave spiritual danger. Now, if someone were to say to you, hey, a friend of mine is in grave spiritual danger. This is where your mind starts going. I'm guessing. Well, what do they do? What do they do? Are they indulging in some secret sin? Are they living a hedonistic lifestyle? Are they living any way they want? Are they sleeping around, drinking too much, partying too hard? Is that it? Well, not in the Galatians case. Actually, if you'd walked into their church and you got to know some of these people, you'd walk away saying these are some of the most moral, upright, biblically serious people I've ever met in my life. Okay, so what is it? Well, are they are they entertaining like philosophies of the day or are they deconstructing their faith? Are they really wondering whether or not they can follow Jesus? Nope, same thing. You would have met them and said these are some of the most zealous committed followers of Jesus. I've ever met in my life. So why is Paul so worked up? Because in the pursuit of religious activity. And moral excellence and spiritual superstardom. They'd lost their grip on the gospel. That's why. They had forgotten the good news about what Jesus had done for them. And now they were beginning to live as if God's acceptance of them was based on all the wonderful things they did for God and not on what Jesus had done for them. And that my friends is the reason we're studying the book of Galatians because that's not just a Galatian problem. That's a McLean problem. It's not just their problem. It's your problem and it's not just your problem. It's my problem because our hearts drift to a works righteousness a self-righteousness this attitude that maybe maybe just God likes me a little bit more when I'm obedient than when I'm not. And Paul says be careful. I'm going to use strong language. I'm going to be a little outraged a little angry to get your attention to let you know that as Christians we can never outgrow the good news of the gospel. And so he takes us back. And he reminds us. How sweet how good how liberating the gospel is for us. Not just someday back in the past. But today kickoff Sunday. Today. Let me pray for us as we open this passage together father. We admit to you that this is our problem to like the default screen of our hearts is. What we do what we've done our record our resume. Help us Lord to remember the goodness of Jesus and the goodness of the gospel. We thank you for this letter from Paul that confronts us and also comforts us. We pray that you would do this work for the glory of your name in Jesus name. Amen. I will tell you that the frustration that Paul feels feels is palpable not just in this first chapter, but the next few chapters as well. So just kind of hold that thought as we go through this the next few weeks, but this frustration is is not just seeking to condemn us or seeking to make us feel bad about ourselves. He's ultimately trying to correct us and direct us and direct our hearts back to the freedom that we have in the gospel. It's like Paul is like a spiritual chiropractor. Okay. He recognizes that that our lives are all twisted and out of a line with the gospel. And so this may be painful for a while. You may hear some unusual noises over the next couple weeks and months, but he is aligning. This is language he uses. He's aligning our lives again with the gospel and he's doing it again in these first. He's doing it right away in these first few verses by just telling us some basic truths about the gospel. So you're going to hear this and you may think yeah gospel 101. I got this. I know somebody who needs to hear this the most dangerous word words ever spoken by anyone listening to a sermon. I know just the person who needs to hear this. Guess what that person's you. So here's what he says about the gospel. First of all, the gospel is true. Secondly, the gospel is unique and the gospel is enough. It's true. It's unique. It's enough. The gospel is true. Now we're going to as we go we're going to describe together or I'm going to describe for you what Paul is the situation Paul is responding to because there's some historical background that really builds throughout the first couple chapters but notice in verse 7 if you will in our passage today that Paul talks about a group of people who are troubling the Galatians. So we think something like this happened Paul plants these churches. He leaves and a few weeks months go by and a group of people come into Galatia. Maybe they were already there, but they come into these churches and they start causing problems. They start stirring up trouble never happens in the church never happens. But in this case it happens to these unfortunate folks and the first thing they attack is Paul's credibility. You can almost imagine the conversation. Paul, who's Paul? Like who does Paul think he is telling you the good news of Jesus? You know, he's not Peter. Yeah, he didn't spend three years with Jesus. He's not James. He didn't grow up in the same house as Jesus. It took James a little while to come around but he came around. He knew Jesus, you know better than most. But Paul, you mean the guy was persecuting the church a few years ago that Paul? You don't think that Paul might now be just subverting the church instead of throwing Christians into prison. Maybe he's just like introducing false ideas to warp your minds and not give you the whole gospel. Tell you what, Paul did a lot of good things, but he didn't tell you the whole gospel. And we know that they were thinking something like that or saying something like that because of the way Paul begins the letter. Paul, an apostle, which just means sent one. An apostle is someone who's sent. And then he clarifies what he means by that. Not from men nor through men, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead. So Paul is saying, I'm not a self-appointed ambassador. You know, some of you have been around diplomatic affairs or been around ambassadors. You know, you can't just like appoint yourself ambassador. You know, you're not Dennis Rodman. You can't just do that and go over and start speaking for the country at random. Like I'm here to talk for the president. Like if you're an ambassador, you have to have documentation. You have to have a letter of credence from the president of the United States. It says the president says that I can speak for the president. You have to have a diplomatic card. You have to have a diplomatic plates. You have to have credentials that say you are qualified. You have authority to speak. And what does Paul say? It's his letter of credence. It is that Jesus himself. Sent him. And notice he emphasizes the risen Jesus and the reason Paul is doing this and he'll do this again later in the letter is because he wants our minds to go back. If we're familiar with the story of Paul becoming a Christian on the road to Damascus. When Paul encountered the risen glorified Christ, you know, sometimes we think that Paul just kind of, you know, was Johnny come lately and he just kind of picked up this Christian stuff later on like maybe Peter and James saw some potential in the sky and pulled him aside. No, the story of Paul is the story of Paul going in one direction and Jesus knocking him off of his horse. The risen glorified Jesus meets him and commissions him to go preach the gospel. So Paul begins by saying, you can trust what I say because Jesus has been raised because Jesus commissioned me to preach the good news. And here's why that's important. It's important for the Galatians who may have been questioning his credentials. It's important for us because it doesn't matter how long you've been a Christian. There are times in your life. When it's hard to believe that the gospel is true. It's hard to believe it's true. Let me put it this way. Sometimes the gospel seems too good. To be true. And Paul's going to say things in this letter that, you know, when we're in church, you're going to kind of go. Yep. Okay. Yeah, good. I got it. You know, yes, I'm an adopted son or daughter of God. God delights in me. He loves me. He even likes me. He actually likes being with me. I am a joy to his fatherly heart. Like we're going to talk about that and because you're in church around other people who are nodding as if they're totally on board, you're going to nod. I'm totally on board. And then like later on in the week, you're going to fail miserably. You're going to be ashamed of what you've done. Of how you've fallen short. How you keep falling back into the same sin patterns over and over again. It's be very easy for you to begin to question whether or not it's really true that there's nothing you can do to make God love you any less and there's nothing you can do to make God love you any more if you are in Christ. I think it's especially that second one that we're just not fully convinced is true. Like we think, sure, I get it. God's love is huge. It's big. He really loves me. He really has forgiven my sins in Christ. It's the other part, right? It's the part that we just think if we did a little better, if we were a little more disciplined, if we had four quiet times this week instead of seven. Or four or two or zero or whatever your number is. If we just improved our performance enough, God would actually love us a little more. And we're going to talk about in a second why that's a problem. And yet here Paul is reminding us out of the gate. The gospel is true. Secondly, the gospel is unique. This is what I mean by that. Every other religion, here's the playbook. All right, the playbook is this. Yep, you're kind of a mess. You're a sinner. You need to atone for your sins. And the way you do that is we're going to give you a long list of things to do. And you just keep doing those things and don't do the thing. Do the things that are on the do list. Don't do the things that are on the don't list. And hopefully the do's outweigh the don'ts at the end of your life. And, you know, hopefully that means that you'll see God and you'll make it to heaven. Or maybe another analogy, every other religion hands you a ladder. So I've got one of those gorilla ladders in my garage. Thing is so cool. Like once I figured out how to do it without breaking my fingers off, things are really cool, right? You like crank it up and move it up. You're like, oh, I know how to get up these rungs. And every religion is like, hey, here's how you move up the rungs to spiritual stardom. Okay, so Islam, you've got the five pillars. In Buddhism, you have the fourfold path. Mormonism, you have the Book of Mormon and on and on it goes. Like here's the ladder. You just start working your way up. So the religion brings you to the bottom of the ladder, hands you the ladder, start climbing. Now Christianity has a ladder too, but here's what's unique. That ladder is not for you to climb. It's for Jesus to come down. Every other religion, your salvation is based on how good a climber you are. But Christianity depends entirely on the fact that God climbed the ladder down in the person of Jesus in order to save us. I mean, think about this. Some people will often point out the dying words of Buddha versus the dying words of Jesus. The dying words of Buddha, strive without ceasing. Strive without ceasing. The dying words of Jesus, it is finished. And Paul gets at this. Actually, he gives us this wonderful little summary of the gospel. I've been using the word gospel for the last 15 minutes and you're like, what is the gospel? Thank you, Paul, for a definition up front, at least a summary of what the gospel is. Verse 3, grace and peace to you. How do we get grace and peace in our lives? It comes from God, from the initiative of our sovereign father and from the substitutionary work of the Lord Jesus who gave himself, who gave himself this radical act of love. Why? For our sins. He took our place on the cross to take the punishment we deserve and to deliver us from the present evil age. Doesn't remove us from the world. We're immersed in the world as salt and light, but we do it with a whole new way of life before us as new creatures in Christ. Those whose lives are no longer dominated by shame and guilt, who are liberated to live lives that are fully human in communion with our father, whose life is an addiction to self, but a life that is addicted to the radical love of God. Removed from this present evil age. How? According to the will of the father, not your idea. You haven't planned this before the foundations of the world. Yet, our father has planned these things from the foundation of the world that you would belong to him so that you would bring glory to him forever and ever. Amen. There's Paul's summary of the gospel. And here's, we're going to walk through this in different ways over the next few weeks. Here's simply what I want you to get. This is what Paul is saying. The gospel, as one person has said, many people have said, probably the gospel is not good advice. The gospel is good news. The gospel is not all the things you have to do in order to make God happy with you. The gospel is the declaration that Jesus has done all of it for you. And we reach out with the empty hands of faith and receive it as if we had done it ourselves. And I clarify that because I think some of us, I think often many of us who grow up in the church, we think that Christianity is basically, like, Christianity is basically about being a good person. Like when you really boil it down, Christianity is about being a good person. We're going to talk about being a good person. There's a place for that conversation. But when you boil Christianity down, it's not about being a good person. It's about being a grateful person. Some of you may have grown up like I did with the, what would Jesus do? Bracelets, you know, up and down your arm. What would Jesus do? And it was a thing back in the day because it was a way to sort of, you know, live a radical life of obedience for Jesus. It actually comes from a book that was written and then it sort of got revised in the 90s and the 2000s. So what would Jesus do? I think for many of us, it's like, yeah, that's like, that question is on the front foot all the time when it comes to our Christian life. Like we're always asking the question, what would Jesus do? Now, I'm not like, I'm not criticizing that question in and of itself. I am criticizing that question by itself because it's actually not the central question of what it means to live the Christian life. The central question is not what would Jesus do? It's what did Jesus do? What did he do? What did he do for you? What does it mean that the God of the universe gave himself for you on the cross out of love to rescue you and bring you into his family and deliver you from this present evil age. Now you get that you can start asking the what would Jesus do question and what's wonderful about Galatians is Paul asks both questions. He just gets them in the right order. And right now he opens a letter by saying what did Jesus do for you Christian don't forget don't don't get butterfingers when it comes to the gospel. Don't you know, don't adorn your arm with what would Jesus do bracelets yet? We'll get there. What did Jesus do? The gospel in that way is unique and finally it's enough. This is really in some ways the heart of the Galatian problem. So now we can talk a little more about these troublemakers verse 7. They're called troublemakers later on in chapter 2. They're called Judaizers before that they're called the circumcision party, which doesn't sound like much like a party to me if you don't you know, but but we'll get to that too. I don't want to steal all that Thunder later on but so this is how this works in Galatia. Most of the people who were converted. They were converted out of a Gentile life. So they were not ethnically Jewish. So they weren't familiar with the Jewish laws or at least they weren't following them in any significant way the troublemakers. These were these were people who came in who converted out of a Jewish background. So think about what this means their whole life. They've been told in order to be accepted by God you have to adhere to the Old Testament law and it's not like they're just gonna like throw that out as soon as they become Christians or wrestling with how is it do these things fit together and a big one like a big marker of what it meant to belong to God's covenant community was circumcision. So all kidding aside for them. It was a really big deal for them to be set apart from the world in that particular way. And so the reason we're given that language and there's all this talk about circumcision in Galatians. Just think of it as a way of summarizing the way that the Old Testament believers understood their faith. And now you have these two communities coming together these troublemakers coming in and this is basically what they're saying. They're saying yeah, of course you need to accept Jesus as Messiah and Savior. Of course you do. Of course you do. But you also have to get circumcised. That's all. Yeah, by the way, if I'm a Gentile convert, I'm thinking that's all like like willing to give up pork if that's what it is, but like that's all like no. So so they're having this they're having this discussion and clearly the Galatians are being persuaded because you know, you can proof text circumcision all day in the Old Testament. They're persuaded. Okay. And in a sense you're like, why wouldn't Paul just say something like, you know? These are overachievers. Yeah, these are people who were just really devout. I mean, they're wrong, but you got to give him credit because at least they're trying right? It's not like they're encouraging something bad or something evil. They're they're trying to tie it to to the Bible and let's just let's just offer a mild correction, but that's not where Paul goes at all. Look at what he says in verse 1 or verse 6. I am astonished. You are so quickly deserting him. That's a strong word. That's language. You use in this culture to talk about soldiers who desert like you're deserting God himself and the gospel. Not that there's another one verse 7 is he's saying like not that they're creating new good news. There's only one good news about Jesus. Not only that he says, but they're distorting the gospel verse 7. He goes on to say in verses 8 and 9. Look, even if an angel came down from heaven in the middle of your church service resplendent and heavenly glory with a lovely booming voice and preached a different gospel kick the angel out. Paul says even if I show up and I've sort of changed my tune a little bit on the gospel and I give you anything but Christ alone and his righteousness alone and his finished work alone. Kick me out. And don't just kick me out. Let me be cursed. I don't think it gets stronger than that. I can't think of a stronger way to say it. This isn't a minor issue when you add to the finished work of Christ. You don't get a better gospel you get no gospel. Here's why. Because what you've essentially done is you set up a ladder for yourself. And you said, yeah, you know, Jesus got me to the bottom of the ladder and now my job is to climb like there's no tomorrow. Because Jesus may have gotten me into God's good graces, but I have to keep myself in God's good graces by working hard enough, being disciplined enough, serving enough at church, coming to church enough, being loving enough, having enough family devotions with my kids on and on and on it goes whatever list is appealing to you. Circumcision is not a list. Totally get that. But like all the other things that sound so good that are so good. But when you add them to the gospel, it's not an improvement. It destroys it completely. Because what you've created is a relationship with God that ultimately depends on you. And isn't there just like a little bit, a little bit part of us. I know I'm talking to people who aren't really driven or, you know, ambitious. Yeah, let's just say imagine yourself to be such a person. Isn't there just like a little bit of us that would love to take a little credit for how put together we are and just we just have a little more figured out. We're a little further along. Paul says, no, no, because when you do that, you are sucking all of the joy and all of the peace right out of your life because you're either going to be a proud person because you're doing really well or you're going to be a despairing person because you're not doing well and you will just oscillate between the two and you will lose the joy. And here's the word that Paul loves to use later, the freedom of belonging to Jesus and having all of your sins forgiven, no work you have to do and the righteousness of Christ given to you, nothing you can do to improve on that. And as we're going to see as we go along, there is so much freedom that we haven't even experienced yet when you just breathe in the gospel oxygen. So some of you are saying to yourself, this is all really kind of confusing. Ryan seems really kind of worked up. Paul really seems worked up. I'm not really sure what this gospel stuff is. Why does what Jesus did 2,000 years ago make any difference to me today and what I'm what I'm dealing with my relational problems, my work problems, just like, you know, my addiction problems on and on. Like I don't really understand it. Good, good, good, good, good, good. Come back. Let's talk. Paul's just getting started. Come back. Others of you are saying, Ryan, I love the fact that you're doing this for everybody. I love it. You know, I love that. I'm part of a church that does this. Just it's edgy or so. I don't know. No one's ever called me edgy in my life. Or you for that matter, just so you know, here we are. I love the fact that you're that we're doing this. This is so good. Like I went through Sonship like 20 years ago. It's really important. Great. I don't know if this is a true story or not, but someone wrote it down. Someone once came up to the reformer Martin Luther and said to him, Martin, why do you preach the gospel of grace every single week? And he said, because you forget it every single week. All right. So that's what I'm saying to you. Come back to Gospel 101 realizing you never really graduate from that class. Because the gospel is true. Will you believe that with me over the next few months? The gospel is true. It's anchored in what Jesus has done once and for all for all who trust in him. The gospel is unique. It gives you a freedom. And as we'll see in Galatians 5 more than just freedom, joy, peace, patience. And the gospel is enough, which means when you're in Christ, you're enough. You're enough for the Lord. He, he likes you and loves you. Even on the days you can't stand yourself. Paul's worked up because he loves you. He loves me. And he wants us to experience the radical grace of Jesus. Father, we thank you for this book. We thank you most of all for this opportunity to remember the grace and peace that can only come from you. Give us the humility to be helpless beggars. Lord, give us the courage to be vulnerable with you and with one another to recognize we indeed are poor in spirit. And the only riches we have are the riches that we have in Christ. And we pray these in Jesus name and God's people set together. Amen.
