Well, good morning once again. It is good to be with you this morning. And we are looking at 1 Corinthians chapter 10 as we start a new series. This morning, for the last year or so, we've been walking through the gospel of Mark and taking a close look at Jesus that culminated last week when we celebrated the death and resurrection of Jesus and all that means for us and all of the ways that answers the deepest longings of our hearts. And so for the next few weeks, what we're going to do is we're going to continue that conversation into more of a corporate setting as we think about what that good news about Jesus has to say about who we are as a church, how it forms and informs who we are as McLean Presbyterian Church. And so we're going to take some time over the next few weeks and walk through our church's mission statement, which if you were here when we first started, Micah mentioned, but you can find it not just now, but forever, at least as long as we have this one on the front of your bulletin. And so I'm going to read it for us and we're just going to take it piece by piece over the next few weeks and understand where these things come from in Scripture. So you'll see it there at the bottom of the front of your bulletin. We exist to glorify and enjoy God by making disciples who make a difference through grace-filled worship, community, and mission. All right, the first and most important thing you need to know about that mission statement is that it is wholly, completely, and intentionally unoriginal. I'm sure somebody at some point thought a lot about how to put it in words, but this is completely plagiarized. This is what we believe the Bible teaches the church ought to be about. And so the language here is not something we just came up with as we have looked at what God says the church ought to be. We've tried to capture that in words. And that first phrase is guilty of even more plagiarism because it's not just ripped off from Scripture, it's actually ripped off from the Westminster Shorter Catechism, which we recited just a moment ago. That first question, what is the chief end of man, which is the 17th century way of saying, why are you here? Okay, not just like here, but why are you here on this planet? Why are you taking up oxygen? Why are you taking up space? What's the point of your life? Why do you exist? And Christianity's answer to that is you exist as a human being to glorify and enjoy God. So we kind of thought that would be a good way to start. Like if that's the reason you exist, that's the reason we exist together, that everything we do ultimately aims at glorifying and enjoying God. Now, that's something that Paul says in this passage. You had to work some to get there, but we eventually ended up in verse 31 of chapter 10, whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, you do all to the glory of God. So this morning, I want to talk about what in the world that means. What does it mean to make your life all about glorifying and enjoying God? Because if someone were to stop you this week and ask you the question, complete this sentence, I exist to, what would your answer be? I exist to be happy, to be successful, to take care of my family, to excel at my work, to make a difference in the world. Maybe you have no idea how you would answer that question or fill in that sentence. And so what I want to do this morning is let the Apostle Paul take this one for a test drive to begin to think together about what it would look like for you to make your life purpose glorifying and enjoying God and for us as a church to do that together. So that's what we're going to talk about. I'm going to pray for us and we're going to jump in. Father, we thank you for your word. We thank you that you haven't remained silent or aloof or distant, but you have revealed who you are, that we might know you and that in knowing who you are by your Holy Spirit, that we might give you glory and we might find our deepest joy in you. Help us to do that even now in Jesus' name. Amen. Okay. What does it mean to eat food to the glory of God? Chew with your mouth closed, definitely on the list. Amen. All right. Only eat holy food like bagels. Nope. Okay. What does it mean to drink to the glory of God? Okay. Don't drink excessive alcohol, certainly would be a good start. Don't slurp your coffee. Drink lots of water. What's on that list? Even as I'm saying that, you're realizing it's probably a little more than good manners and good morals. Paul is after something deeper and more profound and basic than just behaving well when you are at the table. You would be right. To understand why you're right, your instinct is, that sounds right. Okay. The reason your instinct is correct is we have to understand what Paul's talking about and why he's talking about food at all. So 1 Corinthians, it's a letter written by the Apostle Paul to Christians in the city of Corinth. And we think he's responding to a letter that they wrote him. And in that letter, there were lots of questions. They were new Christians. So they had all kinds of questions about what it meant to live a Christian life in a very pagan, pagan, pagan place. And so here's one of the moral dilemmas that they had. They would go to the market and they would buy meat at the market and they would take it home. And they would all of a sudden have this crisis of conscience, not knowing where this meat came from. And this wasn't like a vegetarian, organic, free range chicken kind of thing. It wasn't that so much. The issue is this, because Corinth was a pagan city, like most cities in the Greco Roman world, they worshiped all kinds of gods. Some of the gods you learned about in school, like Hermes and Aphrodite and Zeus and lots and lots of others. And so if you were a pagan living in that city and you had some big decision coming up or some big event in your life, and you wanted the gods to look favorably upon your business transaction or the child that's about to be born or the voyage you're about to take, you would make a sacrifice at the temple on the corner or the little pagan shop on the corner. And you would offer the sacrifice and you'd feel like, all right, I made the gods happy. I can go and do my business. And that happened so often in places like Corinth that there was a lot of leftover meat. The priests would take some and then they would take some out the back door and sell it in the market. And it's not like they marked it like this food has been sacrificed to an idol. You just buy it. And so the Christians are beginning to wonder like, are we participating in pagan worship if I go and eat a burger that was sacrificed to Zeus? Okay, live question. Now, Paul's been answering this question since chapter eight. And I like you guys, so we're not going to go back to chapter eight and work all the way back to chapter 10. I'll just tell you, here's the answer. The answer he gives in chapter 10, he kind of gives it in chapter eight as well. But it's basically this, verse 25, eat whatever is sold in the meat market and don't you worry about it. Why? Well, because as he says in chapter eight, the idols are nothing. There is one true living God. He owns it all. He makes it all. He sustains it all. He owns it all as the king of creation. And so go ahead and eat and don't stress out about it. Unless, so he gives an exception, unless one of your unbelieving friends invites you over for dinner. Interesting side note, it was a normative in Paul's mind that Christians would have friends who are unbelievers and they'd go over to their house for a barbecue. For Paul, that was normal. So he's describing a normal situation. Your unbelieving friend invites you over for a barbecue and you're on the back deck and he's grilling up some burgers. And he happens to say to you, by the way, just so you know, this meat was sacrificed to an idol. And not only any idol, this meat was sacrificed to Zeus. Like you are getting premium, 100% Zeus burger. That's how much I love you. Not only because it's going to fill your stomach, he's implying, but because it's going to do you a cosmic favor because it's Zeus after all. And in that case, Paul says, you should probably pass. Why? Not because of your conscience, the meat's fine, but because of the conscience of your neighbor. The fact that he went out of his way to tell you suggests that he actually thinks there's something different about this meat and you don't want to participate or compromise yourself in that way. You got it? That's a long way around back to verse 31. But it's important because we need to understand that this idea of glorifying and enjoying God is not this abstract religious concept that we talk about for a few minutes on Sunday and then we put it on the shelf and we go live our lives. This is a concrete concept, an earthy principle that informs how you shop for groceries and what you grill at the barbecue and what you think about the world and everything in it. Because Paul says this doesn't just have to do with what you eat and drink, it has to do with everything you do, he says, ought to be for the glory of God. So how do we do that? Our outline, our path couldn't be simpler this morning, I just want to talk about what it means to glorify God and what it means to enjoy God and hopefully persuade you that these are ideas that you can take with you and apply to your life and find great joy in doing so. All right, so what does it mean to glorify God? It helps just to know what the word glory means here in verse 31. The word translated glory into English out of the original Greek is the Greek word doxa, where we get our word doxology, you know that one, praise God, from whom all blessings flow. And so to glorify God in a very basic sense means to praise him, means to give honor to him, we might say to give credit where credit is due. And I just want you to know, you do this all the time, you can't help but do this, whether you know it or not. For example, if you go to the baseball game and it's a close game and a ball goes over the fence, home run, like no one has to coach you to stand up and cheer, like no one is saying at that moment over the loudspeaker, let's make some noise, right? Because everybody's already making noise, already spontaneously standing up and cheering and clapping and high-fiving strangers and acting like a lunatic. It just happens. I mean, no one has to tell you at the end of the 4th of July, firework display, when all of the fireworks are going off at the same time for you to start applauding and going, ooh, ah, like no one has to tell you to, you just, it comes out of you. No one has to tell you when the band finally comes out, your favorite band finally comes out on the stage and the lights start coming up and they start playing your favorite song, no one has to tell you to go crazy. Why? Because something inside of you is hard wired to see something glorious, something you admire, something you love, something that stirs you and you give praise. And often loud enough that other people hear and in such a way that you're inviting other people to join you, like, did you see that? Did you hear that? You've got to watch that. Someone probably told you that this week. You've got to watch that show. You've got to go to that restaurant. You've got to, you've got to, I have to, you have to. What are they doing? They want you to join it, it is so good. You just don't understand, it's so good. So what does it mean to glorify God? Well, Paul is just picking up on this very human impulse. You know, the animal kingdom doesn't do this, okay? Otters don't rate each other as they slide down. You know how cute they are when they're swimming around and sliding down? They're not holding up scorecards, you know, 9.8, 9.9. We do, like, we're obsessed with giving scores for magnificence and performance. Why? Because we are hardwired to see glory and praise it. And all Paul is saying is, you were made to do that, but not just for the stuff that you see, but for the one who made all the stuff. You can see you were made to glorify, to give praise to, to point to God, the all-glorious one, and say, that's not awesome. Don't you want to see how awesome he is? That's not awesome. Don't you want to see how awesome he is? When do we do that? Well, you're doing it now. Congratulations. But is this the only time we do it? From, you know, 9.15, you know, to 11.45, I'm just kidding, till 10.15, something like that? Maybe you add on Ace, maybe you go to a community group, and that's it. Are those the boundaries of glorifying God? No. What does Paul say? Just to remind you, whatever you do, all the time, not just with your mouth, but with your body. As Paul says in Romans chapter 12, we offer our bodies as living sacrifices. The way we use our bodies in all things is an act of worship. There is no off switch. There's no off time. There's no off duty. The duty, the chief purpose of your life all the time is to give glory to God. Why? Paul tells us why. Verse 26, for the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof. That's from Psalm 24. He's just quoting Scripture to us and is reminding us that the reason we ought to glorify God in all things, at all times, with every part of our being and every part of our body is because God deserves it. Because he deserves it. Psalm 29, skip a couple pages from Psalm 24, you get to Psalm 29, and we read these words there, ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name. Now, King David, who wrote those words, that's prompted by this reflection on the created order. And so, if you keep reading in that Psalm, you see that David seems to be looking at a thunderstorm approaching and he hears the rumbling thunder and he sees the flashing lightning, or he's looking at the ocean, the crashing waves and the vast depths of the ocean, and it stirs him to say, give God credit, glory, honor, praise, because look how glorious he is. It's like David has this zeal, almost this jealousy that God get the credit because he's that amazing. I mean, think about it this way. If you had a friend, say you had a friend who was a scientist and she made this amazing discovery, this breakthrough discovery, but she doesn't get any credit for it. Or worse yet, someone else takes credit for what she worked so hard to discover, spent years of her life doing. Someone else takes the credit. How are you going to feel for your friend? You're going to feel like, wait a second, wait a second, that's not right. That's not just like the person who did the work, the person who is this amazing should get the credit for the work that she did. And that's how David feels about God, that he needs to get the credit. The question we ought to ask ourselves as we hear that is, is this our heart for God? Do we have a passion that God get more glory because he deserves it? Or do we follow that ancient, sinful, selfish impulse inside every human heart that we need the glory? That's the question that Paul's laying out for us. It's a basic question of existence, purpose, meaning in your life. Is the basic purpose of your life that God receive glory or that you receive glory? Now, some of you are thinking, okay, yeah, I mean, that makes sense. I can see why based on what Paul says here is that God should receive the glory. That makes sense as a way to live, but that actually sounds kind of miserable. I mean, it sounds like kind of a dreary and dull life if all you're doing all the time is like deflecting glory, deflecting glory, deflecting glory. In fact, I've met some people who have made it their job to make this way of life look really bad. I've met people who, for example, offered a compliment after someone gave a lecture one time. I said, that was really good. And this person couldn't stop almost apologizing for it being good. Oh, you know, God got the glory. God did it. I was like, well, I mean, you did it. And I think it's okay to just say, thank you so much. That means a lot. I mean, to receive a compliment is not sinful. To appreciate a compliment isn't sinful. To want people to appreciate the work you do, I don't think that's sinful, but there is a line we cross at some point. It's not just a matter of appreciating those things. We get to the place in life sometimes where we need those things. And that's when things start going wonky. But I don't think what Paul is describing is dreary or dull at all. I mean, does that look dreary or dull to you? Not at all. That's on purpose. The journalist H.L. Mencken once wrote about Puritans. Maybe you've heard this quote before. I think this applies to what many people think about Christians these days. He described Puritans as people who are consumed with the haunting fear that someone somewhere may be happy. And I think sometimes that's what we think about what it means to glorify God, like all glory to God. It's a very dour, stern, stoic way of life. I don't think that's what Paul is describing at all. Let me explain, just give a couple of reasons why that's true. First of all, because Paul is giving us permission in this passage. This is a permission-giving passage. Now, there are other passages where Paul says, yeah, don't do that. But here's a passage where Paul is saying, do do that. What is he saying? Eat, enjoy. And he's speaking specifically to stressed-out Christians, Christians who are terrified that they're going to mess up somehow. Paul, what if we get this wrong? What if we get this wrong? Paul says, relax, enjoy a burger, dude. Just eat, drink, enjoy the fact that you get to live in your father's world and he gives you good things. Enjoy. Now, it's not unbridled liberty, is it? He talks about his liberty in verse 29. Why should I curb my liberty if someone just like has a problem with what I'm doing? He says, I'm free in Christ, but it's not unbridled freedom. And we don't have time to go into all the exceptions he names here and other places. But it's important to mention because of the culture we live in, which tends to take freedom, which understands freedom basically as like I get to do whatever I want. That's not what Paul's saying. Because Paul bridles, curbs his freedom out of love for God and love for neighbor, even unbelieving neighbor. It's really interesting. He's saying, yeah, there's certain things I'm not going to do because I don't want to offend my unbelieving neighbor. Wow. Okay. But the basic principle here is you have permission to enjoy the good things that God gives you. Stop hitting the brakes. Start hitting the gas. You're free in Christ, Paul's saying. And at the same time, Paul says, I'm not just giving you permission, I'm giving you a pathway. So what I mean by that is in looking at verse 30, Paul says that he partakes presumably in food and drink and everything else with thankfulness, with gratitude. In other words, Paul receives good things in his life, but he sees them as a pathway to understand the goodness of God. It's as if he looks through the good things in life. The pleasures that God gives us. The fact that God has made a world where everything doesn't taste like gravel. That's good. That's good. And we look through that and we begin to enjoy not the thing itself, ultimately, but God himself. This is part of what it means to live a doxological life. It means you realize that as you give praise to God, you're giving praise to the one in whom your deepest joy resides. That our joy is not just...our joy doesn't terminate in the created order, it looks through the created order at the one who made all things and who is glorious and majestic and kind and good and holy. So even as we enjoy good things with gratitude, we're ultimately enjoying God himself. I'll just give you an example of this. This past week, I saw an article in the Washington Post about sunsets. I don't know if you saw this article. Groundbreaking research out of the UK. The results published in the Washington Post this week. Here, after years of research, here is the finding. People love sunsets. I know. And no, no, hold on a second. More than clear blue skies, more than the nighttime sky, even more than rainbows, people love sunsets. And I kept reading. I'm like, there's got to be more to this article and this research than people love sunsets. There's not. That's it. That was the research. And we can do better than that. All right. Paul tells us we can do better than that. Paul says, just go read Psalm 19 and realize that, yes, you love sunsets. That's good. But the sunset is leading you into a deeper joy because the sunset is an example of what Psalm 19 tells us, which is the heavens declare the glory of God. That's why John Calvin described all of creation as a theater of God's glory. That's why Psalm 104 encourages us when we see the sun setting to remember that from the rising of the sun to the setting of the sun, may the name of the Lord be praised. That is, as you watch the sun go down, you realize it's going up somewhere else in the world. And in that place too, there are people God has called to himself from every tribe and nation who call upon the name of the one true God. What a glorious thought. How big is God? How majestic, how good that he's creating a multi-ethnic, multi-generational family. How beautiful is he? Or we can think of Revelation 21, where we're told in the new heavens and new earth, when Jesus makes all things new and sets all things right in that land, that forever home of God's people, there will be no sun. Why? Because the Lord himself will be our light and the lamb will be our lamp. How good and gracious and sovereign and majestic and creative and powerful is our God. This is where our joy leads. It's a pathway to deeper joy, joy that is found only in knowing God. And so the second question, are you enjoying God? Not that these things are exclusive from enjoying God, but just understand the distinction I'm making. Not just thinking about him, not just obeying him through gritted teeth, not just singing about him, not even just praying to him, but enjoying him as you do all of those important things. Enjoying God. Are you enjoying God? We're going to talk much more about this in the weeks to come as to how we actually work this out. So besides running out of time, I also don't want to just say things we're going to say later, because we're going to talk about how we do this in worship and community mission and all that. Let me just give you just a few takeaways from us as an institution. What does it mean for us to begin our mission statement with those words? Let me just mention a few things. First of all, I hope this demystifies, if you're mystified, demystifies what we're all about as a church. We really believe it is better that God get glory than us, so that when you leave on Sunday or when you leave on Sunday or when you leave your community group or when you leave one of our mission projects, our hope and prayer and goal is that you would leave marveling at how great God is, not how great we are. And some of you are like, yeah, you don't have to worry about that. That's fine. I just want to make that clear. That is a guiding question. We don't always get it right, but that is where our heart is. We are committed to glorifying God and enjoying him together. Secondly, I hope this clarifies why we often say this is a place we intentionally want skeptics and non-Christians to come and to feel welcome, not to feel like, wow, you should really feel privileged to be here. I hope you feel privileged. No, like really well, like you are welcome. Your questions are welcome here. Why? Because if our deepest desire is for God to get more glory, we want him to get more glory. If our deepest joy is in God, we want other people to experience that joy. And you see the same impulse in Paul when he says at the end of this passage, I don't want to offend anybody. I'm not going out of my way to offend anybody. I want to please them in everything I do. Why? So that they might be saved. So Paul's logic is there as well. And then thirdly, I hope this explains why we talk about Jesus so much. Like why is every sermon about Jesus? Well, here's the reason. Because the clearest display of God's glory is not the Grand Canyon as pretty as awesome. I mean, that's as advertised, right? That's pretty amazing. You know, it's not sunsets. We all love sunsets. Apparently it's not sunsets. The clearest display of God's glory, the Bible tells us, John chapter 12 is the cross. Where the God of glory laid aside his glory to take your shame upon himself. Like if you're looking through the Bible, like where do I see God's glory most clearly? The Bible would say, you look at Jesus, the Lord of glory on the cross, setting it all aside, laying it all aside for you. And for me, there's nothing more glorious and more beautiful and more revealing about the character of God than that moment. And so, yeah, we talk about it a lot. In fact, Paul ends here. If you noticed, he says in verse one of chapter 11, be imitators of me as I am of Christ. Because Paul understands that if we are really going to make our life as individuals and as a church about glorifying and enjoying God, it starts and it ends with Jesus who gave up his life that we might be fully alive in him. Let me pray for us. Father, we thank you that you have given up your glory for us in Jesus. We thank you also that we have the hope of future glory that day when, Lord Jesus, you will return. And until that day, Lord, give us faith, perseverance, courage to do what is right, to speak what is true, to love what is beautiful. We pray it all in Jesus' name. Amen.
