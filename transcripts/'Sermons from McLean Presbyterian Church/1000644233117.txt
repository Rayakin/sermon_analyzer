Good morning. My name is Terrence Little, and I serve here at McLean as Pastor of Ministries. It is a joy and a privilege to be with you all here this morning. If you're here with us for the first time today, we are in a sermon series entitled The True and Better Story. As some of you know, I love books and movies. If you come to my office downstairs, you'll see I have lots of books down there that they like to make fun of me, but I can take it. Books and movies tell us stories, stories that sweep us up into a storyline, a drama, a comedy, action, or mystery, a narrative seeking to catch and keep our attention. In the 21st century, social media writes new narratives and storylines almost minute by minute, expressing what this or that person thinks, believes, desires, supports, likes, or dislikes, all the while advocating what they believe, what they think should be the storyline or worldview everyone needs to follow. In our series, we have looked at God, the Trinity, creation, the image of God and gender, the image of God and dignity, which brings us to today, diversity, diversity, a word loaded with meaning in our world, in our news, in our schools, in our laws, and in us. The branches of diversity and what it looks like are way too numerous for us to name or to dive into today. Today, we focus on human diversity, human diversity and the image of God. I invite you to open your Bibles to Genesis chapter one, verses 26 to 31. And I'm also going to read from Acts 17, verse 26 through 28. You can also follow along with the scripture passage up here on the wall behind me. Genesis chapter one, starting at verse 26, reading to verse 31. Then God said, let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth. So God created man in his own image. In the image of God, he created him, male and female, he created them. And God blessed them. And God said to them, be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth. And God said, behold, I've given you every plant and every yielding seed that is on the face of all the earth and every tree with seed in its fruit. You shall have them for food. And to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I've given every green plant for food. And it was so. And God saw everything that he had made and behold, it was very good. There was evening, there was morning, the sixth day. Acts chapter 17, starting at verse 26. And he, God, made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods in the boundaries of their dwelling place that they should seek God in the hope that they might feel their way toward God and find him. Yet God is actually not far from each one of us. For in him we live and move and have our being as even some of your own poets have said. For we are indeed his offspring. This is the word of the Lord. Thank you, God. Would you pray with me? Our father and our God, please make your truth plain to us. Please show us how to delight in you and in your creation rightly. Please open hearts that do not know you today to see your magnificent glory. Please teach us through your word and Holy Spirit. We ask in Jesus' name, amen. We gather here today in a church as part of the great story of human life, existence, and purpose. We gather today whether you believe in God or not as a part of the grand narrative that the God of the Bible who created the universe is riding and ruling over. The Bible makes the claim that all human beings are a part of God's story which we call the Christian world and life view. There are four chapters to this worldview, to this metanarrative of human life and its dignity and diversity. And we begin with chapter one. Chapter one, beauty, beauty. The creation of human diversity begins with God. Human diversity is God ordained and God designed. Genesis, the first book of the Bible explains how the universe, the earth, and human life began. The all wise, all knowing, all powerful, ever present God who by the way never had a beginning spoke the universe into existence. He formatted the heavens, the oceans, the seas, and the earth according to his specific design. He fashioned this tremendously magnificent globe, this planet earth, this great sphere rotating out in space right now just for us. After the creation of the heavens and the earth, plants, and animals, the last to be created is the crown of God's creation, mankind. Why do you say that? No other part of creation, not even the angels are said to be made in the image of God, none other. The Bible calls the first man Adam or Adam which means man or mankind. And from man, from Adam, God made woman. God made mankind male and female and he made them in the image of God. And here we see that the first instance of God designed humanity, human diversity is male and female. The Bible teaches that the existence of the human race is not an accident. Human beings did not haphazardly emerge as a result of chance or random events. The only sovereign, all powerful, all wise God, purposefully designed mankind for this world. Chapter one shows us that God formed all mankind from one man. He began with one man. Genesis one shows us God creating mankind as male and female. And Genesis two shows the order of the creation of male and female. Genesis two shows God beginning all of humanity starting with one man, Adam. I'm gonna read Genesis two verse seven. Then the Lord God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and the man became a living creature. The apostle Paul preaching in Athens, Greece. Philosophers all around, brilliant people all around if you will, people coming up with their own world views and this is what he says to them. And he, God, made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place. Every nation of mankind started from one man. Amazing, you can't see my manuscript but I put up here, amazing, absolutely amazing. And by the way, you will note that Adam's color is nowhere listed in the entire Bible, did you know that? Isn't it interesting? In a world and a country where we make so much of what our skin color is and in the book that has revolutionized human history, the most, the best selling book in all of history when it speaks of the first man, it never says what his color is. Of our first parents, J. Daniel Hayes notes this, Adam and Eve are not Hebrews or Egyptians or Canaanites and they became the father and mother of all peoples. Every color of human being began with the making of one man, Adam. And from Adam and Eve came the DNA, the God-designed DNA to generate every color represented in the human race. Middle Eastern, Asian, African, European, European, North, Central and South America and on and on, all share the same first parents. That is the scripture's claim. In chapter one, we see that God delights in his creation. Genesis one, verse 31, God saw everything that he had made and behold, it was very good. God takes pleasure in his creation. In the book of Job, as God reveals his power and his wisdom to the suffering man, Job, God speaks of the weather, the oceans, the animals with striking detail, demonstrating that God is thoroughly acquainted with all that he has made, yet only man is made in God's image. God loves the diversity in all of his creation. God loves all of the different skin colors of people. I was in a seminar several years ago, we were online, it was during the pandemic, it was before I came here and the subject of race and color came up and the professor made the comment, I sometimes use the argument that I don't see color and several other classmates shared their thoughts and when my perspective was asked, I said, I never use that argument and the professor said, why? I said, because God gave me the color of my skin just as he gave you yours. Why in the world would I ever be ashamed or want to change the color of my skin? God's plan for humanity is obedience and righteousness and justice in right relationship with God, which necessarily will affect how we relate to each other. But daily, we see how men, women, boys and girls live in the opposite direction. This leads us to chapter two. Chapter two, brokenness. Brokenness, the fall radically affected human diversity because Adam and Eve disobeyed God in Genesis chapter three, the consequence of death, which God promised would occur, came into the world affecting each and every one of us through sin, sin. Sin is the reality that we miss the mark and we fall short of what God created us to be, which is in right relationship to God. Genesis chapter 10 teaches us the establishment of nations after the lineage of Noah and his children and in Genesis 11, we see God's judgment when God confuses the languages and scatters the nations across the earth because of the sin of the people. History, history repeatedly shows us men sinning against men. Cain killed his brother Abel and became the first murderer. The people of Israel were oppressed as slaves in Egypt under the tyranny of Pharaoh. Wars have plagued civilizations for centuries. Tribes fighting against tribes. One ethnic group seeking dominance over other ethnic groups. I am old enough to remember the genocide, the genocide tragedy that occurred in Rwanda where around 800,000 people, mostly Tutsis, were killed by the Hutus. The USA is an incredible country and one that I'm happy and proud and thankful to God that I live in. And yet the history of the United States is littered with men sinning against men. Slavery was a tremendous stain on the history of this great nation, as was segregation. The treatment of the Native Americans was atrocious. Asian Americans fought and served in wars for this country as far back as the Revolutionary War and the Civil War while also enduring segregation. And yet much of that reality has been left out of the annals of history in this country. Sin in people leads to sinful thoughts, laws, and actions regardless of one's color. In chapter two, we are all born into sin. In pursuing a segregated life, laws were actually formed in this country where water fountains and public restrooms were established so that a person of one color did not drink from the same fountain as a person of another color. Men formed laws based on so-called race. And the longer you're around me, you'll figure out that I'm not a fan of that term race as it is used in our modern times because we all bleed red blood. And regardless of skin color, black, white, Asian, Indian, Australian, Romanian, Pakistani, any of us can all share the same blood type. Isn't God amazing? My problem with this sermon today, y'all, will be that I want to stop and keep talking, but I got to keep going. When organ donors are needed, the color of your skin is not one of the criteria. Did you know that? Blood type and body size are two of the major criteria. Not only did our government legislate laws permitting such a culture, many, many churches supported the laws of slavery and segregation, bringing incredible dishonor to the reality of God-ordained and God-designed human diversity. And I don't say that to make people feel bad, but the older I get, I realize, yeah, we have to be honest about history, we do. And yes, we must repent of it, but we'll get there, amen. Apartheid, meaning apart-ness, was established in South Africa in 1948 to create legalized segregation between whites and non-whites. My grandfather told me that there's a time in our own hometown when he had to go to the back of a restaurant and put his hand through a window to get his takeout order because he was not allowed to go into the front of the restaurant and sit down because of the color of his skin. Why? Why? Because of sin. Because of sin. Not because of another person's color, but because of sin, amen. And church, apart from the intervention of almighty God, mankind perpetually sins against mankind, every ethnic group, every tribe. And we have good news. Chapter three, chapter three, building, building through redemption, redemption. And when you hear the word redemption, think buying back. Through redemption, King Jesus begins making all things new, including the good of human diversity for his kingdom. Purposes. In chapter three, which is the chapter we live in, redemption, building, divine redemption breaks into history in an unprecedented way, changing men, women, boys, and girls from the inside out in all kinds of ethnicities. In chapter three, Jesus Christ mercifully intervenes in the sinfulness of man against man. John chapter three, verse 17, Jesus says this. For God did not send his son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Jesus is the new man, the last Adam. And he comes to make men new. Jesus came to make things right. Jesus came to inaugurate, establish, and build his kingdom. Remember that, remember that as we go into the future. Jesus came to build his kingdom. And that kingdom is being built in these United States, in the other continents across this world, and will continue until he returns. I'm getting ahead of myself. Consider Matthew four, verses 15 to 17. The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles, the people dwelling in darkness have seen a great light. And for those dwelling in the region and shadow of death, on them a light has dawned. From that time, Jesus began to preach saying, repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. The kingdom of heaven is present with the person of Jesus Christ. Consider Jesus and the Samaritan woman. In John chapter four, Jesus makes time to talk with a Samaritan woman. The Jews of Jesus's day despised the Samaritans and considered them half breeds. Jesus, a Jew, talks with the woman of Samaria. And he offers her the water of everlasting life. Consider the example of the gospel's impact on Jews and Gentiles in Rome. The apostle Paul wrote his letter to the church at Rome in order to prepare the Gentile Christians for the return of the Jewish Christians to Rome. The emperor Claudius had died, and his edict which kicked the Jews out of Rome in 49 AD died with him. And to the church at Rome, composed of Gentile and Jewish Christians, Paul writes this in Romans 15. For I tell you that Christ became a servant to the circumcised, the Jews, to show God's truthfulness in order to confirm the promises given to the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and in order that the Gentiles, non-Jews, in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written, therefore, I will praise you among the Gentiles and sing to your name. And again, it is said, rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people. And again, praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all the peoples extol him. And again, Isaiah says, the root of Jesse will come, even he who arises to rule the Gentiles. In him will the Gentiles hope. After the resurrection, Jesus tells his disciples in Acts chapter one, verse eight, but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses, where? In Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria, and to the end of the earth. You all, the New Testament church and the early church, were incredibly ethnically diverse. Take some time this week and read Acts chapter two and notice the different ethnicities present and the different languages all brought together by the power of the Holy Spirit in the preaching of the gospel. The gospel breaks down the dividing walls of color against color, of ethnicity versus ethnicity. Paul teaches the Ephesian church that in Christ, Jew and Gentile are one. How much more is that true all these years later of us? In a room like this, which hallelujah, is diverse. One, one in Christ. But now in Christ Jesus, you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ, for he himself is our peace, who has made us both one and has broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility by abolishing the law of commandments expressed in ordinances that he might create in himself, listen to this, one new man in place of the two. So making peace. Glory hallelujah, I know we're Presbyterians, but glory hallelujah. And might reconcile us both to God in one body, his body through the cross, thereby killing the hostility. The church, the church exists to show the world what kingdom of Christ living can look like. Imperfectly, yes, on this side of eternity. We are Christ's model to an unbelieving, warring, tribalistic world, what real family, real unity, real community should and can look like when Christ is worshiped as Lord and savior. The church of Jesus Christ exists to make disciples and to be the light of the world, which means that Christ's kingdom reality will speak into an impact to whatever degree God allows, families, neighborhoods, friendships, work, ethics, laws, every color of humanity. And the list goes on. The kingdom of Christ advances through who? You, God's renewed image bearers who are kingdom disciples. That is your confession by and large for most of you. Is that not true? When we come and we stand down here and we give our vows to the church of the Lord Jesus Christ, you disciples are first called to Christ and subsequently to all other areas of life by intentionally living according to Christ's lordship and sovereignty as defined and explained in his word. The scriptures. Disciples are called to live in such a way that the world sees how things are supposed to be. Amen. Amen. How the church of Jesus Christ treats people of all colors is extremely important. How else will people who do not know Christ know what true community, what real fellowship is if we don't model it before the watching world? Since college, I've been, my college discipleship group of which, and I'm gonna use color, there are two black guys and three white guys. We have met consistently once a year for 26 years. Oftentimes when we go out and we talk, we eat, people will say things like this. Are you all, are you a sports team traveling with each other? Which is a fine question, but do you get why they're asking the question? Why in the world are all you different colors of people together? We are asleep. This is the danger, y'all. We are asleep. And Jesus has called his church out of spiritual darkness. Amen. To be the light of the world. I could talk about all kinds of stuff in this sermon, but I can't because we're called to be the kingdom. Amen. Parents who confess Christ as Lord, it is important that you teach your children that God created all people, that God created all colors, and it must be respected. Amen. The kingdom of Christ is to make inroads into every sphere of influence in this world until Christ returns to consummate all of time in eternity, in history, excuse me. God is active in his creation. God is orchestrating the purification of his universe through the salvation of mankind and the redemption and restoration of the earth. The kingdom of God is growing, and this is to be evidenced and pursued intentionally by us, his disciples. Every day we live. The spirit of God living inside of God's disciples uses us to reflect the reality of God and the work and the reality of Jesus in all areas of our lives, regardless of our skin color. King Jesus wants you, you, to be the light of the world, to shine before other people, all people. Jesus came to build his church, a people for himself from every tribe and language and people and nation, and there's one more chapter. Chapter four, banquet. Chapter four, banquet. Renewal and glory awaits. Renewal and glory awaits. The last chapter is one of the greatest, if not the greatest. There's a great banquet in the future for all who have trusted Jesus Christ to be the only Savior and Lord. The banquet will be the time of the grand renewal and glory of all things, which means this. No more racism. No more oppression. No more one ethnic group seeking or claiming superiority or dominance over others. No more human disdain of a person's color, heritage, or culture. No more death. No more cancer. No more disease. No more war. No more breaking laws. No more fear. No more poverty. No more classism. No more men thinking they are superior to women or women believing they are superior to men. No more loneliness. No more sin. No more sin. Community and unity will be perfected forever, and it will never end. Hallelujah. Revelation five, verse nine and 10, they sang a new song saying, worthy are you, Jesus. It's who they're talking to, to take the scroll and to open its seals, for you were slain. And by your blood, you ransomed people for God from every tribe and language and people and nation. And you've made them a kingdom and priests to our God, and they shall reign on the earth. Revelation 19, verse six to nine, then I heard what seemed to be the voice of a great multitude, like the roar of many waters and like the sound of mighty peals of thunder crying out, hallelujah. For the Lord our God, the almighty reigns. Let us rejoice and exult and give him the glory for the marriage of the lamb has come and his bride has made herself ready. That's us. It was granted her to clothe herself with fine linen, bright and pure. The fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints. And the angel said to me, write this. Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the lamb. And he said to me, these are the true words of God. McLean Presbyterian Church, go and live this week as disciples and ambassadors of King Jesus and the kingdom of heaven. The Holy Spirit, he's with us to show the watching world how to really celebrate and live out human diversity. We can change the story, amen. Amen, amen. Let's pray together. Father, please transform us, my children. More and more and more into the image of Christ. Please conform our minds and hearts more and more through the power of your word and Holy Spirit so that we will love Jesus and live as he teaches us to live in this world. Teach us to love one another and not to hate or denigrate based on our skin color. Thank you for making us. Thank you for your mercy to us. We pray this in Jesus' name, amen.
