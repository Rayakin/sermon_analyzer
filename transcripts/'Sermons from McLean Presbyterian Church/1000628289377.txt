Well, good morning. Let me add my welcome. My name is Bill. I serve as one of the pastors here, particularly as the executive pastor in the broader Capital Press family. I'd like to say welcome to our church. Welcome to those of you in Reston. And would you please pray with me? God, our Father, we now come to words that we believe are not simply Paul's words, but are Paul's words that you inspired. And so we trust that there is not a stone for us here, but bread, that there is in fact life for us here. And so we pray you would help us to understand these words in our minds, but not just in our minds, to understand them in our hearts and to let them transform our lives and who we are. We pray that you would, and we pray it in Jesus' name. And all God's people said, amen. So Dana Chariton, who I do not know, a psychologist in Boulder, wrote this a few years back on a blog. She wrote, I can't tell you how many times a new client has walked into my office and told me, I don't understand why I'm so lonely. I bend over backwards to make everyone else happy. Why is it that no one seems to care how I feel? She goes further, she writes, it's a common phenomenon in which in order to feel safe and secure in our relationships, we can easily stop focusing on our own needs and wishes and put all of our energy into accommodating everybody else's. The problem, most of the time the strategy backfires on us. Well, let me just ask it directly then, who are you trying to make happy? Who are you trying to please? When it comes down to it empirically, she's almost certainly right. In a people-obsessed, influence-obsessed, power-obsessed culture, inevitably we're trying to keep a lot of other people happy. It works out in romantic relationships, it works out at work, it works out at home, it works out at school, and it works out at church. Who are you trying to keep happy? And if you say, man, that is not me, I march to my own drummer, thank you, well, maybe. But even if you do, you realize you've just swapped it out. Okay, I'm not trying to make all of them happy, I'm just picking a different person to try to make happy, I'm trying to make myself happy. It's still the same thing, you just changed who it is. And this is an exhausting and confining treadmill. If you're trying to keep everybody in all these areas of life happy, and I simply ask you, how do you feel? I think you're gonna say, tired. Tired and worn out, and maybe sick of it, because truth is, that people-pleasing treadmill is a nonstop, unconquerable thing that will break us all in the end. And if the people-pleasing treadmill is not them but me, it may look less transactional, but in the end of the day, it's still the same thing, you're still looking for one more thing, and then another thing the next day to keep yourself happy. In Galatians 1, the second half of this chapter, verses 10 to 24, comes into that, and what it says to us is that there is actually freedom from people-pleasing if we encounter the true gospel of Jesus Christ. There is freedom from people-pleasing if we encounter the true gospel of Jesus Christ. Now, last week, JT at Reston, Rob at Fairfax, Ryan here, as we first stepped into this book, this thing that's really a letter called Galatians, pointed out that what's going on is Galatians is Paul's defense of the true gospel of Jesus Christ against distortions of it. And the people who are leading to those distortions, often people call them the Judaizers, have realized that if they want to defeat Paul's message, the best thing they can do is defeat Paul. And so Paul has, in a sense, been put on trial, not in a physical sense, but in the court of public opinion in the Galatian church. And what we have here this morning is Paul's defense. And so what we're going to look at are really three things. We're gonna look at the charge, we're gonna look at Paul's defense, and then we're gonna think about the impact of that together. So the charge, Paul's defense, the impact of it. Ready? The charge is verse 10. So look down in your Bible. Now, actually, back up for a second, look at verse seven. Remember the backstory here. Paul had started this church or these churches in Galatia, had pastored them for a while, had moved on to start new churches elsewhere, and then a new group of influencers has moved in. And this new group of influencers is basically saying, Paul didn't really get it right. In fact, what they're saying is, Paul is bad news. So running behind our whole passage today is just this question, who is this guy to get to say these things to us? And verse 10 sharpens for us what was going on. Look at what Paul says. He says, am I now trying to please people or trying to please God? So that tells you in a backhanded way what the charge was. Here was the charge. Paul is just like a political pastor. He's just telling people what they want to hear so he can get their votes. He's actually watering it down. He's making it nice and easy. He doesn't really care about obedience because he just wants you to like him. Paul is the ultimate seeker-sensitive, people-pleasing pastor. That's the charge. Why would they make this charge? What's going on behind this? Because if all we do is look at these Judaizers and think those are people who don't know how to have fun and wanna make sure nobody else knows how to have fun, we'll really miss what this passage has for us. What's going on? Why are they making this charge? Well, keep in mind this fact. The Galatians, these new Christians, are ethnically Gentile. They're from all the other nations. These Judaizers are ethnically Jewish. And they step in and they understand and are really happy that all these Gentiles are becoming Christians. Now, if you look at chapter two, which we'll get to in the following weeks, there may still be some latent racism. There is still seemingly some amount of sort of a racial superiority, but that's not working its way out with, oh, I wish these people wouldn't be here. They are thrilled to see even all these Gentiles start to follow Jesus. They just say, man, don't you realize what that needs to work out? That needs to work out by actually becoming Jewish. Here's how the logic works. Here's what they're thinking. They're thinking, look, Jesus is the king of the Jews. And it is a great thing that all these Gentiles have willingly bowed the knee and followed the Jewish king. His name is Jesus Christ. Therefore, these folks need to do what you always do when you join into following the Jewish king. It's been happening for thousands of years in the Old Testament, which is you take that mark of following him upon yourself, the mark of being part of God's people. It's called circumcision. You label yourself as a follower of Jesus. And the way you do it is you get circumcised. To these Judaizers, this is simply the logical and inevitable and required outcome of having faith in Jesus. Except it wasn't. God didn't think so. Paul says again and again, loudly and repeatedly in this letter and elsewhere, no. In fact, he says, if you do that, what you're actually doing is you are binding yourself into a way of relating to God that though you may think it's just an expression of this finding of Jesus that you've got, it's actually not. It binds you to something that's entirely different and puts you back on a treadmill of trying to please God in ways that they're not even the gospel at all. It's not just another gospel. It's not good news at all. It's terrible news. So keep in mind what Paul just did, what he's saying. He's saying, yeah, you're accusing me of being the people pleaser. He goes, actually, it's quite the reverse. The true gospel of Jesus is the one that's making you all mad. It's the one that you're feeling like you have to oppose. He says, who's the people pleaser here? It's you guys, the Judaizers, the opposite, who are trying to follow these traditions of thousands of years and say, we've got to do what people always say you should do. It's like one of those movies where you're watching it and at the very last minute, everything switches and everything he thought was up was down and down was up. He says, I'm not the one who's people pleasing here. He says, I know what that's like, but God busted in to reverse it. And that leads us to the main part of this passage, verses 11 all the way to 24, the end, which is Paul's defense. To show that Paul did not make this up, to show that Paul is not simply saying what people want to hear, Paul launches into this long defense that kind of has two parts. Part one is verses 11 to 17. And in that part, Paul talks about his own reversal, how Jesus stepped in and changed it all for him. And in verses 18 to 24, he goes into who he talked to. So let's look at this reversal. Look at verses 11 to 17. The key thing Paul is after here is he said, I didn't make this up and nobody else told it to me. He said, this message I have brought has been given to me directly by Jesus Christ, the risen Lord. The whole emphasis he's making is it's not a human invention, it's God's invention. Now, how does he defend that? He says, well, hey, hold on a second. I am no self-appointed ambassador for the gospel. He said, when I was self-appointed, I actually was a persecutor of the gospel. He said, when I was the self-appointed guy, I was the prosecutor. I know what it means to please people. Verse 10, you notice he says, am I still pleasing people? He has known what this is like. He in verses 13 and 14, he details it. He says, man, growing up, I knew how to keep the adults and the elders as happy as they could be. He said, I advanced far beyond anybody else in my age. My parents on the back of their ox cart, they had a my kid is an honor student at Gamaliel's Jewish day school sticker, and I was the best baby. He says, I was killing it in Judaism. And then as he got more towards adulthood, he knew exactly what it meant to be zealous. He says, you wanna try the zealous for Judaism thing? I understand, because I did it. And you know how it worked out? It worked out by trying to destroy Christianity. He says, everybody knows what I was like. If you want the big version, go read Acts chapter eight and nine. Paul says, I was actually going and killing the Christians. Chapter eight of Acts, it says he was going house to house and throwing them in jail. Chapter seven of Acts says he was willing to help stoke mob violence, leading to murder. Paul says, you want what I am as a self-appointed person? It's not what I've been preaching to you. I was as against it as I could possibly be until Jesus Christ broke in and flipped me upside down. Verses 15 to 17 talk about what happened in Acts chapter nine. Paul's name had been Saul back then, and Jesus broke in and literally knocked him off his feet, physically blinded him to show him what had always been spiritually true, that in his pursuit of pleasing people, he'd actually not been seeing God. And so Paul had Jesus himself step in and say, no, this is my truth. This is my gospel. This is my good news. This is my message. Go tell people. And Paul says, I didn't make this up because nobody would make this up. I mean, look, if we were gonna make up a religion, we might make up what you'd call libertinism, that in fact, I can do whatever I want because I'm my own person and I get to determine what's good for me. If your version of people-pleasing is self-pleasing, that's exactly what we'd make up. But this gospel isn't libertinism, it's sin and redemption. Or we might go the other way. We might make up legalism, not saying you guys are the legalists, but we might make up legalism. You know what? I'm gonna come up with a big set of rules and I'm gonna follow all the rules so they make people happy and they might even make God happy with me. If your version is please other people, well, yeah, we might make that up. But again, the gospel's neither of those. It's sin and redemption. The authentic gospel of Jesus Christ that Paul is preaching steps in and says, my goodness, you are so much worse than you ever thought you were. The problems with us run so much deeper. Everything about us is stained by sin. We don't want the right things. We don't do the right things. We need to be saved. And the true gospel of Jesus Christ steps in and says, and yes, Jesus did it for you. You didn't earn it. You didn't do something any more than Paul did something. Jesus showed up and knocked him off his feet with the truth of the gospel. You see, if we invent a version of our faith, we're gonna end up muting one of those two. Either we're gonna decrease what sin matters. We're gonna say, oh, sin's not really that big of a deal. Or we're gonna decrease what redemption matters. We're gonna say, well, I'm gonna do some stuff to bring that forth. Paul says, nobody would have invented this. Why not? Well, because the gospel requires an exceptional humility and an exceptional trust. When a 21st century person, just like a first century person, comes to the true gospel of Jesus Christ, it requires an incredible humility. I have to step in and say, I am broken. I am stained. I am not able to be what I ought to be. Not even just what I do, but what I think, what I want. I am a fundamental hot mess that needs to be rescued. The gospel requires an incredible humility in us. And it requires an incredible trust. A statement that, you know what? At the end of the day, I don't even know what's best for me. At the end of the day, someone else knows better than I do what would really be good for me. At the end of the day, even if I could determine my own way, I shouldn't. But I know him who can, and I trust him. The gospel requires an incredible humility and an incredible trust, but please recognize it gives an incredible freedom. When we step in and embrace Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior, what the gospel does is it frees us entirely to only try to please the one person who's worth it and who deserves it, which is God himself. So Paul says, I didn't make this up. I wouldn't have made this up. If I was making something up, it would be the old me, not the new me. And then that leads to the second piece of his defense. Look at verses 18 to the end of the chapter. Paul says, look, I've been very clear. I didn't make this thing up. Jesus gave it to me. But you notice he does in the end go talk to some other people. Why and how? Why does that work out? Well, Paul has just had a lot of stuff dropped on him. He pretty much pieces out for three years. He's got a lot to figure out. But when he comes back, before he really starts his ministry, he says, I went up and talked to Peter and to James. Why, what's going on? Well, it's certainly not that he got this gospel from Peter and James. He just made it very clear that's not what happened. Here's what had happened though. Paul had this experience and this experience absolutely convinced him. That at the end of the day, everything he had been preaching before was wrong. I mean, what he said last week, don't let the translations water it down. He says, if anybody preaches any other gospel than this, let him be accursed. What that means is let him be in hell forever. Paul was that convinced of the truth of this gospel he was preaching. But you all realize, right? Experiences can always be read two ways. Like kids, if you decide to go out for basketball, second graders, if you start basketball this year and you decide that you're gonna go for basketball and then you get your team assignment and you're placed on a team with none of your friends. Well, I suppose you could read that as like, wow, God's telling me not to play basketball after all because I'm not with my friends. You know, you could also read that as God's telling me to make some new friends. Now, seniors, you're applying to colleges. Say you apply to a bunch of colleges and you get into exactly zero. Well, you could read that as God's telling me not to go to college next year. You could also read that as maybe God's telling me to go to a different place, none of the ones I thought about. Adults, you could be trying to switch careers, get a new job, you find the job you think's gonna be perfect for you, you apply for it, you get an interview, and they say no. Well, you could read that as God saying I'm supposed to stay in my current career. You could also read that as no, I'm supposed to switch careers, just not to that job. The point is events can always get more than one interpretation. And that's why it's always been sound biblical doctrine and advice that events need to be interpreted through God's word. This is why it's so important when Paul gets knocked off his feet that Jesus also talks to him. Jesus tells him how to interpret what's just happened. But don't you recognize that the Judaizers are also pretty convinced that God has told them exactly how to interpret things? They say we've got thousands of years of Bible that say you're supposed to be circumcised. Paul says absolutely not, Jesus told me that's not it. One or the other of them has to be right and one or the other of them has to be wrong. And y'all, I have talked to a lot of people on the streets of both New York and DC who are very convinced God told them something and I'm pretty sure he didn't, right? So how do we know Paul's not bluffing? How do we know Paul's not just making this thing up or maybe fooling himself? Well, that's where it matters that Paul went and talked to James and Peter. The authority of Paul's revelation is not from them. He's made that very clear. But he does go talk to them and say, hey, this is what I understand Jesus told me. Does it match what Jesus told you? And look at what verse 24 says. Everybody says yes. They don't ask him to change a thing. They simply celebrate what has happened. So Paul offers this defense. He says, I didn't make this thing up and I'm not a lone ranger here out on my own. This is God's message to us. Well, if so, third question, what's the impact of all that? What's that mean? And how do we take that and see what it means to us? Well, first think about Paul. What Jesus just has done in his life has severed Paul from everything he ever knew religiously and culturally and socially. When this happens to Paul, he suddenly finds out that everything that had ever been piety, everything he was ever doing to try to chase God, it turns out was evil. In the blink of an eye, Paul has to realize that all the things he was doing that he thought were his service to God were actually him being an enemy of God. He has to realize that for his whole life, he's lived as God's enemy and he realizes it just like that. But it's not even just that. Think what would have happened to Paul's social life, to his economic life, to his religious life, all his compatriots, all his coworkers, all the people he kind of hung out with would immediately be like, you're out. Paul was gonna be leaving behind everything. Do you realize what that means for you and me? I don't care how long your rap sheet is and whether it's with the police or whether it's just with God, he's calling to you this morning saying, come to the true gospel of Jesus Christ. And I don't care how high you have gone in another faith, you couldn't get much higher than Paul was getting. And Jesus is calling you and saying, no, come to me this morning. Come to the true gospel, which is sin forgiven by the blood of Jesus. You know, if you count the cost that Paul faced, it was a huge cost. And I won't make any false promises here. The cost that we face coming to Christ can be a huge cost. But Paul was willing to pay it, he was happy to pay it. Why? Because he'd found something better. Better put, because something better had found him. Because what Paul had seen was Jesus who had done this even further, even more thoroughly than Paul ever could dream of. When our Lord walked the earth, he was regularly encountering the temptation to please people. One of the devil's key temptations was, do this so they will all worship you. They'll be happy with you. Jesus said, no, my will is to do the will of the one who sent me. As he walked the earth and taught, person after person from the religious leadership said, it is so great that you're teaching this. The way it works out is you treat the Sabbath this way. And Jesus said, no. In fact, if he would have just knuckled under and done what the religious leaders wanted behaviorally, he wouldn't have been crucified. But he wasn't ready to please those people because he needed to please the Father. Even more, the night before he was betrayed in the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus' sweating blood, knowing what's coming, has every temptation to just please himself. What does he say? He says, Father, I don't want this. And yet at the end, what does he say? Not my will be done. I'm not gonna try to please myself, but your will be done. This Jesus dies on a cross precisely because he was determined to please God the Father and not people, not even himself in his human nature. And three days later, that's the Jesus who rose and called out to Paul on the road to Damascus and changed everything. You all, brothers, sisters, there is freedom in Christ. And if you have not met this Jesus Paul met, come and meet him this morning. If you don't know how, find Terrence, find me, find somebody else, anybody wearing a name tag after the service and ask how. Now, if you have already, if that's been your confession, maybe since the time you were a young pup, you don't even remember a time you didn't believe this, what does the text mean to you and to me? Let me suggest two things. Number one, this is the freedom from just trying to please people. This gospel is the way off that treadmill because what the Bible gives us, what Jesus Christ gives us is the ability to take our gaze off them and off ourselves and put it onto Jesus. And I don't have to make them happy anymore because I've got a different audience. And you may be saying, well, that sounds real good, but you know what? I've been a Christian for a long time and I'm still doing the people-pleasing thing just as bad as I ever did, probably worse. Well, yeah, of course you are. You live here and you're a person. But the answer to that is not to find something new, something different, something bigger. The answer to that is to take the same gospel of Jesus Christ and apply it more thoroughly into our lives. It's that every time I think, oh, what's she gonna think? I go, no, wrong question. What's the Lord gonna think? Every time I say, what do I want here? It's actually, wait, wait, wrong question. What does God want with this? What the gospel does if we push it deeper in is it lets us reorient all of our relationships into actually the healthy, right place. So first, the gospel gives us freedom, freedom from people-pleasing. Second, it demands that we give everybody else freedom. I mean, have you ever thought about this? We find freedom in the gospel and then when we step into other people's lives, we start actually trying to limit their freedom. Do you catch the problem with that? I mean, recognize what the Galatians were dealing with. The Judaizers were thrilled these people were finding Jesus. They said, that is so great and here's the inevitable way you apply that. You apply it by changing out your culture entirely and adopting mine. And now we start to see how tempted we are to do the same thing. It is so easy to be thrilled that that person has come to Jesus and say, great, now you need to start looking a lot like me. Now, make no mistake, there are certain behaviors that are expected of Christians. Christians do believe certain things and not other things. Christians do act certain ways and not other ways. Verse 13 even kind of mentions it. It says the former way of life, which implies there is a change. And in fact, in Galatians 5 and 6, near the end of this letter, Paul is gonna talk about things that he says, look, this is expected Christian behavior. The problem is we start trying to bind people not to those things, but to the things that are our own, that are just our preferences, that are just our way of doing it, that are just our culture. We find people becoming Christians and we try to make them look like us. God brings people to be Christians and he wants to make them look like Jesus. What do we start doing? Well, what we start doing is we start finding all these other things that are really not the things God would ask of them and we say, oh, well, in my life, that's been the way that this has worked out, so you need to just start to resemble me a little bit more. It's so easy to be a Judaizer without even knowing it. Great, you've become a Christian. You need to start dressing like me. You need to start dressing this way. I mean, great, you've become a Christian. Time to start listening to this type of music and not that one, to read these books, not this one, to follow that blog, not this one. Nevermind that that might actually not be what Jesus has for the person, but it's just what I prefer. Remember that the Judaizers thought this was simply about following Jesus consistently and yet Paul says it wasn't. So we say, great, you've become a Christian. You need to care about the same issues I do with the exact same percentage of passion I do. You need to give to the same charities I do. You need to follow the same teachers and same authors. You need to vote the same way I do. We take all these other things that we in human, remember the Judaizers were blind to this and we very blindly and easily take things that are actually Christ worked out by this and start to make them a requirement. And what Galatians tells us, it says, here we've got to be incredibly careful to parse this out incredibly gently and charitably and cautiously. Lest we actually start putting demands on people that we are convinced are just the way the gospel always works out in life. But God would say, actually, it's no gospel at all. God protect us and help us to be careful in that. Let's pray. God, our father, we pray you would do what this passage challenges. Which is help us to see when we're pursuing Jesus and when we are actually pursuing other things. So we confess we can be blind. In fact, we confess we are blind. And what we ask is you pull the blindness off our eyes just like you pulled it off of Paul's. Such that we would see Jesus and our lives would be changed and they would be different because we all together and each on our own would be made more into his image. We want to look like him, father. So we pray it in Jesus' name, amen.
