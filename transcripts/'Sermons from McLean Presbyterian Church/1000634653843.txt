Good morning. My name's Ryan. It's good to be with you this morning as we're looking at Galatians. Welcome to our friends at our rest and site who are tuning in to the sermon this morning. It's good to be with you all in person and virtually as well. There's a lot in this passage to talk about. It reminds me of conversations I feel like I have with friends and family often about projects that they do on their own. If you ever had this conversation with somebody, you see like a new floor in their basement, you're like, that's really impressive. Who did that? They're like, well, I did that. Oh, how'd you learn how to do that? I watched some YouTube videos on how to do that. Yeah, it looks like you use YouTube for that. Or, you know, or someone changes out the engine in their car. They're like, how did you do that? I just, I kind of figured it out. Really? That's, that's very, where'd you learn how to ride a unicycle? Well, I, you know, I just, I got a book, I read a book. I'm just surprised and always slightly amazed. And I will say impressed by do-it-yourself projects. Like those are always very impressive to me. And then you come across a passage like this and you realize that I think a lot of us entered into this room, maybe not thinking about everything that's in this passage, all the bad stuff that clearly we're supposed to avoid and all the good stuff that we're supposed to be working toward. And we just kind of have this assumption that the Christian life is like this just giant do-it-yourself project. Like, how is it that you avoid this long list of ugliness that's in this passage and immorality and the kinds of things that do damage to ourselves and our others? I don't know. You just watch some YouTube videos and figure it out. How is it that you get love, joy, peace, patience deep into your life? I don't know. You just buy some Christian books and listen to some worship music and just, you know, hope it all kind of works out. And we forget that when Jesus was about to go to the cross, he has this conversation with his disciples and it's about this very thing. He's preparing them for life without him in the flesh. And he says to them specifically, when I go, I'm not really leaving you. In fact, I'm going to continue to be with you in an even more powerful, personal way. He says, I'm not going to abandon you and leave you as orphans. I'm going to send another helper, a comforter, my very presence, the Holy Spirit, who will be with you and within you. And that's what Paul is picking up on in this passage. If he has given any of us the impression in the book of Galatians that Christianity is a do-it-yourself project, like Jesus saves us, rescues us, and then sets us free to kind of like just figure out how to do all this, we've got it all wrong. Paul says that the greatest resource that God has given us for holiness and obedience is himself. Paul says elsewhere that, don't you know, Christian, that you are a temple of God for the Holy Spirit lives within you. And in this passage, Paul then begins to work out for us, well, what does that mean for like Thursday afternoon? Like what does that really mean for us to work with the Holy Spirit as he is working in us? Well, that's what we're going to talk about this morning. I'm going to pray for us as we begin. Father, we do pray that you would send a refreshing sense of your Holy Spirit, that Holy Spirit, you might be at work within us as we listen to these words, as we seek even now to keep in step with you where you are leading us. We need you and we ask that you would do this for the glory of Jesus in our lives. Amen. Paul gives us two ways of thinking about how it is that we work with the Holy Spirit who is at work within us. First of all, fight your sin, fight your sin. And then secondly, follow the spirit, fight your sin, follow the spirit. Paul makes very clear in this passage that if you are a Christian, by definition, you are in a fight. That is normal. Okay. So some of us came in this morning, for those of us who are Christians, and we just feel beat up, honestly. We're exhausted and we feel like if there is a fight, we've been losing that fight. And we begin to question when we come into a place like this and sing songs like that, read passages like this, we begin to question, you know, if I feel embattled all the time, there must be something wrong with me. Like that must not be normal in the Christian experience. Surely there are super saints out there, like uber Christians out there who never struggle with anything. And you would be absolutely 100% wrong about that. Because the moment the Holy Spirit enters your life, the fight starts. That's what Paul says, not just here, but other places as well. But here he puts it this way in verse 17, for the desires of the flesh are against the spirit and the desires of the spirit are against the flesh for these are opposed to each other. So as a Christian, there is a tug of war going on inside of you. The desires of the flesh, the desires of the spirit, they are opposed to one another. They want different things for you. And so Paul says, we must fight your sin. In order to do that, we need to start at the root of sin, which Paul describes as the desires of the flesh. Now, unfortunately, Christians throughout history and even in our present day often define the desires of flesh as like bodily desires. So that what gets villainized in this conversation is our bodies, are our bodies and the desires that go along with that, whether it's the desire for food or for drink or sexual desire or desire for comfort or physical presence of others and all the rest. We begin to think, well, that's the bad stuff. I just need to stop desiring those things. But actually, the Bible says God made us as creatures with desires, and those desires are good when they are expressed in the ways that God has given us to express those things. What Paul's talking about here is literally the word overdesire. So the word that's translated desire in verse 17 is translated overdesire. That's what the word literally means. And what he's getting at is what we also read about in the book of James, that there are desires in our lives that very quickly go from desire to demand. So now it's not just that we want something, we have to have it. And that's not always bad things. For example, some of us very rightly in our families would love to have a family that gets along together and that enjoys meals together and plays games together and talks nicely to each other. That's a good thing. Family harmony is a good thing. But just speaking as a parent, not all of us are parents, but if you're a parent, you know that if you desire something like that and it becomes a demand, like we are going to have a happy family, like right now, it's going to be good. A good desire becomes a demand. And all of a sudden, ironically enough, you're the one who's disrupting all the harmony. Financial security, it's a good thing to want to be financially secure, to work for a living, to care for the people in your life, to care for yourself. But when financial security becomes a demand, like I have to know that I have enough. Well, you know where that leads. Not to good places. What Paul's talking about here is the battle within us and especially the battle with battle with those desires and passions that just kind of overtake your life. I mean, some of us know this in romantic relationships. You know, some of us might be in a relationship or have been in a relationship with somebody and it's like, I don't just want it. I need it. I have to have it. Even though you know and everyone in your life is like, that relationship is terrible for you. It's like, I know, but I just, I have to have that sense that someone wants me and needs me. That's what Paul is describing here. This is the pathway that Paul says leads to the works of the flesh. Notice in verse 19, Paul moves this fight from the root, which is the desire to the surface. And he says in verse 19, now the works of the flesh are evident. The word there means obvious. It's like Paul's like, I shouldn't even have to tell you what they are. They're that obvious. They're that evident. But then what does Paul do? He tells us what they are. And by the way, it's not an exhaustive list because he says at the end, and there are other things like this, but he gives us a sample. Why would he do that? They're obvious. Why does he need to tell us? Well, because Paul knows the human heart. He knows that in, um, in the everyday course of life, when these sorts of things pop up in our lives, and all of us can probably look at this list and recognize some things that went on this week that perhaps we're ashamed of or not happy with. He knows that our tendency immediately because of the sinfulness of our hearts is to rationalize, to explain it away, to do the whatabouts. Yeah, but what about this person? They're, they're really much more envious than I am. Or what about so-and-so? I know what she did on Friday night, right? We rationalize, we justify, we diminish. And Paul's like, well, no, that's actually not the way forward when it comes to growing in relationship with Christ. The way forward is to see our sin, even at the surface, in all of its ugliness and all of the ways that it harms us and harms other people. And to be honest, that God's grace doesn't lead us toward hiding our sin. God's grace actually invites us to be honest, to do something about it. By the way, when he says in verse 21 against such things, I'm sorry, when he says in verse 21, those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God, the word there, the verb translated there, who do such things. Notice it doesn't say who have done such things because then we'd all be in trouble because we've all done things on this list, if not all of them, most of them. What he's talking about is the habitual, regular, as a way of life. In other words, someone who says, yeah, this is what I want in life and I'm going to pursue it and I'm not planning on stopping anytime soon. Paul is giving a clear warning that if your life is marked by these things, then God will hold us accountable. Like God doesn't trifle with these things. God isn't to be played with, that we are morally accountable and that these things have no place in the kingdom of God. And at the same time, even those of us who see this and say, well, I don't want my life to be marked with these things. Even if we struggle with some of them, Paul is still giving us a very clear warning that we need to take our sin seriously, that the invitation of grace is not the invitation to minimize our sin. It's actually just the opposite, is to take it deeply seriously because of what God has done for us in Christ. We want to respond to him in every area of our lives with joyful obedience. The other day, I got a text at work from my wife, who's not here today, but I did get permission to, she'll be here at the second service, so you can ask her between services, but I did get her permission to share this with you. So the text was, so your dad just killed a rattlesnake in their bathroom. They live in Arizona, so this is why this makes sense. Your dad just killed a rattlesnake in their bathroom, and then there was a rattlesnake emoji at the end, which that's how I knew it was from my wife. There was an emoji included. I didn't know there was a rattlesnake emoji, but there it was. And then I will just read you the responses. This went to our family text, so that's my wife and me and our three boys. And so their response, the following, the first response, beast, all right? That is referring to my dad, not the snake, beast. The second, goat, that's not misnaming. That's actually, again, my dad, the goat, not the snake. And the last one, snake killer. Okay, those are the three responses. You know, we're met a few words. I mean, what more needs to be said except beast, ghost, and snake killer? Now, it turns out it wasn't that big of a snake, all right? It turns out it might not even have been a rattlesnake, but that doesn't matter. I didn't want to have to tell you that. I just like full disclosure. I'm feeling convicted to give you full disclosure. And yet, no one on that text group said, oh man, poor snake, right? Or, oh, why didn't you leave that for mom to discover? Because that would have been awesome, right? Like nobody thought, let's go for less invasive measures. Like a rattlesnake in the bathroom needs to go. Now, some of you would say, well, we shouldn't kill it. We should get it and put it outside. That's fine if that's how you want to handle it. But all of us would agree rattlesnake can't just stay in the bathroom for an early morning wake up session, right? Like it's got to go. And what Paul is saying is when you see the ugliness and the destructive power of sin in your life at the root and at the surface, you don't just let it stay there. You know, we don't cuddle the rattlesnake. We remove it because we know how dangerous it is. The Puritan John Owen famously said, be killing sin or it will be killing you. And this is the posture that Paul is giving us here, not to shame us, but to lead us into a place of deeper repentance. I want to see how this works. So earlier in chapter four, Paul reminded us that part of the ministry of the Holy Spirit, the third person of the Trinity in our lives, part of what he does for us is he cries out in our hearts, Abba, Father. He reminds us that through Jesus, we have really been adopted into God's family so that we can trust that God, our Father, delights in us. Even at our worst, he welcomes us into his presence through the finished work of Jesus. And it is that cry of Abba, Father, that is really the first and last word of repentance. That's what really what we're talking about. It's, it's turning away from our sin, grieving it and turning back to Jesus. And it is those words, Abba, Father, it's like the first and last word of repentance. It's the one, those are the words that welcome us in, knowing that God delights in us. But those are also the words that turn us away from those things that are tearing us up and turning us back so that we might live in joyful obedience, knowing that he is our Father. Fighting your sin, yes, it's a battle. But it also is the pathway to deeper joy in Christ. Secondly, Paul says we need to follow the spirit. Four times in these verses, Paul uses some version of the phrase, follow the spirit or be, be led by the spirit. Verse 16, walk by the spirit. Verse 18, you are led by the spirit. Verse 25, live by the spirit. Followed by this phrase, let us also keep in step with the spirit. Notice, these are commands, they're not suggestions, they're not just things that happen when you let go and let God. These are expressed activities of the Christian to keep in step with the spirit. Happy Veterans Day, by the way, to all the veterans. If you're a veteran, then you know what it means to keep in step with the rhythm of the band. I just speak as one who spent his college years, many, many hours of my college years on a parade field somewhere. All right, and I had to learn when I first got there with my bald head at 17, never marched a day in my life. First thing I had to learn, I had to learn to listen. Right, I had to learn to listen to the done, done, done. And then when I was not keeping in step, I had, you know, about 100 friends around me who would yell at me, keep in step. And what do they mean? Listen, and then yield, right? It's not enough to listen, like, oh, I hear it. You have to yield. Now you have to give yourself over to the rhythm that someone else is setting for you. There's a reason we say about people who do whatever they want, you know, he kind of marches to the beat of his own drummer, right? That's someone who sets his own cadence or sets her own cadence and just like marches along. Or, you know, she's kind of on her own wavelength. You know, she's tuned into a different frequency. What we mean is they just kind of are all over the place. And what Paul is saying is that Christian life is not marching to the beat of your own drum. It's hearing the cadence of the gospel and walking in line with it, keeping in step with it. So how do you do that? How do you listen to the Spirit? You can't see him. You can't touch him. You don't wake up in the morning and there are little footprints that you just kind of follow along. Most of us don't hear an audible voice on a regular basis. How do you listen to the Spirit? I mean, Paul is clearly saying we should have some sort of tuned in frequency when it comes to the Holy Spirit. Well, sometimes you hear Christians say things like, well, the Spirit just kind of prompted me to do that. Or the Spirit led me to do that, which I totally understand. I've experienced the same thing. That sort of internal nudge that you have to sit down and talk to somebody that you probably weren't going to talk to or reach out to somebody that maybe, you know, in your own selfishness, you wouldn't necessarily do. You feel pushed internally, motivated to do something. And I understand and I've felt that experience myself. And yet, I would suggest to you that even those experiences are more the Spirit applying what he's already taught you. Let me explain what I mean by that. So, you know, if the Spirit prompts you to sit next to somebody at school who doesn't have anybody to sit next to in the cafeteria. Like, I wonder, is that just kind of completely out of the blue? Or could it be that the Spirit is actually applying the very Word of God, which says that we ought to consider others better than ourselves? Or when we're moved to give generously, is that just the Spirit kind of out of thin air, prompting us to do something? Or could it be the Holy Spirit is applying the Word, which he has already planted in our heart, which tells us that Christ Jesus, though he was rich, became poor, so that we might be generous with everything we have and everything we are. In other words, those moments of prompting, what's kind of going on in the operating system is the Holy Spirit is taking the Word of God and applying it in real time. And the reason I want to frame it that way is not to take out the mystery of the very presence of God working in and through us. It's to direct you to the very place where God says, I will speak to you in his Word. So, now the older theologians would say, the Spirit speaks to us through a diligent use of the means of grace. Okay, that does have a nice little rhythm to it. It feels a little archaic. Those are all really good words, diligent use, means of grace. As we come to worship, we're not just doing it to check a box. We really believe that when God says, I will meet with you as I gather my people under his Word and around the table, that he speaks to us. We can listen to him as we read and meditate and listen to and memorize and devour the Word of God. We are not just checking a box. We are listening to the living God as he speaks to us. In the very place he says, this is where I want to speak to you. And it is from that place of listening that we speak back in prayer. So, what does it mean to keep in step with the Spirit? Well, we have to begin by listening to the Spirit. How do we do that? Primarily, as we give ourselves over to the Word of God, the Word of the living God. And then secondly, we yield to it. So, it doesn't do any good to listen and then go, yeah, now. And if you think that yielding is a passive activity, then you have it all wrong. If you try to yield passively on the way home on 495, like if that's the moment you go, Jesus, take the wheel, like it's not going to go well for you. You know what you need to do. You know, you need to kind of make room. You know, you need to kind of maneuver yourself. But there is an active yielding. There is an opening of clenched hands that needs to take place as we yield ourselves to what the Spirit calls us to do. Now, this is a longer conversation because I think when many of us think about yielding to the Spirit's guidance and will, immediately where we go are all of those deep and profound and uncertain decisions that we're making right now in life. So, like, you know, the conversations I have with many of you, like, I'm at a point in life I need to figure out, like, who am I going to marry and where am I going to go to school and what am I going to do with the rest of my life and what am I going to do in retirement? And there's all these big questions that we're wrestling with like, Lord, show me what you want me to do. And I don't want to downplay or minimize how difficult, but also actually how wonderful those moments can be when the Lord meets us with his guidance and his wisdom and the Holy Spirit really does providentially move us through those times. That's been my experience. But I think sometimes we make this a little too complicated. Because even in those moments of uncertainty, like the wilderness of uncertainty about what am I supposed to do next? I'll just tell you, you always know what the Holy Spirit's will is for you at any given moment. Paul tells us in those moments, what are we supposed to do? We're supposed to choose love, joy, peace, patience. It's not that mysterious. It's not easy in those moments to ask, what does love require of me? It's not easy. What does patience require me? It's not easy, but here's the expressed will of God for your life that these fruit of the Spirit, as Paul calls them, will become increasingly a reality in your life. Notice in verse 22, the word is fruit, not fruits of the Spirit. Now, we don't want to make too much of that. There are many fruits, but I think the word fruit is important just for us to remember that what's on this list is a package deal. We talked about this a little bit last week. We don't get to pick and choose the ones we like. Like, hey, Ryan, why don't you just pick the three that are your top three? And the rest, if you just don't get around to that, that's fine. Okay, can I take self-control off the list? Anybody else? So it's not a multiple choice. It's the Holy Spirit cultivating Christ-like character in you. It's a package deal. It's love and self-control. It's goodness and faithfulness and so on. And also, these are the fruit of the Spirit. This is not just, again, a do-it-yourself project. This is the Holy Spirit working within you, and we're being called to yield, to give ourselves over in an active, as Francis Schaeffer would say, an active passivity, an opening of the hands to receive the work the Lord is doing. Now, if that's true, the question is, like, well, what's left to do? I mentioned this is Thursday afternoon theology, okay? This is when you're not feeling at your best or your strongest or your most awake, which actually might be the case right now. Well, yielding is not passive. It's not letting go of the rope in this tug-of-war. It's actually pulling in the same direction as the Spirit. It's asking questions like, what does patience require of me right now? What does patience require of you right now? And by the way, that's a question you don't just have to ask yourself. That's a question that's best asked in community. So let's just take patience, for instance. There are lots of things in life that test my patience. Driving on 495 tests my patience. The Washington commanders test my patience, like, all the time, right? Like, your barista may test your patience. But the real test of patience is how you treat the people in your life. Like, the stress test of the fruit of the Spirit is community. So I can get over my impatience with other things pretty quickly. But the people in my life know whether or not the Holy Spirit is really working patience into my life. So here's the thing. Don't just ask yourself, what does patience require of me? I would love for you to ask the people who know you best. Where do I need to grow in patience? And let me just say, buckle up for that conversation. But what's interesting is that when there are flare-ups in relationships, you get it sort of in short bursts. But when you honestly ask, I really want to know, and you get an honest answer, not always easy to hear. Which is why this question, too, really needs to be directed to God himself. Spirit, help me. The yielding is not just, let me try harder. The yielding is, Spirit, help me. And we ask that in the moment. When we feel our patience slipping away, when we feel our self-control slipping away, Spirit, help me. Listen to you and yield to you. C.S. Lewis, in his book, Mere Christianity, compares all this to a house project. Remember we talked about do-it-yourself house projects? I'm impressed with many of you for being able to do that. But I said to you, the Christian life is not a do-it-yourself house project. And C.S. Lewis makes this case in Mere Christianity when he says this. Imagine yourself as a living house, he writes. God comes in to rebuild this house. At first, perhaps, you can understand what he's doing. He's getting the drains right and stopping the leaks in the roof and so on. And you knew those jobs needed to be done, so you're not surprised. But presently, he starts knocking about the house in a way that hurts. And does not seem to make any sense. What on earth is he up to? The explanation is that he is building quite a different house from the one you thought of. Throwing out a new wing here, putting on an extra floor there, running up towers, making courtyards. You thought you were being made into a decent little cottage. But he is building a palace. Why? Because he intends to come and live in it himself. Let me pray for us. Father, we thank you that you have, in Jesus and through the presence of the Holy Spirit in our lives, committed to build us into something beautiful. Something so beautiful it is worthy of your presence. Holy Spirit, help us, as we often have grown weary in this fight, and honestly just kind of tired of ourselves, to not grow weary in doing good. That the love of Christ might be fuel for our obedience today and for the rest of our days. For we ask it in Jesus' name. Amen.
