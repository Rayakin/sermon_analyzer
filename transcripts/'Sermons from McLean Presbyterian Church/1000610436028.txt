Well, good morning, you all. My name is Terrence Little and I serve here at McLean as pastor of ministries and it is a joy and a blessing to be with you today. Today, we continue with our series entitled, Glorify and Enjoy, where we are preaching through our mission statement. Last Sunday, Pastor Ryan gave the first message on glorifying and enjoying God. And today, we focus on by making disciples. And I invite you to have your Bibles open today. And if you have your Bible app, to have your Bible app on for those who don't have the physical hard copy in their hands, because we're gonna look around the Bible a bit in our message today. Now, I invite you to bow with me before God Almighty. Heavenly Father, we come to your word to speak to your people. Open our ears to hear your truth. Open our hearts to embrace and love your truth and work in our wills to follow Christ always. This we pray in Jesus' name, amen. In September of 2018, I was up in Frederick, Maryland at a shop having some work done on a truck that I had at that time. The manager who was taking care of my truck and all of my information, he was very polite and eagerly engaged me in conversation. Over the course of the conversation, I began to notice that he began asking very pointed questions, questions that strategically moved to the subject of God and Jesus. And the gospel. His name was Lawrence. And Lawrence did not know at the time while he was talking to me that I was a pastor. I did finally tell him, but I was initially very surprised to be in an auto mechanic shop talking about spiritual things. And secondly, I was greatly, greatly encouraged that Lawrence, this auto mechanic wanted me to know Jesus. He wanted me to be a follower of Jesus Christ. He wanted me to become a part of Christ's church. Well, what is the church? What is the church? The church is the called out assembly. I don't have time to go through the words, but come to ACE sometime, you'll hear this. The word, I'll tell you a little bit. The Hebrew word, the Hebrew word for assembly and the Greek word for congregation, it's the same word. It means the called out congregation. The church is God's called out assembly whereby God declares them consecrated to God, their faith in Jesus Christ. God is their God. And they are God's people. The Bible teaches us that Jesus, the God man is head of the church. Jesus entered this world. He became one of us to die, to save a people, his people, God's people, consisting of all those who trust Jesus Christ to be the only savior that God put forward as our substitute to take on the wrath of God against sin, our sin. 2 Corinthians 5 verse 21 says, for our sake, God made Jesus who knew no sin to be sin so that we might become the righteousness of God. Jesus is Lord and King of the church according to the scriptures. And the King has given major, major instructions to his church. I like to call them marching orders. After the resurrection, before Jesus ascends to the right hand of the father, he gave marching orders, commanding his disciples to make disciples of all nations. At McLean, we have a mission statement listed at the very front and bottom of your worship bulletin. Our mission statement says, we exist to glorify and enjoy God by making disciples who make a difference through grace, field, worship, community, and mission. This mission statement is what we commit to you all when we become members of this particular local church, which is part of Christ's universal church. When we make commitments, we do so because we believe and are convinced that the cause, purpose, the mission is true and right and worthy of endeavor. Becoming a member of McLean Presbyterian Church means that you commit to know God, to glorify God, and to make disciples of all nations. Today, today, there are five things King Jesus calls McLean to engage in when making disciples. Number one, Jesus calls McLean to make disciples. Number one, Jesus calls McLean to make disciples. Make disciples. Two Fridays ago, I gave a seminar to the high school students at the Dominion Christian School, and I asked the students this question, what is a disciple? What is a disciple? I didn't let them be quiet. I said, you're going to talk to me? One young lady, she stated confidently, a follower. I said, you're right. A disciple is a follower. In Matthew 28, verse 19, Jesus, the King, instructs his disciples to make disciples. Look right there in your Bible at verse 19. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations. Today, today, Jesus says, McLean, go therefore and make disciples of all nations. If you believe in Jesus Christ to be the son of God and the son of man and the only savior of the world, your savior, then biblically, you are a disciple, a follower of Jesus Christ. But I want you to notice something else extremely important in verse 19. Jesus wants other people to know Jesus. Amen. I'm not going to do a lot of that today, I promise. Jesus wants his disciples to tell other people about Jesus and his good news. Jesus wants his church to grow. Can you believe it? Jesus wants McLean to grow in Fairfax and Reston. In college, I was involved in a ministry called Campus Outreach, and our singular focus was discipleship, discipleship, which is what you do when you disciple people. Which is what you do when you disciple people. Our emphasis was on life-on-life ministry. In this book right here, entitled Discipling by Mark Dever, I commend it to each and every one of you. And I should say, please forgive me because I should have bought them and had them ready for you. I apologize. But I commend this to each and every one of you. Mark Dever is the pastor of Capitol Hill Baptist down in the district. In this book, Mark Dever defines discipling as helping others to follow Jesus. Helping others to follow Jesus. Discipleship, you all, is intentional and strategic. Did you know that discipleship is occurring every day all around us? Every day all around us. Think of it this way. If a business owner wants his or her business to be a success, they have to meticulously teach their business to other people. I love to cook. I love to watch the cooking shows too. A chef essentially disciples a chef in training so that they will become a master in the culinary arts. But the training takes time and intentionality. Discipleship is a lifestyle and a process. Jesus invested his life into 12 men over the course of three years. We know that one was the son of destruction and walked away. He ate with them. He taught them. They accompanied him almost everywhere he went. And he taught them to make other disciples, other followers of Jesus. My parents discipled me first by teaching me the Bible, praying with me, praying for me, directing me toward Jesus Christ. My grandparents and extended family members who were followers of Jesus, they did exactly the same. In college, Blair Burke spent time teaching me how to study the Bible, how to talk to others about Jesus. He invited me into a discipleship group with Jeremiah Hopes, Rob Yancy, Kevin Wimbish, and a number of other guys during my years in college. He discipled me. He invested time in my life, directing me to follow Jesus. And he taught me to do the same with others. Discipleship, you all, is how the church grows in maturity and in number. Discipleship is how the church of Christ grows in maturity and number. It was Jesus's plan to use his disciples to make other disciples. That means that in order to disciple others, you first must be a disciple of Jesus. You, you, you must know Jesus is your Lord, your King, your Savior, your brother, and even your friend. Jesus intends for you, McLean, individually and collectively to make disciples, to invest his truth and good news in other people. Matthew 28 verses 19 to 20 tell us that we make disciples by baptism and teaching. Baptism is the covenant sign and seal commanded by King Jesus when bringing new disciples and their children into the church, the family of God, the called out ones. Baptism is done in the name of the Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. And it says we belong to God as Christ's followers. God is our God, and we are God's covenant people. Teaching is that absolutely essential element in the Christian church. I can't say this enough. Jesus says in verse 20, teaching them to observe, that is to pay attention to, to obey everything all that I have commanded you, that Christ has commanded. Disciples of Jesus invest their minds in the word of God, the Bible, and they teach others the word of God. The apostle Paul wrote in Romans 10, faith comes from what? Hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ. First Peter 3 verse 18 says, but grow in what? In the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Romans 12 verse 2 says, do not be conformed to this world, other voices, discipling and teaching us every single day, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Amen. The Bible is absolutely necessary for new disciples of Christ to be made. Discipleship is a process. And today I want to share with you the process that I learned and that I still use today. It's called the four E's, evangelize, establish, equip, export. This process is all over the Bible. So you'll want to keep your Bible handy. All right, all right. Number two, Jesus calls McLean to evangelize others. Number two, Jesus calls McLean to evangelize others. Since discipleship is a process, the first step in that process is evangelize. It is evangelized. What does it mean to evangelize? Evangelism is simply teaching people the Bible and its central message. When we evangelize, we tell people the great storyline of the Bible, which is the storyline of human history, creation, fall, redemption, new creation. When we evangelize, we teach people the gospel, the good news about Jesus. And we beckon others to trust in Jesus as the only true Lord and Savior of our missing the mark of the standard of God. When we evangelize, we share with people what the Bible teaches about what's wrong with humanity. We teach our desperate need for forgiveness from God and that Jesus paid the price for that forgiveness with his life. In college, campus outreach taught us to have investigative Bible studies in our dormitories. And we would walk people through the Bible, books of the Bible. And wouldn't you know it? God would save people. I like to call it, he turned the lights on. I saw people every single semester changed, changed. Their whole orientation to life brought into focus. Life changed. And they told others about Jesus. In order to evangelize, let me say this. I had to write it down because I forgot this morning. We spend time with Jesus. Fullness, I heard a man say many years ago, fullness has the propensity to overflow. When you spend time with Jesus, real good time with Jesus, you can't help but share that with somebody else. Don't let fear stop you. Keep spending time with Jesus. And I have to say this, we love to share with others what it is that we're excited with, don't we? Amen. You can say amen, I know it's true. Telling others about Jesus, helping others to follow Jesus. Have you considered your families, your friendships, your neighbors? Do they know Jesus? Have you ever considered inviting them over for a meal to tell them about Jesus? My friend Rob Yensley says, everybody's got to eat, amen. Jesus calls McLean to evangelize others. Number three, Jesus calls McLean to establish disciples. Jesus calls McLean to establish disciples. New followers of Jesus must be established in their identity in Christ. Turn in your Bible to Colossians chapter one, verse 21. Colossians chapter one, verse 21. The Apostle Paul writing to this church in Colossae, and you who once were alienated and hostile in mind doing evil deeds. This is life without Christ. It is a life of rebellion to God, separation from God. It means we don't love him. It is the condition of every single human being in this world apart from Christ. This was us, and it may still be some of you. Lawrence, the mechanic, he was very honest with me in that shop that day about how empty his life was before he came to trust in Jesus. Look, look there at verse 22, Colossians one, verse 22. Paul says, he meaning Jesus has now reconciled in his body of flesh by his death in order to present you holy and blameless and above reproach before him, meaning God. Jesus has accomplished something for you. Reconciliation, the broken relationship between you and God is fixed. Many years ago, I was up in Ohio and I was discipling three guys who were in college and I was talking with them, one in particular. It was very vivid to me. We were in the kitchen. It was, we had a bunch of people over to the house and his name was Angelo. And Angelo loved to talk about worship and just elated in God, which is good. Now, don't get me wrong, but I wanted to challenge him one day. I said, Angelo, what do you think would happen if you were standing before God Almighty right now, apart from Christ? Apart from Christ. I didn't say apart from Christ. No, I didn't. That's what I meant. But I said, right now. And he said, oh, I would worship. I would bow down. I said, you would be obliterated. God is holy. And if Jesus is not our mediator between us and God, judgment is our reward. Jesus has reconciled us to God. Jesus has accomplished this work for you to present you holy and blameless and above reproach before God and discipleship. We want to establish new followers of Jesus in the firm and permanent identity that they now have in Jesus, that they are united to Jesus forever. Disciples of Jesus must be established in the pursuit of maturity. It's why we're here today. Look with me at Colossians chapter one, verse 28. Paul says, him we proclaim. Jesus, we proclaim warning everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom that we may present everyone what mature in Christ. We want followers of Christ to mature in their faith. Look at Colossians two, verses six and seven. Therefore, as you received Christ Jesus, the Lord, so what walk in Jesus rooted and built up in Jesus and established in the faith, just as you were taught. Maturity is the aim. Maturity is the apple seed grown to an apple tree, producing apples with seeds so that other apple trees and apples can be produced. And the cycle go on and on. Maturity is the process of a young child growing into adulthood. Jesus calls McLean to establish disciples. Number four, Jesus calls McLean to equip disciples. Disciples must be equipped to live the Christian life and to make disciples. In 2000, in May of 2008, I flew up to New York. I was working at the children's home. Then I flew up with eight other coworkers to get trained in this course called the sanctuary model over the course of a week. And one of the things I vividly remember is something they taught us in the training. We were given a mental toolbox, if you will. They called it the sanctuary toolbox that contained a number of methods for handling the different situations that we dealt with at the children's home so that our working together and with our clients would be better. If the model was to be successful, though, we had to use the toolbox. Jesus, King Jesus has given us a toolbox. What are our tools to make disciples and accomplish our marching orders? Turn to Acts chapter two, verse 42. Acts chapter two, verse 42. And there, the author Luke has written this. And they, new disciples, new followers of Jesus, they devoted themselves to the apostles teaching and fellowship to the breaking of bread and the prayers, the word of God, God's instruction for his people. We like to call it theology, prayer. He gave them pastor teachers. He gave them other believers for fellowship. And I also add in this toolbox, King Jesus' expectations to mature in the faith, to grow in our knowledge of God and Christ, to be anchored in the truth, to study the Bible, to pray, to be in fellowship with each other as the church, to keep the toolbox close at all times. At McLean, we have a number of ways to equip followers of Jesus. Let me rehearse just a few. We have Sunday morning worship where we sing and pray and preach. We have children's ministry and children's Sunday school to shape our children in the word of God. We have student ministries where there is Christian education and discipleship groups. We have young adult ministries with round table and Bible studies that pastor Joe leads. We have journey groups, women's Bible studies, cross trainers, mops, moms connect, faith and fatherhood. I could go on and on. Are you involved in them? Amen. Are you involved in any of those? When I became a Christian, my grandmother told me, my dad's mom, Mama Lou, Mama Lou said, get up in the morning, get your Bible and a pen and a notebook and read a passage and write down what you think. When I, in the summer of 1997, Blair Burke taught me a method for studying the Bible verse by verse and all these years later, it is what I teach to other people. And I'll tell you another thing, it's exactly what I do when I prepare for sermons. I learned it in 1997. We must be equipped and we must avail ourselves to be equipped. Every day, every other voice, smartphone, news media, social media, powerfully disciples us and our children. And the messages we learn are devastatingly destructive. Jesus calls them a claim to equip disciples. And I didn't write this down, but I got to tell you, we live in an area of the world where decisions are made that often affect the world. Are we equipped? Are we equipped to go into those areas? Number five, Jesus calls them a claim to export disciples. Jesus calls them a claim to export disciples. After disciples are called out of the world to faith in Christ, established and equipped, then they are prepared to be exported. In Christian ministry, I like to ask this question, where are we taking Christ's followers? How are we moving you all along in the discipleship process, including exporting? Followers of Jesus must be mobilized to go out and evangelize, establish and equip others. In 2 Timothy chapter two, verse two, Paul teaches Timothy and what you've heard from me in the presence of many witnesses and trust to faithful men who'll be able to teach others also evangelize, establish, equip, export. Matthew 28 verse 19 can also be read in this way you all, as you are going, as you live, as you go about your life, while you are making your way through life, make disciples in your family, your friends, among your friends in your neighborhoods, at your job, make disciples. As you go, I want you to remember the authority of Christ. All authority in heaven on earth belongs to Christ. He sets the agenda for his church. He sends his disciples out literally to the uttermost parts of the earth to do what? To gather a people, other followers from every nation, tribe, people, and language. As you go, remember Jesus went to those in spiritual darkness to make disciples and so do you. As you go, remember Jesus taught and he called people to follow him and so do you. As you go, remember to trust the words of Jesus. In John 10 verse 16, he says, I've got other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also and they'll listen to my voice. So there'll be one flock, one shepherd. Remember you all that only God saves people, you and I can save nobody. But Jesus will bring people to himself through us as we give them his word and he assures us those who are his will listen. They'll respond accordingly. Jesus calls McLean to export disciples. I want to close with two paragraphs, you all. I'm almost done. This comes from the master plan of evangelism by Robert Coleman. When we realize that evangelism is not done by something, when will we realize that evangelism is not done by something but by someone? It is an expression of God's love and God is a person. His nature being personal is only expressed through personality. First revealed fully in Christ and now expressed through his spirit in the lives of those yielded to Christ. Committees may help to organize and direct it and to that end, they certainly are needed but the work itself is done by people reaching other people for Christ. The last paragraph I share with you is this. The world is desperately seeking someone to follow. That they will follow someone is certain but will that person be one who knows the way of Christ or will he or she be one like themselves leading them only on into greater darkness? Christ calls us to go and make disciples. Would you pray with me? Our Father and our God, enable us, enable us, Father, to glorify and enjoy you by making disciples who make a difference through worship, community, and mission. This we ask in Jesus' name, amen.
