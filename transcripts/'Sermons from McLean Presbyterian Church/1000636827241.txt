Good morning. Our passage this morning is Galatians chapter six, verses 11 through 18. Galatians chapter six. See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand. It is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh who would force you to be circumcised and only in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. For even those who are circumcised do not themselves keep the law, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh. But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ by which the world has been crucified to me and I to the world. For neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation. And as for all who walk by this rule, peace and mercy be upon them and upon the Israel of God. From now on, let no one cause me trouble for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Let's pray. Father, we thank you for your word. We ask that you would open our hearts and our eyes that we might behold wonderful things in this portion of your word for us. We ask it in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, first of all, happy Thanksgiving to you all. I am thankful for you and thankful that you allow me to be your pastor. I love doing it and I love opening the word of God with you when I have the opportunity. And I have really enjoyed the book of Galatians, but all good things must come to an end, at least for our purposes. You can keep reading it as long as you want, but we're gonna finish up today the book of Galatians. It has been such a fruitful study for me personally. I'm in this very inconvenient situation in which I have to listen to my own sermons and apply them. And so it's been challenging, but it's been really refreshing just to return to these very basic things about the grace of God and the way that it changes us. So hopefully if you've been with us, it's been encouraging for you too. We notice in this final portion of the letter that Paul is going to end with a flourish. We believe that Paul dictated most of his letters. And so sometimes you'll read things like verse 11, where he will literally take the pen from the person writing on paper and he will start writing himself. Sometimes it's just his name that gets signed off at the end, but sometimes he gets a little carried away. And so here in this letter, it's not surprising in Galatians he's still a little fired up by chapter six, verse 11. And so he writes really the final portion of this letter as we understand it in his own writing. And he writes it, he says, in large letters, which would be the equivalent of texting somebody in all caps, okay? Or writing a note with lots of exclamation points. It's his way of saying, you really need to hear this. I want your undivided attention because what he's really doing in these final verses is summing up everything that's come before. And he's doing it with an implied question that I want us to think about this morning. The question is, what are you boasting in? What are you boasting in? Now, I think most of us were raised right. And so our first answer to that question is, well, I'm not boasting in anything because no one likes a bragger. Like someone taught you that along the way, maybe your parents taught you that, maybe your t-ball coach taught you that after you flipped the bat, after getting your first hit in a t-ball. Like no one likes a bragger, no one likes to show off, let the bat do the talking. Maybe your friends remind you of that often when you begin a sentence with, I don't mean to brag, but, and then you go on to name drop or state something that you just did. It's like, well, now you're bragging. So if you didn't mean to, maybe you shouldn't. And so your friends call you out on that. And so our initial reaction to this question of, what are you boasting in? It feels like the right answer should be, I don't boast in anything. But Paul doesn't give us that option. Paul says that you are either boasting in yourself or you're boasting in Jesus. What does it mean to boast in yourself? Well, it's helpful to know that Paul isn't so much talking about cockiness as confidence. So he's not just talking about telling everybody how awesome you are, every opportunity you have. He's talking more about showing everybody in a much more sophisticated, understated way, how awesome you are, and making sure people understand how awesome you are. I think about it like I think about the first time I walked down the hallway of high school as a freshman with my varsity letter jacket on. So way back then, that was kind of a big thing. I'm not sure it's a big thing, status symbol anymore. I don't mean to brag or anything, but the fact of the matter is there are only two freshmen who had a varsity letter jacket, like Arthur and me. And so I felt like kind of a big deal walking down the hallway that first time. It was like as an insecure, self-conscious, skinny 15-year-old freshman walking down the halls of high school, it's like instant confidence, right? Like instant status, instantly something you can feel okay about, even if everything else in your life isn't so great, you can feel okay about yourself in this one way. Now, nothing wrong with varsity letter jackets, nothing wrong with finding some level of pride in your accomplishments, but what Paul is talking about is the things in life that give us the deepest sense of confidence. Like the things in life that right now give you confidence to make your way through the hallways of the world. And Paul wants us to examine what those things are. He says one way to make your way in the world is to have confidence in yourself. It's what Paul means by boasting in yourself. And the poster children for boasting in yourself, at least in the book of Galatians, are the Judaizers, okay? We met them in chapter one, he names them in chapter two, he's still talking about them in chapter six. These were Christians who converted out of Judaism, who made their way to Galatia, they were teaching these Christians who converted out of a Gentile background that in order to be fully Christian, you had to first become somewhat Jewish. So yes, to be accepted by God, you had to embrace Jesus as your Lord and Savior, and you needed to add certain works of the law. And at the top of that list, circumcision. That's why he keeps talking about it, even at the end of the letter, he's still talking about it because Paul has been refuting this view of Christianity all the way through this letter. He's been saying, no, what I taught you and what you need to know is the good news of the gospel, that we are justified, we're made right with God by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone. So that your source of confidence before God and before one another is not all the things that you do, it's what Jesus has done for you. Continues to do for you through the Holy Spirit and will one day bring to a culmination when he welcomes you into his kingdom forever. That's your confidence. But the Judaizers are telling the Galatians, actually you should find your greatest confidence in what you have done. Now Paul's been saying that for a while, but here he kind of goes below the surface and he explains to them what's really going on below the surface. He says, these false teachers make it sound like they're just really interested in being pious and really interested in glorifying God. What they're really doing is boasting in themselves, like this is about them. Verse 12, it is those who want to make a good showing. It's a good show. It's a performance. It's a way of presenting yourself to the right people in the right way. In fact, he says at the end of that verse, they're seeking to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ. You have to understand, the Judaizers had a base, right? They had like a political base back in Jerusalem. And they needed to keep the base happy. And in order to keep the base happy, they needed to tell them that the Galatians were coming around to their way of thinking. And that looked really good in the newsletter, back to home base, back to Judaizer National Party or the Circumcision Central Command, the CCC, as it was known back then, right? Like they needed to know that the Galatians were getting with the program, why? Because it made them look good. And it made them feel right. And it kept them from being persecuted, from suffering. He even goes on to say in verse 13, that their desire is to boast in your flesh. Now, this all sounds like very far removed from our lives. And I can understand that. These aren't the sorts of conversations that you had over Thanksgiving dinner, I hope. But we can understand why Paul would say earlier in this letter, to boast in yourself, to live in a way that says we're justified by our works. He compares it to slavery. He compares it to bondage. And we see the reasons why here. Because if your life is about keeping up appearances so you impress the right people, you and I know perfectly well how that enslaves us to the opinion of other people. How we live for what other people think about us. See, the human heart has a way of doing this. We can take perfectly good things, like circumcision, and we can make them ultimate things. And it goes from something we do out of a heart that's liberated by the gospel. We make it into something that we have to do and that other people have to do as well. We become controlling people like they are. We become hypocrites like they are, verse 13. Even those who are circumcised, they don't keep the whole law. They're acting like they do, but they don't. Why? Just to keep up appearances. We do this with perfectly good things. We can do this with physical fitness. You know, the new year is right around the corner, so probably on your list somewhere of your resolutions is gonna be finally get into shape, or get back into shape, or get the diet sorted out, or get back in the gym, or make good on that gym membership, whatever. Physical fitness, good thing. God wants us to take care of our bodies, to be careful about what we put into our bodies. He wants us to have physical strength so that we can serve him in all kinds of different ways. It's a good thing. But we all know how quickly something like physical fitness quickly becomes not just a good thing that we want to do to be good stewards because something we have to do, like how a diet can just take over your life completely, how other people perceive your physical appearance can dominate your thoughts all the time, how something good can become ultimate, how something good becomes something we ultimately find our greatest confidence in, and it enslaves us rather than liberating us. That's what Paul is warning us against. It's what he's asking us. Do you boast in yourself? Or, he says, do you boast in Jesus? Paul says, I would have it no other way, verse 14. Far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. It's interesting that Paul singles out the cross. He doesn't say boast in the ethical teaching of Jesus, as good as that is, or the great miracles of Jesus, as wonderful as those are. He says the cross of Jesus, which in his day and age would have sounded really, really odd because the cross was the most humiliating, excruciating way to die. It was designed to publicly shame people and to make them experience as much pain as possible for as long as possible before they finally died. And Paul is saying, actually, my boast, my greatest source of confidence is that my savior, the one I claim to be king and redeemer died like that. The only reason that makes sense is if you understand what Jesus did on the cross. As Paul's been teaching throughout this entire letter, Jesus died on the cross in our place. He died for our sins, that we might experience forgiveness, we might be given his righteousness, that we might be redeemed. In fact, Paul would say it was on the cross that Jesus proved how much God loves us. Romans 5, verse 8, but God demonstrates his own love for us in this, that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Paul says, you know, if you want confidence to make your way in this crazy world, you can do the mad scramble of trying to find reasons to find confidence in yourself, good luck with that, or you can look to the cross and you can have confidence in any circumstance that God loves you, that he's taking care of you, that he delights in you, that you have an inheritance in him forever. They might say, well, okay, you know, I guess, I guess I believe that, or I'm willing to consider that possibility, but what difference does that really make, to not boast in yourself, but to boast in Jesus? Well, Paul says it to, explains the difference it makes in verse 14, when he goes on to say, the cross by which the world has been crucified to me and I to the world, now you have to understand, Paul's applying this idea of union with Christ, that when we place our faith in Christ, it's as if we died with him on the cross, okay, that's the concept he's working with. And what he's saying is in that moment, the world was crucified to us and we were crucified to the world. Some of you probably familiar with the phrase, you're dead to me, I would not recommend saying it to anybody, but maybe you've heard it in a movie or something like that, maybe someone said it to you, and if they have, you know how painful something like that would be, because to say that to somebody is basically to say, I'm gonna live as if you don't exist, like your opinion doesn't move me in any way, your existence doesn't move me in any way, you're dead to me, so I would not recommend saying that to anyone else, but Paul is saying this about the world, he's saying the world, it's dead to me, like the world's demands on my life, I don't care about it, what the world expects of me by way of success, by way of security, yeah, that doesn't apply to me anymore, what the world says I have to be in order to be a successful person, or a lovable person, or an attractive person, yeah, that just doesn't have sway with me anymore, because Jesus, Jesus' love is mine, God's opinion is the only opinion I live for anymore, and that opinion is secure in Jesus, so I don't play that game anymore, and so the world is dead to me, and by the way, I'm dead to the world, the world looks at me and it says, well, he or she doesn't really play by the rules anymore, and that person's really weird for not thinking this way about marriage and sexuality, and they're giving their money away rather than keeping it all for themselves, that's just odd to us, makes no sense to us, so in a sense, we're also dead to the world, the world's dead to us, we're dead to the world, and you're thinking, well, that really makes you a pleasant sort of person, doesn't it? That really makes you the kind of person you wanna be around, the world's dead to me, I'm dead to the world, you think, well, that probably means that you spend all of your time telling the world to get off your lawn, like just angry, cantankerous, bitter, always thinking about spiritual things, never thinking about lost in the clouds, actually, no, the difference that it makes to boast in Jesus in this way means that we are now free to enjoy the world, not as an entitlement we have to have, but as a gift from the one who gives us all things. It's actually the cross that liberates us to be grateful people for the good gifts of art and music and food and drink and a Thanksgiving table and a church that we can be part of and brothers and sisters in Christ and relationships, not with a death grip because we have to have it, but with the open hands of gratitude. It's the cross who gives us that. Paul even says it in verse 17 when he says, "'From now on, let no one cause me trouble, "'for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.'" He's probably taking one last shot at the Judaizers here, they're saying the mark, the true mark of Jesus' circumcision, literally, he's saying actually no, the real mark are those who suffer for the gospel because he's talking about the scars in his body that he has picked up along the way because he's been beaten and left for dead more than once because he preaches the cross of Christ. But by saying that, notice what he's doing, he's including not just those who are Jewish Christians, but those who are Gentile Christians within what he calls in verse 16, the Israel of God, the people of God. This goes back to chapter three when Paul said all who have faith in Jesus are the true sons of Abraham. Doesn't matter what your background is, your class, your ethnicity, you, if you belong to Jesus, you are the true Israel of God. It means we can face even suffering in life with hope because when the circumstances of our lives change, the pain of the cross remains the same. It's Thanksgiving Sunday, so I brought a little show and tell I know we got a few extra kids here, so show and tell is always good for kids and adults. I see all you adults waking up right now, get off your phone to look up here, you crazy kids. All right, I brought with me today a little, a photograph. So this is a photograph, you see that? So this is a photograph of me in high school with a couple of my friends, we were part of a little FCA group and that's me in the middle and guess what I'm wearing? My letter jacket, it's right there, but I'm a senior at this point, it's broken in a little more, it's not quite as big of a deal as it was back when I was a freshman, but I'm wearing it. And then I noticed as I was looking at this picture the other day that I'm also holding something in my arms, I kind of have my arms crossed like that, I'm holding something in my arms and I knew immediately what it was, it was this Bible right here. So this is my NIV study Bible that was my Bible in high school and probably for most of my college years and young adult years. And it was interesting to me that here in this photo, here I am, high school senior, about to launch into the next phase of life and I have no idea where that letter jacket is. No idea, goodwill, bottom of some box, in a closet, maybe, I haven't seen it in 30 years, so I have no idea where it is. But I can tell you, I knew right where this Bible was. It suggests that even then, like way back then, I had an inkling that things like letter jackets as a source of inspiration for me I had an inkling that things like letter jackets as a source of confidence, they come and go, you know? Like there was a time when you were probably really, really, really proud of the diploma on your wall. Like that was the thing, like when people walked in, you're like, you know, right, check it out. And now it's like, yeah. Or maybe there's a time when like your title, that's what just made you walk a little taller, back a little straighter, you know? Your title in your jacket, you're like, yeah. Maybe you don't have it anymore or maybe it's just kind of like, yeah. Or maybe it was your portfolio or maybe it was, maybe it was your looks and I mean, for a lot of us, it's like, eh, that's long gone now, right? These things come and go. That's what Paul's saying, like, you can play that game if you wanna play that game, but it's a letter jacket today, it's something else tomorrow, but it is not enough to bear the weight of your confidence. But Jesus Christ is the same, yesterday, today, forever. He will be your confidence today and he will be your confidence forever. Well, herein ends the book of Galatians and I thought I would read as our final prayer, Paul's final prayer for us. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers and sisters, amen.
