Good morning, you all. My name is Terrence Little, and I serve here at McLean as a pastor of ministries, and it is a privilege to be among you today. We are preaching currently through the gospel of Mark. And last week, one of the things Pastor Ryan pointed out with the healing of blind Bartimaeus was that Jesus is the Son of David, the Son of David, the King, meaning the King of Israel. And today, we're going to see more about Jesus, the King. Today, we're gonna see more about Jesus, the King, and I invite you to bow with me in prayer. Father, our Father and our God, give light from your Word and by your Spirit that we might see Jesus Christ, the King, for who he is. This we pray in Jesus' name, amen. There are three things I want us to see in our scripture passage today. There are three things I want us to see in our scripture passage today. Number one, the King's humility. Number two, the King's zeal. And number three, the King's lesson. Our passage starts with two seemingly opposite attributes, if you will. Humility and King, meekness and royalty, modesty and majesty. As we begin, we are introduced to the King's humble taxi. You could think of it as his Uber or his Lyft, if you will. Jesus and his disciples make their way to Jerusalem, to the great capital city of Israel. If we were to take a walk down Mark's gospel of memory lane, we'll take note of the amazing works and miracles that Jesus did among the people all around the region of Galilee and Samaria. He healed diseases. He brought people back to life. He fed thousands. He controlled the weather. His teaching was unlike any the people had ever heard. He spoke with commanding authority in such a way that it not only captivated his listeners, but nature itself listened and obeyed. And now in his journey, Jesus comes to the great city of Jerusalem. He comes to Zion, in case any of you ever wondered, well, what is Zion? Zion is a nickname, so to speak, for Jerusalem. Jesus makes preparation for how he will enter Jerusalem. He chooses for his taxi, his Uber, his Lyft. I think that's pretty comical. But he chooses a lowly beast of burden, the colt of a donkey, a colt no one has ever sat on. Well, why, why? Why does Jesus choose the colt of a donkey? 500 years before this moment, the prophet Zechariah spoke words of hope to the people of Israel who had just come out of exile in Babylon. They had been disciplined by God, and now they'd returned, and Zechariah gives them this word. Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion. Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem. Behold, your king is coming to you, righteous and having salvation is he, humble and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey. Jesus fulfills Zechariah's prophecy about him in order to demonstrate to the people exactly who Jesus is. For those who knew the law and the prophets, for those paying attention, they would recognize Jesus as their promised king. The colt served as an indicator, as an indicator, as a sign of the king of Zion. When Jesus chooses an animal associated with humility, with one who bears burdens, sometimes extremely heavy burdens as one travels from one place to another, Mark teaches here that Jesus is the king who brings salvation, which means deliverance. At some point, I wanna teach an ace class on deliverance, which means rescue, rescue. Jesus brings rescue to his people, and he comes to Jerusalem riding not on a mighty horse, characteristic of a king or a grand chariot, but riding on the back of the foal of a donkey. Well, Jesus knows it's time to enter the city on his humble taxi to begin the road that will lead to the deliverance and the rescue of the people of God, and as we will see both Jew and Gentile. Well, next, the scene brings us to see the humble king greeted as a king. Jesus chooses his humble taxi to enter the city of Jerusalem. The disciples bring him the colt, and they place cloaks and garments on its back so that he can ride on it, and Jesus descends the Mount of Olives, which faces the temple, riding up into the city of Jerusalem, right in the direction of the temple, in the sight of everyone, and as he rides along, there are large groups of people in front of him, and there are large groups of people behind him, and they're taking their cloaks, and they're lining the roadway before him as he comes through, as if to roll out the red carpet, as you would for a king. They take large leafy branches, and then they place them in the road. Why? Why? Well, notice what they say. Notice what they say. They shout, Hosanna, which means save us, save us. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Blessed is the coming of the kingdom of our father, David. Hosanna, or save us, in the highest. The people in front and the people behind, they're all shouting this out for everybody to hear. This is indeed a tremendous spectacle to behold. Before John the Baptist, no prophet had spoken in Israel for 400 years, and now the one who fulfills the words of the prophet has come. The people welcome their king. They welcome the one promised to David by God. They welcome him into the city. Jesus comes into Jerusalem, not to drive out the Roman empire or to remove Herod from power. It's not why he enters the city at this time. Jesus has greater work to do his focus and his concerns about issues far, far deeper and infinitely greater than these. And this moves us in our passage to the zeal of King Jesus, the king's zeal. You see this in verse 11 and in verses 15 to 19. Well, what is zeal? What is zeal? And rather than giving you a definition, I want you to see it emerge from the passage. And as we walk through these verses, I want you, there are two aspects that I'm gonna point out, but I want you to understand them as Jesus' zeal for the purposes of God. Jesus' zeal for the purposes of God. Our concern is found in verses 11 and 15 through 19. Here we're looking at how Jesus enters the temple when he comes into Jerusalem and when he cleanses the temple. Well, what occurs at the temple, what occurs with Jesus at the temple is extremely significant. When Jesus arrives in the city, he goes into the temple, he looks around at the situation and you know it was evening so he couldn't do what he needed to do, but he left, but he came back the next day. He came back the next day. And here it's significant to see that he makes time to go up into the temple, the place where sacrifices were to occur, the place where the presence of God would come down in the Holy of Holies and dwell among the people, the place where the high priest entered once a year to make atonement for the sins of the people, a temple like the tabernacle that preceded it was to be a sacred and special place. It was a space dedicated to deafening reverence for the worship purposes of God. Well, first, our passage shows Jesus has zeal for the house of the Lord. First thing Jesus did when he went into Jerusalem was go up into the temple. He didn't deal with what he saw on the first day, as I told you, because it was late, but he would come back the next day. He had major concern for what was going on in the temple. Well, what happens? There are merchants inside the temple carrying on their money making businesses. People are buying and they are selling merchandise, even pigeons. I have to tell you, when you read the Bible, sometimes funny things pop up and I thought that was pretty funny. Even pigeons are in there. It'd be like a department store taking up residence here in our sanctuary on the Lord's day, buying and selling, buying and selling with no reverence or thought for God at all. If we were to do such and people came here, they would think, well, this is not a church. It's not a place of worship. Jesus the King sees this activity with his own eyes and he is infuriated, infuriated. This is not the way it's supposed to be. He turns over the tables. He flips over the cash registers, if you will. The seats where the merchants were sitting, he turns them over, kicks them over and he drives them out of the temple. Mark writes that Jesus began to teach saying this, is it not written, my house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations. But you've made it a den of robbers. You've made it a den of thieves. The house of the Lord was to be a place of worship, of prayer, of sacred reverence to God. The temple came to be treated whatever ways the chief priests and scribes and the people desired for their own purposes and not God's purposes. When I was writing this, this came to my mind. You know how you feel and how you respond when you see something incredibly beautiful and valuable treated in a dishonoring and desecrating way. You know how that feels. It'd be like taking fine silk clothes and giving it to a pig, out in the pig to style. It'd be like giving dazzling diamonds, priceless emeralds and rubies and gold to cows out grazing in the pasture. It's inappropriate is the point. It's inappropriate, it's not proper. God's purpose for the temple had been cheapened. It had been distorted. It had been treated in an unworthy manner. Well, we also see that Jesus has zeal for the nations. Not just the house of the Lord, but he has zeal for the nations. Notice he's teaching these people now in the temple. House of God is to be called a house of prayer for all the nations. Meaning, God has plans for the nations. God has plans for the nations. I think you should keep that in mind as our missions conference approaches. In Zechariah chapter nine, verse 10, the verse after the other verse I quoted in Zechariah about him coming on a donkey, the prophet says that the prophesied king will also speak peace to the nations. Jesus will speak shalom to the nations. God will bring salvation. He's gonna bring deliverance, not only for Israel, but for the nations. You remember how the gospel of Mark begins? You remember how the book begins? He says, the beginning of the gospel, the good news, the good proclamation, the good tidings of Jesus Christ, the son of God. Jesus the king has entered Jerusalem to fulfill the task given to him by God, which entails fulfilling all that was written and foretold about Jesus, which will ultimately lead him to his death. Jesus is good news. Jesus is good news for all people. Profaning of the temple, the profaning of the temple, you all, hurts the witness of God for the nations, as it does us when we do the same. In Genesis, God promised to bless the nations through Abraham. The Old Testament people of God were to be a light to the nations, but as we read throughout the Old Testament, we see idolatry, failure, adultery, and judgment. Why? All because of persistent disobedience to God's covenant, to God's instruction, and yet God maintains a remnant of people who are faithful, faithful to him, faithful to his purposes, leading ultimately to the coming of Jesus the Christ, the son of God, the son of man. In Mark's gospel here, he demonstrates Jesus as the great son of David, the king who will rule forever because he is also the son of God. Jesus the king came to set things right. He came to set things in order, and we get a glimpse of that in the temple. He came to set things right, not just for Israel, but for the nations. You know, he came to bring deliverance to the nations, and it's interesting, when you're studying the scriptures, when I'm studying the scriptures and things just vividly come to me, when I was writing this, I knew this would happen. That's why we're here today. That's why we're in this building today. That good news went to the nations, and we heard about it. We came to hear the word of deliverance from our idolatries, our selfishness, our godlessness, and from the wrath of God, which we deserve. The people who sit in darkness need to see the great light of Jesus. This is Jesus's concern as he cleanses the temple and begins to teach. Now, the Old Testament and the New Testament show us that the problem with the temple here in Mark 11 is a sign, it's a pointer to the major problem. The corruption that you see in the life of the temple was due to the corruption of the heart of the people. You clearly see this with the response of the religious leaders. What do they do when they hear him doing what he's doing? They want to kill him. They want to destroy him. Here, the Savior's setting things right, and they want him gone. He's interrupting their business. He's interrupting their way of life, their particular way of doing church and faith. You know, the apostles Paul and Peter, in their letters, they teach that all people, all people are the temple of the Lord. Did you know that? Believer and unbeliever. We were made by God for God to live in our hearts. Because of what happened with our first parents in the Garden of Eden, the temple has been corrupted. We are born corrupted. We are corrupted, and we see its reality every day. It was time for the temple to return to God's purposes, and Jesus comes bringing and securing salvation for the nations, leading to the very last point, number three, the king's lesson. The king's lesson. Our passage culminates with Jesus and the fig tree. Does he hate the fig tree? Poor old little fig tree? Is Jesus being overly dramatic about the fig tree? After all, Mark writes that it was not the season for figs to be on the tree. Well, what is the point of the fig tree? What is the lesson of the fig tree in our passage? And commentators and scholars and pastors, they wrestle with this passage. I think the point is this, have faith in God. Have faith in God, trust God, believe God. Faithfulness to the Lord and his word. Have faithfulness to the Lord and his word rather than hypocrisy. R.C. Sproul, in his commentary on Mark, shares something helpful from his time in seminary that I wanted to share with you today. He had a professor who was, at that particular time, one of the premier archeologists of the 20th century. The professor informed the class that in Palestine, there is clearly a defined season for figs, and the vast majority of fig species, i.e. fig trees, types of fig trees, they bear fruit in that season. But there are a few rare species of fig trees that yield fruit outside of the normal season. The test to see if someone could expect figs from a tree was not the time of year, but the foliage of the tree to see if the foliage of the tree was in full bloom. Jesus saw the fig tree in bloom, and he expected mature figs on the tree. When there were no figs, Jesus, the Son of God and the Son of David, cursed the fig tree. It is the only New Testament miracle of destruction. Isn't that something? It's the only New Testament miracle of destruction, and it teaches the lesson of judgment. The fig tree teaches the lesson of judgment. The temple, the chief priests, the scribes, the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and many others of Israel lived in hypocrisy and rebellion to the covenant word of God. Their hearts were faith less. The external buildings, the people, they looked nice, but inside there was corruption, spiritual ruin. Trust Jesus. The Lord's great lesson is trust God, trust me, have faith. The fig tree is about faith, dependence, obedience, and Jesus demonstrates this lesson in two ways. He says, have faith in God through prayer, and have faith in God through forgiveness. Jesus intends for us to understand that in prayer, we actually make requests to God and believe that he'll answer them, that we'll trust God to answer, that we'll depend on God to answer. How the answer arrives is up to God and God's perfect wisdom. Jesus wants us to ask with a heart that trusts and depends, just like you're depending on these pews to keep you up. We're depending on this floor to keep us up. It's like a child asking daddy, mama, will you do this? Will you get this? Will you help me with this? And a good parent will meet the need of their child when the time is right. At principle, you all is exponentially more true of God. Jesus says, God is trustworthy. Jesus is trustworthy. And he came for you and I to trust him to be the savior of the world. Jesus says, have faith in God through forgiveness. He says, when you pray, when you stand praying, he says, forgive, forgive. Asking requests of our heavenly father while harboring resentment, bitterness, anger, unforgiveness does not yield the listening ear of God. Did you know that? Psalm 66 verse 18 says, if I had cherished iniquity, if I'd cherished, if I'd loved, if I'd have adored, if I'd have treasured iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not have listened. God calls us to forgive, to forgive others of their wrongs and their offenses against us. One thing I want to say, but I was reading some of these commentators and some of them disagree, so I probably won't say it. But I want you to understand, I'm almost done, I promise you, forgiveness is extremely important. Forgiveness is extremely important in the life of God's people. Verse 25 says, and whenever you stand praying, forgive. If you have anything against anyone, so that your father, who also is in heaven, may forgive you your trespasses. And that's interesting. As if to say, if you don't forgive, God won't forgive you almost, isn't it? That's what it seems to be saying. God's not gonna listen to you in your prayers if you're harboring resentment and unforgiveness. Now, please know, I know that it's not always easy to forgive, sometimes it requires years to forgive. It takes hard work, which the Holy Spirit and the Word of God are committed to do in you and me so that we can forgive others. Jesus also, by his example, teaches us that forgiveness is possible. And there are all kinds of situations and things that we endure. And yes, it's difficult at times to forgive, but we are confronted, you know, as Jesus, as the nails are being driven into his hands and his feet, you remember what he said? Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. Forgive them. McLean, following Jesus Christ is about really following Jesus Christ. It's about the lived daily life in surrender, lived in surrender to Christ, in living daily life in the scriptures, in prayer, in relationship with each other, in teaching people who don't know Jesus, teaching them who he is. The Christian life lives for King Jesus. Do you? Do you know Jesus? Are you living under his lordship today, every day? Believer, are you following our King? King has come with words of deliverance. May we follow him accordingly. Would you pray with me? Our father and our God, teach us more and more of how Jesus is, of who Jesus is. Open our hearts, our minds, our souls to know you more. Our God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, work in us so that we will shine as followers of Christ, reflecting his light and his good news to the broken, the proud, the poor, the orphan, the widow, to unbelievers, and Lord, to each other. When life's struggles and obstacles seem impossible to overcome, teach us to remember our King, who is even now seated in heaven, making intercession for us today. Lead us this day, this week, in the name of Jesus, King Jesus, whom we follow and pray. Amen and amen.
