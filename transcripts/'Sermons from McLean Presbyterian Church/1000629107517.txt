When I was growing up, one of my favorite movies, I was a weird kid, one of my favorite movies was Chariots of Fire. I know, I had high standards as a young child. I'll prove it to you, when I was probably eight or nine years old, my elementary school had a little fun run. And so we had to enter a team of young fourth graders or something like that to this race. And so we named ourselves Chariots of Fire. That's how highly I viewed this movie. And at the time, I think probably the scene I had in mind when I picked that name was the opening scene, when they're running on the beach and the iconic synthesizer begins to swell and the Chariots of Fire music begins. I was mentioning this to Jake, our director of student ministry. He's like, oh yeah, the youth run on that beach all the time when we go to Scotland, it's in St. Andrews. And so, oh yeah, right, he sent me a video of some of the high school boys running on that beach with the Chariots of Fire music underneath. So I see you, well done, I'm not the only one. Because that scene is just, it's such an inspiring beginning to the movie. It's beautiful, these guys are clearly having fun, which is misleading. They're running and having fun at the same time. But what's before them is the 1924 Olympics and they're gonna go there and many of them are gonna win gold medals. It's really a great beginning to a great movie. And I had these images in our mind, in my mind as I imagined little fourth graders running around the track. Now, I can tell you for sure, the scene I did not have in mind is actually the one that I think about more now, 40 years later. And the scene I think about more now, 40 years later, isn't the Eric Little scene that you're thinking of, it's actually another runner, Harold Abrahams. So in the movie, Harold Abrahams is this obsessive, focused, compulsive, I don't know why in DC we would relate to these sorts of people, but you're like highly competitive, highly dedicated, all in kind of runner. And he, an hour before his final race, the 100 meters, he's having this conversation. And if you've seen the movie, you know this is actually a very vulnerable conversation for him to have. He has his guard down for one of the only times in the film. And he speaks to one of the other characters about how he's feeling in this moment as he's getting ready to run, literally the race of his life. And he says to his teammate, in a few minutes, I will raise my eyes and I will look down that corridor, four feet wide, and I will have 10 lonely seconds to justify my existence. And then he asks the question, but will I? Now, yes, it's a movie. Yes, it's dramatic. Yes, he probably never said that, but there's a sense in which what he is articulating is what all of us experience every single day of our lives. That's not just the stuff of Hollywood. That's not just the stuff of made up movies. This is the stuff of real life. Like whether we realize it or not, all of us are engaged in this race to justify our existence. And we do it in all sorts of different ways. Some of us through athletic achievement at some point in our lives, for sure. Probably most of us in other ways of working this out, we try to justify our existence. Many of us who are parents by raising great kids, like if that would just happen, we would feel like our life is worthwhile. Or maybe we want to leave a legacy in terms of our career, in terms of our wealth, in terms of our influence on society. Like if we could just leave that behind, when we leave this planet, we would feel like we've justified our existence. Some of us don't know exactly how we need to do it or are going to do it, but it is this longing inside all of our hearts to justify our existence. And even though that's natural and normal for all of us, the problem is that behind all of those pursuits, whatever they might be, is that haunting question. But will I? Like will I be a good enough parent? Will I be a good enough kid, a good enough student? Will I achieve what I need to achieve? Will I arrive at the place I need to arrive to? See, that question haunts us. And the reason I'm bringing all this up on this rainy Sunday here in September is Paul, in this passage, wants to answer this question for you once and for all. He just wants to settle the question for you once and for all. And the way he does that is by pointing us to the way in which God settles that question for you once and for all. And so we're gonna open up, as we've already looked at this passage, we're gonna open up to Galatians chapter two. We're gonna delve into what Paul has to say about justification and why that matters. So let me pray for us. As we open God's word, let's ask for his help. Father, help us as we open your word to gain wisdom, wisdom that leads to life change. We pray, most of all, Lord, that you would help us by your spirit to have ears to hear and eyes to see that which is true and good and beautiful that you have given us in this passage. We ask it in Jesus' name. Amen. In Galatians chapter two, Paul introduces, for the first time, really, really important doctrine, the doctrine of justification. Now, I know for some of you, if you come from maybe a Presbyterian or Reformed background, this is game day for you. I mean, this is about as charismatic as you're gonna get in church. You've got sweaty palms, and you're gonna take lots of notes, all right? That's how Presbyterians show their excitement, sweaty palms, lots of notes. But if that's not your background, the word justification just kind of falls flat, like it's just not a very inspiring word in and of itself. So you should know that in church history, this has been a central doctrine to what it means to be a Christian. So Martin Luther, the great reformer, said about the doctrine of justification by faith alone, in Christ alone, it is the article upon which the church stands or falls. So we are walking into a discussion that, at least from a church history standpoint, has been very, very important and incredibly central to what it means to be a Christian and to live a Christian life. So even if you don't have sweaty palms and you're not ready to take lots of notes, lean in, because what Paul is talking about really makes a difference in our lives. And I want it to make a difference in your life as well. So we're gonna talk about it in two ways. Number one, the declaration of justification. And secondly, the difference that this declaration of justification makes, the declaration of justification and the difference justification makes. Now, I could have said the definition of justification and just put you into a deeper sleep, but I decided to use the word declaration because that's really what the word is. Like the word itself, justification, is a legal word. It is lifted from the world of the courtroom. Paul is talking here in verses 15, 16, and 17, and that's where we're gonna start this morning. We're gonna start at the end and then work our way back. He's using a word that means, basically, a declaration that says not guilty, a declaration that says you're free to go, a declaration that says you are pardoned, a declaration that you are justified. Now, if that sounds like the latest courtroom drama that you watched, either real or imaginary, you are correct. That's what Paul very much has in mind. And the scenario he wants us to put ourselves in goes something like this. In the courtroom of heaven, there is, of course, God at the bench. He is the holy judge, the just judge. And whether you like this part or not, the fact is we are the ones who are on trial. And see, the problem with this whole setup is that God is just and holy and his laws are altogether righteous and we are not. So the immediate problem you have when you are brave enough to place yourself into that scenario, and that is, in fact, what the Bible tells us is true about all of us, is that we are guilty. We know it, God knows it, everyone else knows it, your spouse definitely knows it, your kids know it, your friends know it. All of us have to own up to the fact that we are not altogether righteous and holy and just. We don't even live up to our own standards, let alone God's standards. So you have a problem, you're in a courtroom situation in which the verdict is in, and you know what the verdict is as well as I do because I know what the verdict would be for me, guilty as charged. So you can feel the tension in the courtroom begin to build as the verdict is passed to the judge and the judge reads the verdict, but here's where it gets unexpected. Here's where the plot has a little twist. The verdict is read, and the verdict which should be guilty is actually the verdict not guilty, and you hear those words come out of the mouth of the judge and you almost begin to laugh. You're like, okay, if that's the way you want it, innocent, you're free to go. You see, this is the first thing you have to know about justification. In order for justification to make any difference in your life, it has to be an unexpected declaration, right? So now, let's just imagine that scenario again, just bear with me for a second. Now, imagine the words not guilty coming out of the judge's mouth, and your first thought is, of course, as if it's a foregone conclusion, as if it's somewhere in God's job description, just let people off the hook. Well, if that's the way you approach your relationship with God, justification is never gonna mean anything significant to you. It's certainly not gonna change you in any significant way, but if when you hear him make that declaration about you, that you are justified, made right, acceptable in his sight, if that shocks you, stuns you, if you are gobsmacked, floored, almost bursting into laughter at the hilarity of the idea that you, an ungodly person, would be declared righteous in the sight of God, then justification is beginning to work its power in your heart. So think of another movie or book, if you're brave enough to read the book, go for it. If you've seen the movie Les Miserables, then we'll just work with you on that one too. But you know the scene, it's the scene we always talk about. It's the sermon illustration that just keeps on giving. It's the one where Jean Valjean is standing before, I'm gonna do the fast-forwarded version, he's standing before the priest and he is caught red-handed. Like the evidence of what he's stolen from the priest the night before, he's right there. He's in chains, he knows where he's going and he knows why, because he is guilty. And then the priest says something completely unexpected. You're free to go. He declares him innocent. And Jean Valjean doesn't just shrug his shoulders and goes, I thought it would go that way. That's what I deserved. Instead, he's undone. And it changes the course of his life forever. Do you see the difference? Now, all of this raises a second question, right? It's not so much what is justification, it is this declaration that you, even though ungodly, even though a sinner, are righteous in the sight of God. The next question though is, how does this happen? I mean, how is it that God, who is just, lets people off the hook? That doesn't seem very just. We live in a city of presidential pardons, right? So depending who's in office, you get really upset about presidential pardons or you're all for them, depending who's in office. And this is the cynical generalist speaking, but the cynical generalist would say, well, here you have somebody who's in power and he's just letting off his friends and he's just letting off his pals. That doesn't seem very just. Is that what we have here, that there's this legal fiction going on that God is just letting off his religious pals, letting off the people who show a sniff of interest in religious things, like they get to go free and everyone else doesn't get to go free? Paul is more than happy to answer that question for you right here in verse 16. We know that a person is not justified by the works of the law, but through faith in Jesus Christ. That is to say that we are not, that God does not dismiss the charges against us because of all the amazing things we have done. Rather, he dismisses the charges against us because we've placed our faith in Jesus who has obeyed the law perfectly. So God doesn't declare us innocent because we stand up under the scrutiny of God's holy law. God declares us as innocent because Jesus has stood up to the scrutiny of God's law and stood in our place and taken our place on the cross and given us his righteousness. So, we're gonna talk a lot more about justification. I don't, the good news is I don't have to take another three hours telling you everything that Galatians has to say about justification. We will spend the next number of weeks and months because Paul never really stops beating this drum for the rest of the letter. But I do wanna say this much because I think for many of us, when we hear justification, we hear we are justified by faith in Jesus, this is what we think. We think of forgiveness, okay? We think what that means when we hear justification, we think it means God says to us, you are washed because we know the hymn. What can wash away my sin? Nothing but the blood of Jesus, right? We know that one. And most of us can kind of get our heads around because we've talked about Jesus's death on our behalf so much. We can get our heads around the fact that when I ask forgiveness, God forgives me for my sin. Like we've got that part, but justification is more than forgiveness, okay? Justification is more than God saying to you, you are washed. Justification is God also saying to you, you are welcome. You are welcome. And this is why it matters. We're gonna talk about the difference it makes in a second, but I'll give you a little sneak peek. The reason this matters is many of us relate to God as if we never really left the courtroom or maybe we made it to the lobby, but that's how we conceive of our relationship with God. He's the judge. We're the guilty party that he is forgiven and sort of reconciled with. He says, you're free to go. And so we go. But justification says that our relationship with God is not only defined by the courtroom, but also the family room. That we not only have our sins forgiven once and for all, we also have the righteousness of Christ. That means that God delights in us. He marvels at us. He says to you and to me this morning, because we are in Christ, you are enough for me. You're enough for me. You'll have to work harder for me. You'll have to strive harder for me. You'll have to prove yourself to me. I delight in you. I enjoy your company. And when that message of justification begins to work its way into your heart, it makes a huge, huge, huge difference. It changes the course of your life forever. Paul's gonna describe lots of reasons why and how that's true later in the book. But here, I just wanna go back to the two case studies he gives us. Because he's giving us some moments in time when he took this law-free gospel, this message of justification, this message of free grace, when he took it on the road, all right? So this is Paul's law-free gospel tour. And the two stops that we have in this passage, Jerusalem and Antioch. And in both cases, this gospel is put to the test. And so we begin to understand the difference that it makes. Stop number one is in Jerusalem, verse one. We find out this happens 14 years after Paul has become a Christian. And he goes up to Jerusalem, which was the hub, the home of the church, and really the hub of where the Jewish Christians resided and gathered to worship. Remember, the backdrop of the New Testament is really this historical situation in which you had Jews converting to Christianity and Gentiles converting to Christianity. And so one of the questions in Galatians, for sure, but also in the rest of the New Testament is, just how Jewish do you have to be to be a Christian? Just how Jewish do you have to be? And so this is a live conversation. And so Paul is going to a place where a lot of the prominent Jewish Christians are, including the pillars of the church, including people like James and Cephas, that would be Peter, and John. And he goes to them, not to validate his ministry because he says here that Jesus has already done that. He's not looking for a stamp of approval, sign here so I can go preach to the Gentiles. He just wants to make sure they're on the same page, particularly as it relates to justification by faith alone in Christ alone. And so whether intentional or not, my thought is intentional. Paul brings Titus, okay? And when Titus arrives in Jerusalem, it causes a bit of a stir. And the reason for that is Titus, converted out of a Gentile background, is about as non-Jewish as you get in every sense of the word. Paul points that out. And so he's a test case. He's a test case whether or not the gospel is sufficient, whether or not the finished work of Christ is really sufficient to make us right with God, or do we have to do a little more? Just a few more things in order to be made right with God. So Paul, Barnabas, Titus show up in Jerusalem, and Paul tells us in verse four that some false brothers, these would be the same people who are plaguing the Galatians at this time, and telling them they have to be more Jewish before they can become a Christian, they secretly were brought in, and they were spying out, verse four, our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus so that we might be brought again into slavery. Pretty strong language when you're talking about religious people who just wanna see people living religious upright lives, but Paul says no. What's actually happening here in their pressure to have Titus circumcised, what does he say? Verse five, we did not yield in submission even for a moment so that the truth of the gospel might be preserved for you. Case study number one. Case study number two. Paul shows up in Antioch. Antioch is like the opposite of Jerusalem. It is the center of Gentile Christianity. It is the launching pad for Paul's ministry to the Gentiles, to people who've never heard of Jesus, never believed in Moses, like people who are coming out of a pagan background. That's Paul's ministry, and it starts in Antioch. In fact, Acts tells us Antioch was the first place people called Christians Christians. So Paul shows up there, and when he gets there, he sees Peter, all right? Cephas, verse 11, Cephas was there. Now, you have to know something about Peter's background. Before this, Peter has had a revelation from God, specifically, check this out, specifically about food. So he has a vision of a picnic blanket falling from heaven with all of the unclean food of the Old Testament on it, like bacon-wrapped shrimp on there, okay? Everything non-kosher, it's on there. And the voice from heaven says, take any, he goes, never, Lord, never would I do that. And finally, the Lord says, no, everything is clean. Why, because all of those laws were pointing to Jesus who would ultimately make us clean. So they're fulfilled in Christ. All food is now good for you to eat. And Peter is like, let's go, right? Because when Paul shows up and he sees Peter, Peter is eating with the Gentiles. Like he's got the bacon-wrapped shrimp, he's got a bacon cheeseburger, like no holds barred. He is eating, licking his fingers, having a grand time, eating their food. And fellowshipping with the Gentiles. Because he's already been told by God himself that the Gentiles are part of the family too, why? Because they are acceptable to me based on the finished work of Christ and nothing else. Cool, right? Until verse 12, certain men from James show up, certain men from Jerusalem show up, the same folks. And they show up, and you know that look, you guys know that look. It's the look of disapproval. The look of, hmm, should you be doing that right now? And they give Peter the look. Because they don't approve not only of the food he's eating, they don't approve of the people that he's eating with. Because in Jewish culture, to have table fellowship with somebody meant that you were down with those people, like they were your people, they were your family. That was a statement of social acceptability. Remember how much trouble Jesus got in simply by having meals with the wrong people? And now Peter's on the receiving end of that. And they look at him, and they cross their arms, and they give him whatever the sign is that means you need to leave this place immediately. And he does. He draws back, he separates himself out of fear of what they would think. And not only Peter, Paul goes on to say, Barnabas and all the other Jews. At which point, Paul did the nice thing. He pulled him aside privately, and he said, now brother, that wasn't very nice. I want you to eat with the other kids at the cafeteria. You know, they're new around here. No, what does Paul do? He gets in Peter's face. When Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face in front of everybody, verse 14. And the first thing he says is, if you, though a Jew, live like a Gentile, not like a Jew, how can you force the Gentiles to live like the Jews? In other words, you're imposing standards on them that you don't even impose on yourself. But it's worse than that. Because the real question Paul is asking is, why are you imposing those standards on them at all? Case study number two. Now, both case studies really are driving us to this central question. What Paul is really fighting for is the answer to this question. Are we really justified by faith in Christ alone? Or is there something else we have to do to make ourselves right with God? And that's not just a like right now question. That's a rest of your life question. Are we really made right with God simply on the basis of our faith in the finished work of Christ alone? Or is there something else we have to do to keep God off our back, to keep him happy with us, to keep him on our side, to make ourselves acceptable in his sight? That's the question. And some of you are like, well, look, the church is facing a lot of questions right now, Ryan, a lot. Declining church attendance nationwide, the rise of the nuns, the cultural confusion about issues like gender and sexuality and the rest. Like there are a lot of questions that the church is wrestling with right now. And yes, I would agree with you. I would also tell you that question that Paul asks here is still at the top of the list. It will always be at the top of the list. Because when it comes to the gospel, listen, we are adding machines. We add to the requirements of what it means to be a real Christian faster than you can say circumcision party. All right? Now, I need to give you some examples of this. This is probably where you stop writing at this point. Okay? But it's true. I think we all know it's true that it's not just in the United States, but all over the world. It's true that there are many Christians who feel superior because of their ethnicity or their race or their gender or their class and feel superior to other Christians. And by the way, we should just say that's certainly what's something in the background here. There is some ethnocentricity, ethnosuperiority going on here. This is not just a theological discussion. There's also a sense in which the Jewish Christians feel better than the Gentile Christians. It's also true that in our circles, we tend to define and divide between real Christians and the other people. So real Christians in our circles are disciplined in their spiritual disciplines. They read the Bible every day. They pray, not just at church and before meals, but they really pray. They're prayer warriors is what we like to say. And they share the gospel boldly with unbelievers and they serve sacrificially and they give at least 10%, but usually more. And then there's everybody else. And you see, when you begin to make those distinctions and you begin to see other Christians in that light, what you've done is you've just subtly begun to add what it means to be a first-class citizen in the kingdom of God. It gets better, all right? So in our circles, what we also do is we also tend to rank the sins which are acceptable and those which are not. So we have the acceptable sins in our culture, which would be, I would put on that list, greed, gossip, slander, malice, hatred. And then those which will get you disqualified quicker than you can blink. Like divorce and adultery and crimes that land you in prison and homosexual sexual sins. And you see what we've done, when we've said, real Christians don't struggle with those things. What we've really said is there are some who are doing what needs to be done and avoiding what needs to be avoided and those who are not. And the plot thickens because in our circles, especially in the last few years, we tend to say real Christians are the ones who think a certain way about a particular topic. And preferably, on social media, tell people about it. It's amazing to me, just imagine for me, just imagine me for a second. And yep, I'm gonna step on your toes here. But imagine for me for a second, 10 years ago, if someone had said to you, your Christian faith, like the validity of your Christian faith, the authenticity of your Christian faith, your commitment to Jesus, will be judged by your view of public health policy, particularly as it's related to face coverings and vaccines. That's what people are gonna look at and say, you're a real Christian and you're not. We'd be like, there's no, what world are you living in? Well, apparently this world. And we say, real Christians vote this way, we think this way on this particular topic. You see what we've subtly done? We've taken something which is important, and we've said, yeah, but this is really, that needs to go in the essential column. Now look, some of you are already cracking your knuckles, you're already stretching out your thumbs, you're getting ready for the email, and I could, and send it, like send it, I'm happy. Happy to read it, I got nothing else to do. Send me the email. But this is not meant to be snarky, but it's gonna go something like this. Brian, I appreciate what you said, I love Galatians, it's really important, I believe, yes, that the finished work of Christ alone is necessary for our salvation, but you've really made light of some things that are really important. And we're in an era where we need to stand for, see, I can almost write it for you. In fact, what I'll do is I will write it for you, I'll send it to you, if you like it, you send it back to me. All right. Please, please, as one of my professors loved to say, please do not hear what I'm not saying, okay? I am not saying those things are unimportant. I'm not saying that spiritual disciplines are to be dispensed with. I'm not saying that sin is not to be wrestled with and fought against. If you want another big word, mortified. I'm not saying that politics is unimportant, or that we shouldn't have deep convictions about things that are going on in our culture. I'm not saying that, what I am saying is that if you add anything to the gospel, you're not getting a better gospel. You're not getting a more motivated gospel. You're not getting a pure gospel. Paul says, you get no gospel, none. The Judaizers were not after bad things, but Paul says, they were after my freedom in Christ. See, that's what's at stake. Freedom. And what Paul wants to do with the doctrine of justification is take a key and put it in the shackles of self-righteousness and say, you don't have, this is good news for everybody, you don't have to be the morality police anymore. It's okay. You just don't need to tell everybody what it means to get in line and to be in line. You don't have to be on the self-justification brigade anymore. You are free. You don't have to prove anything. You don't have to do anything more. You don't have to show everybody how spiritual you are. You don't even have to prove yourself to God anymore because there's nothing you can do to make God love you any more or any less. Why? Because his opinion of you is fixed because his opinion of you is based on what Christ has done and it always will be. That's freeing. When my kids were small, I just want to emphasize when they were small, this doesn't happen anymore. It happens every once in a while, but not that much anymore. When they would run, they would love to watch themselves run. Have you seen a little kid do this? They're like, look how fast I am and they're running and looking at their legs at the same time. And I'd have to have this conversation and be like, hey, buddy, hey, buddy, hey, buddy, hey, buddy, hey, buddy, hey, buddy. You're not gonna win any races that way and you're probably gonna run into a tree that way. Again, all right? So here's how you run. You don't watch yourself run. You just lift your head up and you take a deep breath and you just run. You run. And I'll watch you run. So, oh yeah, chariots of fire. I fibbed a little bit. I love the scene with Harold Abrahams and it is the one I think about the most. But I made the mistake of going back during sermon prep and watching clips from chariots of fire. So I wrapped up the sermon at like midnight last night because they're so good. And the one that came back and the one that just still moves me to tears is the scene at the end with Eric Little, right? So the runner who never should have been in the 400 meter but ends up in the 400 meter and his final race, really the final race of his life as I understand it. And he's running around the home stretch and as he's running around the home stretch, you hear the voiceover of a letter that he wrote to his sister. And the voiceover goes like this. He says, Jenny, I believe that God made me for a purpose but he also made me fast. And when I run, I feel his pleasure. And that's what Paul is calling us to do in this passage. That's what he wants us to imbibe in deeply, the freedom of running in the pleasure of God. Our Father, we thank you for this liberating gospel. We pray that you would press it deep into our hearts by the power of your spirit. We pray, Lord, most of all that in doing so we would desire to please you with our lives and to give you glory by using the freedom you have given us to serve you, to love you all of our days. We ask it in Jesus' name, amen.
