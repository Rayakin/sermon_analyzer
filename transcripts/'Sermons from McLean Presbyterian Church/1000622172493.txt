Well, good morning once again. It is good to see all of you. This time of year, we don't always see each other every week. We're here and there and everywhere. And some of you have been on vacation. Some of you have told me where you've gone on vacation. Thanks for sharing that with me, the amazing places that you've been. I always like to see those pictures. I really do. I know I'm signing up for a few more after the service. That's great. That's fine. My favorite stories are the stories you guys tell me of going out into the wilderness and coming back. I feel like I'm talking to people who've been on a great adventure. I had one person come up and tell me or share with me that he'd gone into the Alaskan frontier to do backpacking with his kids. I'm like, that's pretty cool. Another person who went canoeing north of the boundary waters and tales of epic portages, which I think you just do those trips. So you can use the word portage in a sentence, such a cool word. I feel like you're reading Lewis and Clark's diary when you see, when you hear the word portage or someone else who went whitewater rafting on the Colorado river. I mean, these are like amazing, beautiful, life giving places. And when you think of, when you hear the word wilderness, that's, that's often what you think about. You think about the kind of place you want to spend two weeks on your summer vacation. But when you read Psalm 63 and you see the word wilderness, the wilderness of Judah, don't think about that. All right. Because the wilderness of Judah is not the kind of place you want to spend two weeks on your summer vacation. It's dry, rugged, brutal on the body. In fact, David's description shows up in the very first verse when he says, it is a dry and weary land where there is no water. Now that's not extraordinary in and of itself. What's fascinating about this Psalm and what he does with this description of his environment is that he then uses it as a metaphor for how he feels. So that language, dry and weary land where there is no water, is not just describing what he sees, it's describing how he feels when it comes to his relationship with God. And so this Psalm is a report from the wilderness, which I suspect even if you stayed here all summer, this wilderness, the wilderness that's being spoken of here, a spiritual wilderness is not unfamiliar territory. To us, we know what it's like to be here. And Psalm 63 is given to us as a word of life and encouragement in that place. As we open God's word together, let me pray and ask God to help us. Lord, we do ask for help that you would open our hearts to the truth of your word, that our lives would be supple in your hand, that you might shape and make and remake us even today as we meet together with you. We pray in Jesus' name, amen. Did you hear the apparent contradiction in that very first verse? All right, let's listen to it again. David begins with a confession of faith. Oh, God, you are my God. What a beautiful, personal, deliberate confession of David's faith in God. God, I believe in you. You know me. I know you. And then right after that, this. Earnestly, I seek you. My soul thirsts, my flesh faints, as in a dry and weary land where there is no water. Do you feel the tension here as David's saying, God, I believe in you. I don't feel you right now. Lord, I know you. You, you know me. You, you know me and yet you feel so far. I, I long for you. I, I have found you and yet I can't find you. And yet this is no contradiction. This is just the description. This is just putting towards what many of us feel at times in our lives. Even those of us who have been Christians for a very long time, we can find ourselves in this place of believing in God, but not feeling his presence with us. I don't need a show of hands, but I, I'm going to ask you a question. Have you, have you felt that before? Have you been there before? I've been there. David's, King David's been there. And my strong suspicion is, is many of you right now find yourself there. And so what do you do? David's answer to that question, what do you do is, is, is rather straightforward, but might sound counterintuitive to us. His answer is when you find yourself in that place of believing in God, but not feeling him, the answer is to worship. It is to worship him. Now, I realized that, um, telling someone who feels spiritually checked out or spiritually dry to worship God is sort of like telling a depressed person, why don't you just smile more, uh, or an anxious person, why don't you just relax a little bit, or maybe a little closer to home. Someone who can't dance, just find the beat in the music. Like it ain't going to happen. You know, we don't necessarily want to be in this place or seek to find our place in the wilderness. And yet here we are. And so the answer worship just seems simultaneously obvious and tremendously unhelpful until you begin to understand why David gives us this answer. And that, and that's the, that's the, that's the, that's the, that's the, that's the why David gives us this answer. And that, and that also is right there in verse one, when he says, my soul thirsts for you, my flesh faints for you. It's, um, when was the last time you talked to anybody like that? You know, maybe some heartfelt love letters full of bad poetry, maybe that was the last time you talked to somebody and longed for somebody like that. But this is the way that David speaks of God. And, and, and so what David is doing from the outset and what we need to do in under, in order to understand what in the world he's talking about, we need to understand what to understand what in the world he's talking about is David gives us this clear diagnosis of what's wrong with him. Remember, he's in the wilderness. He has lots of legitimate needs in this moment, food, drink, shelter, companionship. And yet the need, the longing that rises to the top, the one he says is ultimately what I crave the most is his longing for God. And you see, this is where often we get off track. We misdiagnosed the problem. We think, well, all I really need to do is to get this or to have this or to get this into my life. And then that, that longing, that yearning that just never seems to go away will finally go away. But David is saying, actually, what you are longing for fundamentally is God himself. And so the only answer to that longing is to worship the one we were made for. So what I want to do for a few minutes is just answer the question. How are you supposed to do that when you believe in God, but you don't feel him? Are you just supposed to fake it till you make it? Or is David calling us to something deeply authentic and true? I want to give us two ways to think about this psalm. There is, just even as it was being read again, there's so much, so much here we could just camp out on. But I just want to give us two ways of wrestling with this question of how it is we worship when we believe in God, but we don't feel him. Show up, first thing, show up and hold on. Show up, hold on. It might seem like a funny thing for David to say, given how far he is from Jerusalem. But the message he sends us through this psalm is that worship begins with showing up, and even showing up in church. I know we live in a culture, and even in a Christian culture, in which gathering together in corporate worship is often downplayed as a secondary thing, but David doesn't see it that way at all. Even though he's far away from the temple, look at where his mind goes in verse two. So I have looked upon you, God, in the sanctuary. He's talking about being in the temple and singing praises with God's people, and praying with God's people, and watching the sacrifices offered for God's people. And he says, in that moment of corporate worship as the community of faith, I have beheld your power and glory. He seems to be thinking of a very specific moment in the past. And from that specific encounter with the living God, he is drawing hope and confidence that if he just keeps showing up, God will make good on his promise. Have you ever had that kind of experience in church, in what we would call maybe a worship service, a time like this? I think I've shared this with you before, but I've forgotten by now, so I'll share it with you again. Fifteen, twenty years ago, when I was in seminary. Seminary, just so you know, at times can be a dry and weary land where there is no water. Not always, but it can be a difficult time in lots of different ways. And I was going through a difficult season in which the wonderful things I was learning in class were just not penetrating my heart in any meaningful way. I believed in God. I was struggling to feel him. I was struggling to get a hold on a felt sense of these things. So I felt like I was right where David was. And I walked into church, as I did on almost every Sunday morning. And I sat down, and it was, I will just tell you, it was a very Presbyterian service. Low key, not flashy, I guess that goes without saying. And it was, the pews weren't comfortable. I don't remember what the sermon was about. I don't remember what texts were read. I do remember we were receiving the Lord's Supper that day. And all I know is in the midst of that ordinary, unremarkable means of grace, the Lord broke through. I don't really know how to describe it without speaking rather charismatically with you, and that would make you nervous. So I will just say, where there was no joy, there was all of a sudden like a flicker of joy. Like where things meant, I just couldn't quite get to the reality. Everything felt very real. The veil seemed very thin in that moment. Now, I'm not giving myself credit for showing up. I'm just trying to give you a picture of what David is talking about in the midst of worship. God promises to minister to us by His Holy Spirit. Sometimes we don't know that that's what's happening, but the Lord promises. He makes a weekly appointment with you every Lord's Day to meet with you by His Spirit, to speak to you through His Word, to feed you from the table, to encourage you through the fellowship of the saints. And what He asks of you is that you show up. For some of you, showing up takes every ounce of strength you have right now. I get that. Some of you have incredibly attractive and compelling activities that in many ways you'd rather be doing. And that the world would say, you should be doing instead. And yet here you are, applying the sermon before you even heard it. You showed up. And let me just say to you, for those of you who are really, and people around you may not know this, but for those of you right now who are barely holding on, it is good that you showed up. It is good that you showed up. Now, showing up is not like this silver bullet that fixes everything. I don't want to pretend it's something it's not. David finishes his psalm, and he looks up, and he's still in the wilderness and a long way from Jerusalem. But that moment, that moment of encountering the living God in worship, drives him to worship in the presence. It gives him confidence that God means what he says when he says, I will be your God, and I will meet with you and gather you and commune with you. And it also moves him outside of that moment into the present day, because David doesn't just worship on the Lord's day. He doesn't just worship in the temple as if that's the only time that God ministers to us. No, David worships all the time. I certainly wouldn't want you to get the impression that the way God works in your life is, he just takes attendance at church. And once you, you know, sort of like a punch card, like once you get to 10 Sundays in a row, you get a free sandwich or something like that. That's not it at all. This corporate expression is meant to be lived out throughout the week. And so the example that David gives us is worshiping in the middle of the night. So he tells us in verse six, when I remember you upon my bed and meditate on you in the watches of the night. What a crazy example, like of all the things that he would say in this moment. What comes to mind is that actually in the middle of the night, when I wake up and I can't go back to sleep in that moment, I meditate. That word is not just to think about like a fleeting thought, but to chew on, to ponder, to consider the word of God and the character of God as he is revealed in his word. And the specific aspect of God's care that resonates with him so deeply in that moment, verse seven, is that he resides in the shadow of his wings. And because he does, he sings for joy. Now let's just work with that image for a second. It shows up other places in the Bible. Now let's just work with that image for a second. It shows up other places in the Bible as well. But the image here is the image of a mother bird. And she protects her young ones with her wings. She protects her young ones from the elements or from predators, from danger. And they rest secure in the shadow of her wings. And so here you have David in the wilderness, in the pitch black darkness, awake in the middle of the night. And the way he interprets that moment, it's like he says, this darkness, which might drive me to anxiety and despair, instead drives me deeper into the heart of God. And I realize that my God is my protection. He is my shade. He is my guard. He is my defender. And I can rest in him. I don't know about you, but this is deeply convicting for me because, well, what do you think about in the middle of the night? Some of you may not be old enough to enjoy this little facet of the human experience, but as you get older, you start waking up in the middle of the night and looking at the ceiling and you've got a choice. What am I going to think about right now? What I, I don't want to know all the answers, what I, I don't want to know all the stuff you think about in the middle of the night. You can tell me later, but one of the things I think about in the middle of the night is the fact that I'm awake in the middle of the night. You're done this, you check the clock. You're like, man, I hope it's like close to when I'm waking up. It's not, I'm waking up in three hours. And so now what you're thinking about is I have to wake up in three hours or worse. David, in that moment, his heart, so longing to show up in worship, meditates on the steadfast love of the Lord. What'd that look like for you? To resolve, to say, all right, the next time I'm waking up, I'm not just going to think about the fact that I'm waking up. I'm going to take that moment to reflect on something I read earlier in scripture. Maybe you go to bed reading a Psalm so that when you wake up, that Psalm is still fresh on your mind. You can meditate on it as a way of showing up in worship, even when you don't exactly feel like it, which is the definition of waking up in the middle of the night. You don't feel like doing anything except going back to sleep. But the Lord is giving us in this passage, the encouragement to show up. He also gives us the encouragement to hold on. In verse eight, David continues, my soul clings to you. The word cling there, that verb is the same word we find in Genesis chapter two, when the husband and wife, Adam and Eve are commanded to cling to each other or to cleave to each other in love and loyalty in the context of the covenant of marriage. That same language is being used here. David speaking of his desire to cling to the Lord. Some of you get a picture of this whenever we do a baptism, especially when it's a slightly older child who can see what's coming. And the child comes over and I'm just speaking from experience. And the pastor, the parents come over and I can see it from where I'm sitting, the superhuman kung fu white knuckle grip of the child on mom or dad. It's just like, yeah, this isn't going to work. You know, and gently the pastor tries to take the child. It's like the child slowly goes parallel to the ground. You know, it's like, all right, we're giving up on that. That's the image that David has here. It is to cling to God in love and in loyalty, to cling to him. And yet with that, he adds this in verse 8, your right hand upholds me. Yes, we are to hold on to God, even when it feels like he's not present with us. But we do so with the confidence of knowing that he is holding on to us. Now, if that's going to happen, if we are going to hold on to God like that, it means we're going to have to let go of some things. Because you can't hold on to God with that sort of clinging, cleaving if your hands are full with other things. So you have to let go of some things in order to hold on to him. We see that happening in David's life. Verses 9 through 11 may seem kind of abrupt to you, but just remember what David's situation is. There really are people chasing after him. He's not on a two-week vacation in the wilderness of Judah. He's being chased there by people who are seeking, as he says in verse 9, to destroy his life. It could be King Saul. It could be Absalom. We don't know where we are in the David story. Unfortunately for David, there are a few options, because there were a few times in his life when he was a fugitive. This is one of those times. And so in the middle of the night, as he's meditating on the Lord, his mind also goes to those who are seeking his life. And this is one of the places I think our minds go when our minds are free. Often we have, I don't know about you, sometimes I do this, you have imaginary conversations with people, people who have wronged you, people you need to work through. You start having those imaginary conversations. Oh, that's what I'm going to say to that person. That's what I should have said to that person. That's what I would do to that person. That's what I'm going to do to that person, right? We begin to fantasize on how that's going to go down to make us look awesome. That might sound like what David is doing, but it's not. Actually, when you read, he says, yes, there are those seeking to destroy my life, but they shall go down to the depths of the earth. They shall be the portion for jackals. They shall be given over to the portion of the sword, the power of the sword. Their mouths will be stopped. You see, he's confessing his trust that God is the one who will do what is right. Like, I wonder if echoing in his mind is the question of Abraham from Genesis 18. Will not the judge of all the earth do what is right? You see, in order to cling to God, he's having to let go of stuff. He's having to let go of bitterness and getting even and being right and defending himself and justifying himself and making sure his reputation is sterling. He's going to have to trust that the God who does all things well will come through for him. One day, and I'll just say this gently to some of you, because this may be where you are. There are some of you who find yourself feeling distant from God precisely for this reason. Because rather than holding onto him in faith and trust, you are holding onto bitterness. And you're refusing to forgive. And when you meditate, you meditate on anger. And this psalm calls us to let go in order to hold onto the one who is our defender and our shield. We show up. We hold on. In those conversations I was having with my friends who have been on all these amazing wilderness adventures this summer, whether it was on the Colorado River or the Boundary Waters or Alaska or anywhere else, all of them have this in common. As adventurous as they are, all of them hired guides, every single one of them. Like, that's amazing. Well, we had a guide. What that means is we were smart enough to find somebody who had been there before, you know, who didn't show up and were like, I hope YouTube showed me how to steer this raft. Like, people who would say, yeah, I've done this. I've got you. I know where to go. And the same is true when we find ourselves in seasons of spiritual wilderness. We need a guide. David is a guide. But even more so, Jesus is a guide. The Gospels tell us that Jesus was driven into the same wilderness, literally, where he was tempted. But the wilderness I have in mind right now is the wilderness of the wilderness of the cross. You know, there too, Jesus asked a question that at first seems contradictory. He cried out, my God, my God, confession, why have you forsaken me? Perceived absence. And yet this was no sort of figment of his imagination. We know that on the cross, Jesus endured the penalty for our sin, that he was forsaken, that we might be forgiven. But also that we might know that this place of spiritual wilderness is not unfamiliar to him. He knows it. And he is with us in it. And his resurrection reminds us that a day is coming when we will hunger and thirst no more. Revelation 7 puts it this way. Jesus has promised a day is coming when we will hunger no more, neither will we thirst. For on that day, our shepherd will guide us to springs of living water. And God himself will wipe away every tear. Amen. Our God and our Father, we thank you that you have given us this psalm. Which articulates so much of how we experience life, helps us diagnose the wrongheaded ways that we try to fix the problem, and ultimately points us to the only one we can cling to and find hope and joy. Father, help my friends here to show up. Help us all to hold on. Because of the living hope we have in Christ, who has lived, died, risen again, and is returning to set all things right and make all things new. And we pray this in his name. Amen.
