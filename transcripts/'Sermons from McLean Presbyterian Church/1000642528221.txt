Good morning, everybody. Good to see you here this morning. My name is Ryan Laughlin. I'm the senior pastor here. It's my joy to open God's Word with you. We're also being joined by our friends in Herndon. Hello to you folks as well. Let me pray for us as we open God's Word together. Our Father, we pray that you would help us to not just understand your Word, but to grapple with it, to wrestle with it, that we might hear from you today from this portion of your Holy Word. We ask it in Jesus name. Amen. Well, you might not remember the summer of 2020. You may not want to remember the summer of 2020. Let me refresh your memory. All those years ago, we were arguing about a lot of things and we were doing it mostly social distance from each other with masks or online. As a world, as a nation, we were wrestling with a lot of questions about a lot of things. So you can be forgiven if you didn't notice this tweet went out. By the way, this is when Twitter was a thing. Okay, this is before it changed. But this is from summer of 2020. If biological sex isn't real, there's no same-sex attraction. If sex isn't real, the lived reality of women globally is erased. I know and love trans people, but erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives. It isn't hate to speak the truth. The person who composed that tweet, JK Rowling, the beloved author, at least up until that point, the beloved author, famous author of the Harry Potter stories, which I'm sure many of you have enjoyed, including the movies that followed. But the backlash from that tweet was something she never expected. Many of her fans distanced themselves immediately from the Many of her fans distanced themselves immediately from her. Many of them removed tattoos from their bodies, which depicted various Harry Potter characters. Many of the actors from the films also distanced themselves from her and from that statement. Photos were removed from websites. There were even book burnings of Harry Potter books. Why? It's Harry Potter. It's JK Rowling. Why? Now, it's worth observing that she wasn't speaking as a conservative Christian. I don't know where she stands on that. She wasn't speaking as a political or cultural conservative. She wasn't speaking as an ardent supporter of traditional family values. She was speaking as a secular feminist. And the point of sending out this controversial tweet was to suggest that the modern secular story as it pertains to gender is not good for women. It's not good for women's rights. And the reason I start there is because when we talk about gender in our society, we immediately put ourselves into the two categories that are often used and pitted against one another, conservatives on one side, progressives on the other. But here you have somebody who I don't think would necessarily identify as either one of those, recognizing there's something wrong with the story. It's not good. To erase gender doesn't bring flourishing, at least for a certain group of people. It doesn't bring the best. And so what she's calling for is a true and better story as it pertains to all of life. And as we've been looking at in this series, and we'll continue to look at in this series, specific experiences in life, including the experience of gender. Now, even if you don't know the story of JK Rowling and all the all the backlash of that situation, all of us experience at some experience at some level the confusion that's going on in our cultural conversation regarding gender. So some of you work for companies or organizations or for the military and you find yourself in the situation in which it's becoming increasingly difficult to follow authority and to follow Jesus as it pertains to policies and procedures related to gender. Others of you are teachers in schools. You want to love your kids well. You want the best for them and you're finding yourself in that same difficult spot. Some of you are grandparents, parents, aunts, uncles. You have young people in your life who are having conversations about their gender identity. You never had when you were a kid. And it's confusing and you don't know what to say. You don't know what to do. And then there are others of us for whom gender identity is a real struggle. And maybe that struggle is a struggle. You've kept to yourself. Maybe you've shared it. Maybe it hasn't gone. Well when you've shared it and you feel stuck. And and then there there are a lot of us who when we hear a quote like that when we consider everything we see going on in our culture, not just the confusion but the anger and the hurt and the hatred we just want to say something meaningful to people. We don't want to be jerks about it. But we also have convictions about what the Bible says and what's true. And so we're just trying to figure out how to navigate a conversation which is not marked by truth and love in most of the context we're engaged in but that we know ought to be marked by both truth and love. And we're sort of at a loss as to how to do that. And then there are others of you who just completely disagree with everything I'm about to say for the next few minutes and you're wondering why are you talking about this at church? Of all places like what qualifies you as a pastor to get up and talk about someone's life? Why do you care? Just let people do what they want to do. Now wherever you find yourself this this morning, I hope you find this morning. I hope you can appreciate I can't address all of those concerns in one sermon or five or 11. I just can't and as I've said before this probably isn't even the best forum to have those kind of conversations, you know, just like the one-way format that we're in right now and that you're stuck in for the next few minutes together. Like there needs to be some give-and-take. These are conversations that require a great deal of wisdom. It's just not it's not it's not clear what every situation demands what love demands in every situation. So for that reason, I will just mention to you again and if you're here at MPC, Austin mentioned a moment ago the bridge the gap conversation for our parents. That's next Sunday at 9 o'clock. I think it's next Sunday at 9 o'clock go on the website. Make sure I'm right about that. I would highly encourage you to go. We're also going to have a pastor's Q&A. This is a little ways from now, but March 3rd when we're done with the series after the evening service, so you can bring your questions about this or anything else. We're talking about to that our adult Christian education in the next hour is going to have a panel to explore this issue in more depth with many of our folks who know quite a bit about this and have experience with it. I'd encourage you to go to that and also I'll just tell you many of you email us me Austin Terrence bill others specific questions that you're wrestling with and you are always welcome to do that and we'll do our best to answer those in a meaningful way or meet with you. So I'm not going to answer all of your questions. What I want to do this morning instead is set up a framework a biblical framework so that we can begin to walk through these things together and ultimately my goal is for us to understand what the Bible says about gender and to be able to respond in a way that that is equally concerned with truth and and love and I think a framework will help us to do that. So what I want to do this morning is talk about four things God's design and our distortions and God's redemption and our response. So God's design our distortions God's redemption our response God's design as we've been saying for here in Genesis chapter 1 and 2 and we mentioned this last week. I'll pick it up again right now just to say Genesis 1 is a joyful passage and one of the reasons it's joyful is because over and over again, we're told God saw what he made and it was good and in our passage today verse 31 we read God saw everything he had made and behold it was very good. So if someone tells you that a restaurant is very good or a movie is very good or a TV series is very good and you just have to you have to watch it. You have to go there. It is a logical question to ask what makes it good. Why do you think it's good and you should get some answer to that. Well in the same way in this passage when Genesis 1 tells us that God's design is good. You have every right to ask why what makes it good. So I want to answer that question God about God's good design just with a sentence that will break down in parts. God's design for gender is good because God created us in his image for his glory. God created us that language is also here in Genesis 1 and 2 we read in Genesis 1 26 let us make man and he proceeded to make man and woman and in verse 27 God created man in his image male and female he created them later on in chapter 2 we get a closer look like a camera zoom in on the creation of Adam where God we're told in verse 7 of chapter 2 God formed the man the language there is really the language of a potter forming clay and then later in that same chapter in chapter 2 verse 22 that he made Eve from Adam and that language is the language of building. It's the language it's used later in the Bible to describe building an altar or building a building and the reason I point those verbs out to you is they give us little visual pictures that God is the one who made us as physical creatures that's that's under the banner of very good that's under the banner of very good that we are inherently as human beings embodied physical creatures and it's very clear in Genesis 1 that that includes the difference between male and female in other words our biological sex physically speaking is part of God's benediction of very good one person has put it like this we are gendered all the way down every cell in a woman's body has an XX sex chromosome every cell in a man's body has an XY chromosome now there are very rare exceptions to that which we can talk about but by and large 99.99% of the human population has as its normative feature what Genesis 1 tells us that we are made male and female and that's very good God created us and he created us were told in his image we get that a few different times in Genesis 1 verse 26 let us make man in our image and then verse 27 just so you can see it again God created man in his own image in the image of God he created him male and female he created them by the way this is the reason why we recognize and celebrate the sanctity the sacredness of human life that's not a political rallying statement that is deeply embedded in what it means to embrace the Bible as Holy Scripture because it's right here in the first chapter that every human being no matter who you are no matter what you look like no matter what your background is you are made in the image of God and therefore you have inherent dignity and value and every human being has inherent dignity and value this idea is so important we're going to spend the next three weeks talking about it it has massive implications for how we live how we see ourselves and how we see other people but for now I want you to see that here in this passage we are reminded that God created us male and female in his image and finally for his glory when you read through Genesis 1 one of the things you notice is that there are complementary pairs there's day and night there's sky and land there's sun and moon and that culminates in male and female and these complementary pairs aren't like opposing forces they enhance one another one person has called them the beautiful difference that is inherent intrinsic to God's good creation I mean just think for a moment in creation when when when you see the day give way to night in a sunset how they enhance and beautify one another how when the night gives way to the day on a beautiful sunset how these things enhance the beauty of one another how when you're driving and looking at the mountains and see where the land meets the sky there's the stark beauty that informs one another and how much more Genesis 1 is telling us does male do male and female bring out beauty and goodness in one another in glory in one for the glory of God it's important to say this because again the modern secular story as it shows up in various ideologies would say that the only way to escape the oppression of the sex binary is to erase it and Genesis 1 is saying there's nothing to escape actually this is this is good this is very good case in point none of us would be here if it weren't for the sexual binary right if a male and a female somewhere in the past hadn't decided to be fruitful multiply we would not be here and not to be trite or or you know or flippant about that but in that very act of procreation we are getting a picture of what it means for the beautiful difference to create life not create death and destruction so this is God's good design right here in Genesis chapter 1 really right here in Genesis chapter 1 verses 26 and 27 you see it but of course this isn't always what we see in our own lives or in the life of the church or in the world around us why is that well because we've distorted God's good design and when I say we I mean all of us have because all of us are bruised and broken and affected by what happens in Genesis 3 the fall and in Genesis 3 Adam and Eve who were called by God and commissioned by God as his image bearers when they decide to turn their backs on him and just define for themselves what the good life is they plunge themselves all of creation and all of us into misery and everything gets distorted everything gets distorted our minds our bodies which is how we end up with the sorts of conditions I mentioned a moment ago the effects of the fall that are still seen today our relationships even our self-understanding all of it gets distorted this is why I say that this distortion happens to all of us you know here we are in the church opening the Bible and yet we have to recognize that the church has not always gotten this right just look at the church's history we see sadly plenty of examples in which Christians have distorted God's good design for gender in the way that Christians have often treated like traditional gender roles as biblical mandates even up until this this point the way that the church has looked the other way when their sexual discrimination and harassment and even abuse inside the church and as Christians we have to own up to the fact that we have not lived out what God has called us to live out and yet even in admitting that and being brokenhearted and grieved over the fact that that's that's on our watch we also recognize that these are distortions and so if you've been hurt by any of those kind of situations I'm sorry that you've been hurt you have every right to be angry but I hope you can see that Genesis 1 promotes a very different positive powerful vision for gender that that has not particularly been perhaps been your experience so we ought to talk a bit then about the distortions not just within Christian circles but also within the wider culture there's there's all kinds of things we could talk about here and we will over the next few weeks as we talk about other topics but the one I want to focus on is the distortion that you often hear as it's articulated in the transgender ideology let me just summarize this with a statement made by Sam Albury so he summarized the the difference between God's good design and the distortion in our modern secular world like this he says the culture says your psychology is your sexual identity let your body be conformed to it the Bible says your body is your sexual identity let your mind be conformed to it so the culture does your psychology is your sexual identity conform your body to it the Bible says no your body is your sexuality It's what we just talked about let your mind be conformed to it so this would be the experience of somebody that that cultural statement would try to account for the person perhaps in your life perhaps your own struggle in which your sense of identity doesn't match your biological sex now if you rewind the tape a bit to the 1990s mental health professionals would diagnose a statement like I feel like a man trapped in a woman's body if someone came and talked to them about that experience which is a real experience for people they would identify that as gender identity disorder is a recognized disorder it affected about 0.01% of the population mostly young males that was in the early 90s in 2013 the the literature changed the designation from gender identity disorder to gender dysphoria dysphoria is not really a word we use very much but you can think of the word euphoria and think of the opposite of that so euphoria feelings of elation and joy dysphoria feelings of anguish and distress now we could talk about why that changed happen that's not really what I want to talk about I just want to acknowledge that as this changed along with this change in the literature there also as you probably know just based on how much we're talking about it in our culture the number of people who reported and that they experienced this sort of dysphoria skyrocketed as well and there are reasons for that that we could talk about offline along with that and again you've probably heard this in the news as well it is well documented that at the same time the amount of people reporting depression and even suicidal tendencies skyrocketed and and sadly that affects not just young men who are struggling this way but even more and more young women who are struggling in this way now I say all that not to explain it all again this is a this is a larger discussion there's research as to why all of those things have gone on it's simply to say this that the place we start as Christians when we're engaged with people who are struggling in this way it's not condemnation but compassion I think about Matthew 9 a lot when Jesus saw the crowds and were told by Matthew that he had compassion on the crowds why because they were harassed and helpless like sheep without a shepherd and in in in reflecting on that passage I don't want you just to imagine Jesus looking at other people you need to imagine Jesus looking at you because we're all harassed and helpless like sheep without a shepherd without Jesus so we start with compassion as well as clarity to say what I've just reported to you what we've been thinking about is it's not God's good design for gender for others or for ourselves so the question becomes how does God redeem gender and what I really want to talk about for a few minutes is how Jesus speaks to this you'll sometimes hear people say maybe someone has said to you you know Jesus never talked about sex or gender so why should we well that's actually a false statement Jesus did he didn't talk about as much as you do but he didn't talk about it so there was one time this is in Matthew 19 Jesus is approached by religious leaders he they have like a technical question on divorce and the way Jesus answers that question is really telling he says remember he's saying this to like PhD theology students okay his question for them is have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female now it's obviously he's you know he's giving him a little bit of a needle there but he's also recognizing you know maybe you need to go back and read the primary documents and the primary document in this case is Genesis 1 he goes on he quotes Genesis 2 and therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife and the two shall become one flesh so they are no longer two but one right there Jesus is affirming God's good design for gender right there and yet it's not just what Jesus says that's important it's who Jesus is we just finished it wasn't that long ago we were celebrating Christmas and we sang lots of Christmas carols that talked about the baby boy Jesus the second person of the Trinity took on human flesh and not just any sort of human flesh he didn't just become any sort of person he became a boy who grew into a teenager who grew into a man son of Mary circumcised on the eighth day you have to be male to be circumcised a day last I checked brother to his brothers and sisters and a man crucified on the cross and that's not who he was in his embodied self it's who he is you know the hope that you and I have that we have an advocate that we have a mediator who sympathizes with our weaknesses is that Jesus is still embodied in his glorified body as one person has said the dust of earth sits on the throne of heaven this is why Paul says that Jesus is the firstborn of many brothers that Jesus is now our king and our elder brother and the testimony of Jesus for eternity will be God's good design for gender because he himself affirms it in his very body now that's not to downplay or diminish or devalue women in any way Paul actually accounts for this in Galatians chapter 3 when he says in Christ there is no male or female which some people understand is we'll see there you go we just erased all need for for biological sex and gender being being connected actually it's not what Paul's doing at all what he's saying is men and women made in the image of God in Christ are equal we have equal access equal rights equal privileges because we are together the children of God and the brothers and sisters of Christ that's who Jesus is and then consider what Jesus does Acts chapter 8 so the book of Acts and I'm skipping around a bit but the book of Acts is really the story of the early church and in it of course you're going to have many stories of conversion especially people converting out of a non-Jewish background and the one I want to draw your attention to is in Acts chapter 8 Philip one of Jesus's friends and Apostles at this point Jesus has ascended to heaven and sent the Holy Spirit so everything he's doing now he's doing through the church by the work of the Spirit and Philip meets a man from Ethiopia this man's actually doing a little Bible study in his chariot on Isaiah chapter 53 Philip helps him understand that's talking about Jesus they pass a body of water the man says why don't I just get baptized because now I believe in Jesus he gets baptized he goes on his way that man were told in Acts chapter 8 is a eunuch and a eunuch at this time in history was somebody who was castrated so medical procedurals medical procedure for purposes of the court that we don't need to get into all that as to why this is a fairly common occurrence in the ancient world and here you have somebody who even though it's not a one-for-one analogy to what it means to struggle with gender dysphoria it is somebody who's who's experiencing a disparity between their sense of gender and their bodies can we at least say that and yet when he turns to Jesus places his faith in Jesus as his Lord and Savior he is welcomed into God's kingdom the beauty of the gospel is that Jesus welcomes all of us in our sexual brokenness in our gender confusion in our disorder desires he welcomes us into his presence this is why Jesus says come to me all you who are weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest that's not just an invitation for people out there who really need it that's an invitation for all of us because all of us come into this place broken profoundly broken in all sorts of different ways but the hope of the gospel is that Jesus receives us as we are so how do we respond if that's God's good design how we distort it God's redemption how do we respond so if if you were to come to me and say you know I have have a conversation I need some help with or how do I respond to this situation the first question I'm going to ask you is who you're talking to because so many of our conversations as it relates to gender and some of the topics we've been talking about today it's sort of like a one-way conversation usually with a screen well maybe it's two ways if you're yelling at the screen maybe that would count but it's mostly a one-way conversation and it's mostly you know cable news show social media YouTube and it's just always always worth bearing in mind that the algorithms that give you that information on your phone and on your computer those are tailor-made to make you really angry you know that right like it is a medium of outrage so that's just worth bearing in mind but let's just say we want to interact with these ideas is there a place of course there's a place for that maybe not with outrage maybe in more productive ways in ways that are respectful that are clear and compassionate but need to be said let me just give you one example of that our denomination the Presbyterian Church in America just this weekend actually published a letter that's being sent to the White House and to Congress that that is that is petitioning the government to protect minors from gender reassignment surgery now you may not agree with that when I read it I happen to think it's really well reasoned well thought out respectful and I would just submit that to you as an example of a way to meaningfully connect what we believe with with what we hope is a way to protect those who are most vulnerable there's completely a place for that you can actually read that letter we posted it on the link to our to that letter on our website if you want to take a look at it later maybe would be good but that's one model of one kind of way of speaking but I would suggest you most of us are not losing sleep over those kind of conversations if you're losing sleep over these conversations it's because there are people you know and love who are struggling with this issue that's why and to me that's a different conversation and it's important to make the distinction not everyone who's struggling with this issue is the activist screaming in your face there are a lot of people in our lives who are hurting and who need our love and our compassion and an understanding of what's good according to God's design so let me just give you a couple thoughts on that so if this is someone you're speaking to or if I'm speaking to you let me just say this to you my argument this morning has been that Christianity offers you a better affirmation a better affirmation so much of what all of us long for is to be told that we're loved and valued and accepted all of us want that and there are all kinds of really unhealthy ways of looking for that but what I hope you see in the first few pages of the Bible is that the affirmation that's given to every single human being is the kind of affirmation you cannot find anywhere else there's no one else is going to give this to you to tell you that you are made in the image of God himself that you are outrageously valuable as you are outrageously valuable the Bible offers a better affirmation the Bible off also offers a better hope so the modern secular story especially as it relates to transgender issues would say that for someone struggling in this way and in real distress and I just we need to underline in real distress the only hope you have for peace and relief is transitioning the only hope you have and I would just respectively say to you first of all that's just objectively not true when more and more studies are showing that people who transition are not happier on the other side I'm not saying everybody I'm saying more and more studies are showing there are long-term health risks associated with it and there are long-term mental health risks associated with it and we ought to be able to tell the truth about that but also to say to you that there's a difference between seeking peace and relief by changing all the things on the outside as if that's going to fix what's on the inside and what the gospel offers I will tell you is a harder path in many ways but a truer path because the gospel says to you that when Jesus welcomes you into his presence when he says to you this morning come to me all you are who are weary and heavy laden he accepts you as you are but he does not leave you as you are he changes you from the inside out not transitioning but transforming you I don't want to suggest to you that that's instantaneous that all your disordered desires go away like that some of us will struggle with them for the rest of our lives can I just say that it will be the struggle of your life be the fight of your life listen to the way that Paul talks about this in 2nd 2nd Corinthians chapter 5 by the way writing to a church immersed in a hyper sexualized culture okay so he's he's not naive about the struggles of living in the kind of culture we're living in and he reminds us that in these bodies for all kinds of individual reasons some that we share with others and some that we don't there is there is groaning that's what it feels like to live to groan in the body to be heavy burdened by everything that's wrong on the inside but then he says here's the hope we don't lose heart because outwardly we may be wasting away but inwardly by the power of the Spirit we are being renewed day by day then he says this for this light and momentary affliction is preparing for us in eternal weight of glory can I just say to you that this is the better hope that all of us need no matter what our struggles might be that the hope Jesus offers is the hope of being transformed transformed from the inside out it's not easy it's not instantaneous but it is accompanied by the greatest hope of all that one day God will restore us completely body soul and mind our gracious father we pray that you would help us in our need to look to you in our pride to be humbled in our hard-heartedness to be open in our anger and our fear to choose love would help us to be your ambassadors in this world in this moment for your glory and for the good of our neighbor and we ask it all in Jesus name amen
