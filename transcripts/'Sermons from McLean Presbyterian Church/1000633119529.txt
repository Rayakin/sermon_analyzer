Good morning. My name is Austin Kettle and like some of the people baptized this morning, the Lord called me from a far part of the earth. This accent is British if we haven't met yet, but last Friday I became an American citizen so you don't have to fill in those security questionnaires anymore. Thank you so much. It's been a delight being part of this family through that process. The passage we're looking at that we'll read in a moment does look quite intimidating, and it is. It's dense, it changes directions, it goes all over the place. But before we get into it, I want you to see that really it's about motivation. As we read this, I want you to bear that in mind. Not like a motivational speech, it probably couldn't be much further from that, but about getting to what is beneath our motivation as we seek to live lives that follow Christ, the glory in him, that live as children of our Heavenly Father. About connecting our motivations to what's beneath them, our own understanding of our selfhood at a fundamental level. It kind of gets under the skin of why we behave the way we behave, and why we're so inconsistent. I was thinking about that whole relationship between motivation and self this week, and I kind of had this immediate transportation back ten years to grad school back in England, qualifying to become a high school teacher. And there I am, sat in the library of the Department of Education, spiral-bound theses all around me, smell of lacrosse gloves, unfortunately, at my feet, and the sound of Carly Rae Jepsen in my ears. Wonderful times. And I'm just instantly transported back to this paper by Desi and Ryan. I'm not going to make you think about it too much, but they dived into this whole tension between motivation and selfhood. Very quickly they said, hey, the categories we've got of intrinsic motivation, like rising up from within you, and extrinsic motivation, being pushed to do something from outside, they're kind of inadequate to explain how we really move things forward for ourselves and for other people. It's not so simple, you know, I was training as a teacher with a kid who you really want to learn. It's not so simple as I've got to make them want to learn. There are ways we can connect that sense of self outside of self and move one another forward. That's probably too much already from that. We can talk about it more later, but motivation, I want you to hear from that, it's a complex thing and what matters most isn't necessarily kind of where the motivation comes from, but that relation it has to our fundamental understanding of who we are. To know why you do things, you must know who you are, and perhaps even more importantly, you must know who you believe you are. You must know who you believe you are and start to see how that your heart acts and is acting out of this level below your motivations. What's going on up here can be traced back down there. We've come to this section of Galatians that speaks directly into this tension. The Galatians, they had welcomed the gospel, they had delighted in it, they had lived it, and then things had changed. Something's gone wrong and Paul decides it's not enough to go at the level of that surface motivation, but he needs to come in underneath and teach them who they are. It's not an angry lecture, it's not a slap on the wrist, it's the words of a loving parent. This is kind of as personal as Paul gets in this letter. He's appealing using his language of motherhood you're going to see in just a second. Tender, loving, deeply concerned, pulling a confused wayward child back and saying, come back, come close, then come on, let's go. Let's pray and then read this passage. Heavenly Father, by your Spirit and by your Word would you form Christ in us. Holy Spirit testify to our hearts that we are yours in our deepest self and Lord Jesus give us such wonder and awe at your person and your gospel that we might see you and your world and ourselves as we truly are. Amen. Let's read this passage. Galatians chapter 4 from verses 12 to 31. It's on page 974 of the pew Bibles. Brothers, I entreat you, become as I am for I also have become as you are. You did me no harm. You know it was because of a bodily ailment that I preached the gospel to you at first and though my condition was a trial to you, you did not scorn or despise me but treated me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus. What then has become of your blessedness? For I testify to you that you would have gouged out your eyes and given them to me. Have I then become your enemy by telling you the truth? They make much of you but for no good purpose. They want to shut you out that you may make much of them. It's always good to be made much of for a good purpose and not only when I'm present with you, my little children, for whom I'm again in the anguish of childbirth until Christ is formed in you. I wish I could be present with you now and change my tone for I'm perplexed about you. Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you listen to the law? For it's written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman and one by a free woman, but that the son of the slave was born according to the flesh while a son of the free woman was born through promise. Now this may be interpreted allegorically. These women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai bearing children for slavery. She is Hagar. Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia. She corresponds to the present Jerusalem for she is in slavery with her children. But the Jerusalem above is free. She is our mother. For it is written, Rejoice, O barren one who does not bear. Break forth and cry aloud, you who are not in labor. For the children of the desolate one will be more than those of the one who has a husband. Now you brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise. But just as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now. But what does the scripture say? Cast out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with the son of the free woman. So brothers, we are not children of the slave, but of the free woman. This is the word of the Lord. We're going to think about three moves that Paul makes in this passage. Almost as much as we're going to learn from exactly what he says, we're going to learn from the particular moves he makes pastorally with the Galatians here. And to address the the brokenness in their motivations, he does those three things I mentioned before. He says, come back, come close, and come on. That's the three things we're going to think about. So first, come back. I'm looking at verses 12 to 17 here. As he says, refuse to be flattered out of your freedom. You get that? Refuse to be flattered out of your freedom. He's saying come back. He reminds them of how they loved him and lived as though the gospel was true when he was with them. So true that this image is kind of ridiculous. It's a crazy image. King Lear type stuff. You would have gouged out your eyes. You see the passion there? That absolute belief and conviction that this is true and nothing else matters. That's where they were. But Paul's gone now and the inevitable has happened. Bad company corrupts good character. Look at verse 17. These false teachers we've heard so much about are so obvious to Paul. They make much of you but for no good purpose. Here's their motivation. They want to shut you out that you may make much of them. They're manipulating the Galatians. They're flattering them into slavery. Flattering them that they can do so much so they can shut the Galatians out of gospel freedom and use the Galatians to make much of themselves. It's a tragically common pattern in spiritual leadership. It'd be sad if we'd seen it once in Galatians but we see it far too often. You tell people, you flatter them indirectly, you say you're not good enough but you could be. You're not there yet but you could be. You're not true Christians but you could be. If they follow you, if you follow me, if you listen to me, if you do the the unique things that I am telling you that they're not telling you, we can do unprecedented things. And a pattern makes this key move. It shifts the focus off Christ and onto us. We think it's shifting it onto us ourselves and it feels great but it's not even going on to us. It's going on to that manipulative leader. You see how dangerous this is? That you can be flattered out of your freedom. All I could be, yes leader give it to me. I'll do it and you're led away from Christ. These teachers so close to the truth make themselves lightning rods for glory and we gaze as they light up the sky and claim to be producing the lightning. Come back. Paul says it to the Galatians, come back. We hear it today. Have I then become your enemy by telling you the truth? Because I'm still telling you this gospel. It's not as exciting. You cannot cause the lightning. The blaze of glory belongs to God and if you try to claim it, it will burn you up. It will burn us up. Don't try to take it, come back. The danger is real. We know that we can get flattered out of our freedom right? It happens in the world the whole time. The job interview you go to and they offer you everything your current position doesn't have and so you don't check Glassdoor. There's a website about like hey tell me how your employer is and six months in you realize you've lost so much that was good about where you were. Or the relationship where you start dating and he's telling you oh you're amazing, you're incredible, I've never met anyone like you and putting you on a pedestal and praising you and it's wonderful until the moment when you need grace and it's withheld. We can be flattered out of our freedom. It's miserable. Perhaps even more insidiously we can start to believe our own hype when we're taught this way, when we listen to these voices. We can start to believe that the work that the Holy Spirit has done in us, among us, was something that we did. That I became more patient. That we became more generous. That these things that the Lord has done came from us. We start to believe our own hype and just think what I can do with that. If I can control that. If I can just isolate that and use that. That's me. I can do that. Flattered out of your freedom. Cutting yourself off from the very power that has worked that beautiful stuff. You see the subtlety. If you're falling for it right now I just ask you come back. Come back. Come back to Christ. He never leaves or forsakes you. You see where Christ says come to me all you who are weary and I will give you rest. This false teaching says come to me and I will make you the best. I'll make you awesome. And the freedom of the gospel says you don't have to be. Come. Rest. You're a child. You're delighted in. You're loved. The Holy Spirit is real. He's at work in you. It's okay. If you believe the lie and try to take back control you lose it all. We're just saying your life is filled with graces undeserved. That's wonderful. Come and enjoy that. Come back to Jesus if you're straying. If you've moved far from him come back. Refuse to be flattered out of your freedom. If you've come back come close. Come close. Come close to those who want to see Christ formed in you. You see how Paul's saying to the Galatians I long to be with you. Have I become your enemy? You loved me. There was mutuality in their relationship. There was closeness and when they were close with someone who was proclaiming Christ to them there was health. There was the gospel. Come close. You're still the child of God. You know verse 18 is such a lovely gift. You see that it's always good to be made much or for a good purpose. Let me tell you you're not an awful Gorgon for wanting people to make much of you. You're hard way up. God made you that way to be delighted in. To be celebrated for the gifts that he put in you that are beautiful and glorify him. You're not dreadful for enjoying that experience. Remember who's writing. Paul has spent time with the Galatians. They've cared for him and he's cared for them. Remember the language of the physical ailment. The condition that was a trial to them. There's mutuality as we come to Christ together. He's not above them. They're coming close to one another and in that gospel community it's not coming out of a general conviction or kind of intellectual passion. It's coming out of this desire to be in Christ together and he longs for three particular things. I don't want you to miss them in those verses. He longs for them to be made much of. To celebrate one another in Christ. To recognize the things that the Lord is doing among us. He longs to be present with them. He, Paul, knows that it's good it's good to write. He's writing scriptures to them right? This is incredibly powerful. He is the one teaching us about the power of the Spirit through the Word of God and still Paul longs to be in the room with them. I wish I could be present with you so I could change my tone. You're doing something right being here this morning. He longs to be present with them because he knows face-to-face is better. What he longs for though isn't this. It's not to be at the pulpit looking out but to be with you. To be close enough to have this kind of conversation with you. Not just generally. So come close. Don't put it off. Get into gospel community. You weren't designed to slip in and out of church alone. You weren't designed to read the Bible alone and to know God alone and to come to a place on Sunday where nice and alone you can hear a bit more that helps you on that journey. You're called into a body with a living head with a husband who loves his bride who calls us together. Have a look at chapter 6. There's all these things we'll get to in a couple of weeks about how the people love one another in a spirit of gentleness restoring each other, sharing all these good things. If you don't know how you're doing that in this local church right now, I just want to invite you. Come close. Come close. Your family. So he longs for them to be made much of. He longs for them to be present together with him and he longs for one other thing. He longs for Christ to be formed in the Galatians. You see that pain, that endurance he goes through until Christ is formed in them. We're gonna stop and pray right now. I'm gonna ask you to pray silently with me. That Christ would be formed. Pray that Christ would be formed in somebody in this room whom you know. I want you to step into that dynamic of being close. Yes, God form Christ in me. Form Christ in us. But pause now. Lord form Christ in. This must be the heart of our life together. Yes, let's celebrate one another. Yes, let's be in community and share life together. But above all things, let's speak about Christ. Encourage one another in him. Long for him to be formed in one another. Pray that we'd be transformed into his image and likeness like he's promised to do. Because you know, I need someone who knows me well enough and has access to me to come and say to me, like a friend did last week, why aren't you, why are you living as if the gospel is not true? Somebody who sees close enough into things to see, hey, in that part of your life, you're living as if Christ isn't Lord. That you're not free. That the Holy Spirit isn't present in you. We need people that close who long to see Christ formed in you. And I should encourage you, if you haven't found that place in our church yet, come close. There are 68 community groups in the life of our church. That's about 136 members of our church who love you so much. They're providing a space for you to come and live life as Christians together. Come close. I could list a whole bunch of other opportunities you can get involved with, but please just, just come close. If you've been holding the church family at arm's length, come close. There's so many ways. Come close to Christ and to those who want to see Christ formed in you. So come back, come on, sorry, come back, come close, and come on. I'm gonna be the first to admit that the passage gets a little bit thicker at verse 21. Did you notice that? It gets a little bit harder to follow. There's a lot going on there. You kind of need a, you need a fairly strong understanding of Genesis and Exodus to make sense of what's going on here. And if you're in a community group this week, there'll be a part in the sermon questions where you can dig right into that. It's, it's, it's great. But you've got mixed metaphors of women and mountains and cities and above and below and like Isaac, and it's all just coming at you. So we're not gonna try and figure that all out right now, but to understand what Paul is doing, we need to grasp his purpose, the motivation that he's acting out of here. He's not offering a choice between freedom and slavery. He's calling believers to examine who they believe they are fundamentally at the level of self. Because fundamentally, if you've come to Christ, you're no longer natural. That's what Jesus is talking about when he's talking to Nicodemus in John chapter 3. You must be born again, that the life in Christ doesn't conform to the way of the flesh. That the growth in Christ doesn't work by the same rules that growth in everywhere else in life works. If you've been born again, natural means alone. According to the flesh will not move you forward. And so we've got to realize we didn't figure out the gospel naturally. We're not going to grow in the gospel naturally. And God's been operating this way forever. Our very self is reborn and redefined and so the whole pattern for life is different now. He's laying that out with this contrast between Sinai, Hagar, law, slavery, freedom. Not of this world, but with us presently. You're not a slave trying to obey your way to success that may come with a bit of luck. We talked about that last week with adoption. It's not who you are if you're in Christ. You're a beloved child. That is who you are and your fundamental self. A beloved child in whom the Lord delights so much that he would come and take up his dwelling in you. And our spirit testifies to our very self that we are his. And our motivation is transformed not as we try harder, not as we try to grasp that more fully, but as we embrace the identity and rest into it. As we believe his devotion and love, believe that his spirit is at work. That his spirit is more powerful than any of our ways according to the flesh. And that's the dynamic at play in that quotation in verse 27, that quotation from Isaiah. Though it may seem that following Christ, that trusting his spirit, that refusing to be flattered back into slavery, though it may seem to leave you desperate, and it may, because it's not the normal way things work, it brings such blessing that the normal ways can never bring. It looks foolish to those around us because there are quicker ways to get things done. Abraham knew that. That's why we've got this section about Hagar. There are quicker ways. There are more logical ways to get things done than trusting the spirit of the Lord and taking him at his word. But the children of the desolate one will be more than those of the one who has a husband. Don't tire of the promise. Don't look for your own ways to force God's hand and make the promise happen. Your children are the promise. The Holy Spirit is truly with you. And hear this, God has always worked this way. From Genesis through Exodus, all the way to our present day, God has always worked by promise, by his spirit. And he always will. And so your selfhood is rooted in that. That the Spirit of God has taken up his dwelling in you. You're washed clean by the blood of Christ. That you can grow because Christ is doing it. We all act out of that understanding of selfhood and it will take us years, decades, to figure this out. But let me return to that paper I quoted at the beginning. Well I didn't quote it, praise Jesus. But I'll do it now. They, in empirical research over decades, they observed this. They said whether we're doing things that we enjoy or tasks that we endure, we flourish in behaviors that are volitional, that we want to do, and accompanied by the experience of freedom and autonomy. It's what we observe in the world around us, how one another works. But the trick is that you have no freedom and no autonomy until those are bought by Christ and given as a gift to you. Until that happens, we are in slavery to sin. Reformation Day. Recovering that truth that we are set free, liberated, just by Christ. Without his death and resurrection, you spent a lifetime chasing shadows and finding emptiness. With his Spirit, you come to him and he gives generously to you and renews you at the level of your very self, so that you, as you grow with him, you're no longer just fighting at the surface. But those springs of living water, he promises, can come forth. You're a treasured child of the promise. He proclaims this to the cosmos. You are not a slave. You're his. So as we move towards the famous teaching in the next chapter about the fruit of the Spirit, remember these gospel mechanics. You're not a slave trying to put things on, trying to do extra things, trying to improve as a Christian. You're a beloved, wanted child. This is yourself whom God has chosen, whom God has put his Spirit to live in. This is yourself, if you're in Christ, if you've come to him. His Spirit is with you and he always keeps his promise. Listen to him testify to you. If you're far from him, come back. Don't be flattered out of your freedom. If you're struggling alone, come close. Come close to those who want to see Christ formed in you. And if you're starting to understand or remember who you are as a child of the promise, in whom Christ, the Spirit of Christ is forming Christ-likeness for his glory, and he won't be thwarted, he will do it. And come on, because there's joy ahead. There's persecution, there's patience, there's a whole lot of difficulty, but there's joy and there's a promise that can't help but be kept because of the one who made it. Let's pray. Lord, we barely know ourselves, but you reveal not only yourself but who you've created us to be and who you've redeemed us to be in Christ. Please, by your Spirit, would you be at work in us and among us to lead us into this freedom, to guard us from being flattered out of it, and to come close to one another as we glorify you. In Jesus' name, amen.
