Good morning, everybody. It's good to see you. My name's Ryan. It is good to be with you this morning. We're looking at Galatians chapter three. This is a chapter that deals with a question that some of you have been patiently waiting for us to answer, and that is, we've been staring at it for the last few weeks, that grace changes everything. Well, how in the world is that true? And Paul gets around to answering that question. That's what we're gonna tackle this morning. I really wasn't planning on saying this, which in most cases means that I shouldn't say this, but it occurred to me walking up this morning just after the events of yesterday, and really after the events of this week in our own city on Capitol Hill, and then what happened yesterday in Gaza Strip. You know, there are some weeks where you just feel in a palpable sense how quickly things can change in a moment. I know those of you who have had like a shocking and life-changing health situation, you know, I talk to you, and you're like, yeah, I mean, it was Monday, and then all of a sudden, life just completely changed in a moment. So it happens on the personal level, and then I think it also just kind of happens on the world level. We just have this sense things change so fast, and things that are changing that will just never really go back to normal, and what I was specifically thinking about as I was walking up this morning to the church was just, you know, for some of you, the changes this week are not just headlines that make us shake our heads and lean in a little closer to listen to the news or read the news. It's really your life work. I mean, this is really what you do every day, and so this means your life just got a lot more complicated because of what happened either this week in our own city or this week around the world. It's like, yeah, life's gonna be very different. This week's gonna be very different. I'm assuming we have folks in our church who aren't here because they're dealing with some of those things, and they may be watching this later. I also know that that's not true of everybody and that there are others of you who feel it for different reasons, right? So just watching all these parents get up here, really exciting to see you guys up here and have your kids wandering around, just making themselves at home, which is great. That's what we want. But then to think about, wow, you know, raising kids in this cultural moment is a different task than it was when I was raising my kids, and it wasn't that long ago. For some of you, you were raising kids a long time ago. I mean, don't you think about that? Like, wow, the questions they're gonna ask as they're growing up and the technology that they're dealing with. It's just like, it's a whole new game for parents and grandparents. And then for those of you just in finance and the economic world and teaching school, just all the, like, you just go down the list, and sometimes it just feels like the ground is moving underneath our feet. And it can be really disorienting. And actually, my biggest fear for us, just as a church, my biggest fear for us, for those of us who find ourselves in those places, is that all of that change can be discouraging and actually move us to a place of hopelessness. And the reason I'm grateful for you, honestly, and deeply privileged to be able to preach the gospel to you week in and week out, including today, is because it's actually the church that gets to move into the world, into all of those places, and bring hope. Now, realism, yes, but hope. And what I wanna talk about today is not so much hope in terms of what needs to change out there, because we could be here a long time talking about that, but actually hope that there can actually be change in here for you. Because this is the place discouragement starts, isn't it? It's when we get to a place in life where we feel stuck, when the pastor gets up and starts talking about how the gospel can change you and how grace changes everything, and you're kind of waving your hand, and you're saying, yeah, but it ain't changing me. And I've been doing this for a while, and I feel stuck, and I'm just not sure that I can ever change. And what Paul wants to tell you this morning is, the gospel gives a very different answer to that question, how can I change? It gives you a renewed sense of hope. Realism, absolutely, but hope that's grounded in something other than our own efforts, which should elicit a hallelujah from all of us. Hope that is anchored in what Jesus has done for us. That's what the whole book of Galatians is about, and that's what we're gonna talk about this morning. So I hadn't planned on saying that. I had planned on praying, which you should be glad that I'm gonna do that. I'm gonna pray for us and that the Lord would help us. I thank you for my brothers and sisters here. Whatever aspect of their lives feels uncertain and discouraging and frustrating, wherever they feel stuck, Lord, that you would graciously bring those things to mind, just right now, bring those things to mind. Situations at school or at work or just in our personal lives or relational lives or just things out in the world that tempt us to move to fear, discouragement, and insulation, Lord, help us in coming to this renewing vision of the gospel to find once again that our hope is really in you and in what you're doing in our lives. We pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. If Galatians 3 were an email and Paul were your friend, you would tell Paul probably you shouldn't send that email. Okay? If Paul is trying to win friends and influence people and he's trying to win the Galatians back, he probably shouldn't begin Galatians 3 with, oh, foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you? One person has paraphrased that as, oh, you dear idiots of Galatia, how could you be so idiotic? That's just not the way that you are gonna win people over who obviously have serious questions about your credibility and your faithfulness to the Lord. And yet, Paul says, send. He just sends it. And the reason he sends it is because he detects something going on in Galatia that requires a very strongly worded email. Specifically, what he detects is what a friend of mine has called Nike Christianity. All right, do you know what Nike Christianity is? We know Nike likes to tell us to just do it. All right, so Nike Christianity is this view of the Christian life that once you become a Christian, the way you grow as a Christian, the way you put aside sinful things and take on the things of the Spirit is by just doing it. So some of you are doing bad things. Just stop it. Some of you are doing good, I don't know why I'm looking over here. Some bad things. Some of you are doing good things. Over here, you're doing good things. Just keep doing it. I'm not sure which is worse, to have someone say, stop doing bad things or keep doing good things. They both make us feel in a sense like, well, I don't really know what I'm doing and Nike Christianity has an answer for that too. Great, you don't know what you're doing. Here's a list of things you should do and you better get busy trying as hard as you can to do them. Now, for some of us, that sounds perfectly normal because we walked in this morning to church and we said, yeah, isn't that what Christianity is? Isn't it just like people in my life, like my pastor and my parents and God telling me to just do it, to just try harder, to just be better? Isn't that sort of the whole idea? And Paul, just so you know, Paul isn't reserving his strongest words for those who are going off the rails in other ways. He reserves his strongest words for those who are buying into this deception. That the way that you grow as a Christian is by just trying harder. And he doesn't just say it's foolish. What's the word he uses? You are bewitched. You are under a spell. You are being duped. Why? Because Paul knows that the only way God brings lasting, real change into our lives is with his grace. How does he do that? Well, last week, Pastor Joe, who you saw doing lots of things running around this morning and did a great job, preached last week on the end of Galatians 2. And he reminded us of the fact that justification is by faith, not by works. He also, I went back and listened to the sermon. He also mentioned that he was trying something new in his preaching. If you were here, he said that he was not gonna preach a sermon that had three points that were alliterated. Do you hear that? Were any of you here for that? Some of you laughed at that. I took personal offense at that. But I found Joe's suggestion reasonable, realistic, and refreshing. And so, yeah. So our three points this morning, God changes us by his grace. Now, he really does talk about at least three things here. It's just kind of, it is kind of coincidental. By his spirit, by faith, and by the gospel. I'm not gonna spend equal time on all of these because these are themes that Paul is gonna pick back up on in later chapters. And so, bear with me here if I just kind of skip the rock off the lake. Don't worry, we'll come back and do a deeper dive, for example, on the spirit. But I do want you to notice, I do want you to notice that in the first five verses of this chapter, Paul mentions the Holy Spirit thrice. Three times. Which should tell us that what he is not about to give us is five tips on kicking that sinful habit. Okay, this is not a treatise on how to try harder. This is not even a treatise on how to remember the gospel better. We're gonna talk about remembering the gospel. But when we talk about change, you better hope that Paul begins with this basic Christian doctrine that when you became a Christian, God rushed into your life through the presence of the power, presence and power of the Holy Spirit. You better hope that's where he starts. Because we often forget this. We often think that in order for us to overcome that sinful habit that we just can't seem to get rid of, in order for us to break free of that compulsive cycle that we just can't seem to break free of, in order for us to become the kind of Christian we wanna become, we just have to start doing things. And Paul says, before you even go there and talk about doing anything, remember, as a Christian, the Holy Spirit has invaded your life. He's taken up residence in your life. He has transformed you from the inside out. He has enlightened your mind so that you love the things of God instead of hating the things of God. He's changed your heart so that you love what God loves and hate what God hates. And not only that, that renovation project that began the moment that you received Jesus by faith, that renovation project hasn't stopped. You know, we read Philippians chapter one, he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion upon the day of Christ Jesus. I just wanna cross-stitch that and put it on my wall. It is so encouraging. Bless my heart with that, right? And it is encouraging, but don't miss the end date, the timestamp that's put on that renovation project. He who began a good work in you will bring it to completion next Tuesday, you know, when you finally get your act together. No, three years from now, when you're finally the Christian you wanna be. When you're 89, when you have it all figured out. No, on the day of Jesus. Okay, that is to say your life will look like Route 66 for the rest of your life. It is endlessly under construction. I don't know what they're doing, but they're doing something and they've been doing it since 1996, right? This is actually a source of great hope for us that the Holy Spirit dwells in you. This is why, by the way, Galatians 2.20, I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. That seems like a location problem because we just confessed a second ago that Jesus is seated at the right hand of the Father. He's risen. How is it that he resides in you, Christian? It's because of the Holy Spirit resides in you. And so this is the front foot of any conversation about growing as a Christian. The Holy Spirit resides in you. He is leading you. He is changing you. He is preaching the gospel to your heart at this very moment. That's why we call it the spirit of sonship, crying out, Abba, Father, in the heart of every true believer. Now, more to come. That's the trailer to the movie that's coming up in Galatians 5, all right? But let's not miss that. Otherwise, we're gonna make Christian growth and change into this like mental exercise where you just have to remember stuff. Okay, sanctification is not a memory game. It's a supernatural work of the Holy Spirit which we participate in, point number one. Point number two, it happens by faith. So as much as everything I said I hope is true and biblical, you can check me on that, but I hope that that's true, it's actually not why Paul brings up the Holy Spirit. That was a sanctified rabbit trail we just enjoyed for the last few minutes. The reason he brings up the Holy Spirit is to point out that when you received the Holy Spirit as a Christian, you did so with the empty hands of faith and not the works of the law. So he's using the Holy Spirit in that moment when the Galatians became Christians and were filled with the Spirit and changed by the Spirit as a way of just saying, look, let's go back to that moment. You first heard the gospel. So Paul was the one who preached it. They were the ones who listened. And he's asking them in that moment when God gave you his Spirit, was it because of the works of the law or because you heard by faith? You see, Paul asks this question a few different times. Verse two, let me ask you only this. I love that, only this. Well, he's gonna ask a few more questions. He gets a little carried away. But did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith? When you received the Holy Spirit, Galatians, was it because God looked down on you and said, you know, here are some folks who kind of have their act together. They're really sincere. They're pretty moral people. They really wanna get after it spiritually. So let's give them the Holy Spirit. Or was it the fact that with the empty hands of faith, you reached out and received Jesus as your Savior? And the option is option B. I mean, that's like the easiest pop quiz ever. It's one question and it's multiple choice. When you became a Christian, did God give you his Spirit because of your good works or because of what Jesus had done? Is it because of what you did? And if I passed out that pop quiz, most of you in the room, simply by listening to Galatians for the last couple weeks, you'd be able to figure out it's option B. It's by faith that you're saved in Christ by grace. But that's not the pop quiz that Paul's giving, okay? He's not asking only about the moment of justification. What he's asking is, now that you're a Christian, how do you grow as a Christian? You gotta switch tactics, you know? If it wasn't works of the law when you were saved, why is it works of the law in order for you to change? Or could it be, as he says in verse three, that they're being foolish? They've begun with the Spirit, but now they're seeking to be perfected or completed by the flesh. See, Paul is laying out, just to put it in simple terms, he's laying out two very different ways of relating to God. One way is the way in which we just keep bringing our moral resume to God every single day, you know? Print it out, print it out on, you know, nice 12-point font, smooth it out. We bring it to God and say, God, here are all the great things that I did today. I hope that's in order for you. I hope it meets your requirements in order for you to stay off my back and to stay happy with me. And I know I didn't have my quiet time today, but I had it yesterday. And I hope that means everything is gonna go well for me today. And so we submit our moral resume and we hold our breath and we hope that he likes what we did and he approves of what we did. That's one way to relate to God for the rest of your life. Or the other way is to come to him like the kid whose dog ate his homework again. And you kind of go, I got nothing. But I do have Jesus. So if that's the way you started, why are you trying to be perfected in a different way of relating to God? That's what Paul's asking. And that's what Paul is asking us as well. Let's just clarify though what it means to hear by faith because he uses that phrase in verse two. He uses that phrase again in verse five. What does it mean to hear by faith? Because I don't want you to think that that's just like faith in faith. You hear people talking about this sometimes. Yeah, I have faith. I just have faith. I kind of have faith in things kind of work out the way they should. Or I have faith in God, kind of the big man upstairs or something. So it's not vague. He's very, very clear about what he means by hearing by faith. There's content to the faith. There's an object. He says it in verse one. It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified. The word there that's translated publicly portrayed, it's one verb in the original language. It's from the word billboard in the ancient world or placard or public sign. And so he's saying, when I preach the gospel to you, the image I put before you was the image of Christ crucified. That's what it means to hear by faith. You're putting your faith in what Jesus has done for you. That on the cross, he has paid for all of your sins and given you his righteousness. And so by the spirit, by faith, by the gospel. So this third point really emerges, I think, from the pressing question that Galatians hopefully has brought us to. It's interesting. Paul deals with the same question in Romans. But the question kind of goes like this. All right. So Ryan, you're telling me that my relationship with God is based on what Jesus has done for me on the cross and in his resurrection. And what he continues to do for me as my mediator before the father. It has nothing to do with my performance. In other words, my status before God is based on what Jesus has done and not on what I do. Is that straight? Okay, I got that straight. So if that's true, if it's true that there's nothing I can do to make God love me any more or any less, why do I need to obey? What motivation do I have to do anything good? It's not gonna change the equation. So what motivation do I have to follow Jesus, to say no to sin and say yes to righteousness? Now, if you haven't been asking that question at least a little bit over the last couple of weeks, we haven't been doing our job. Because Paul absolutely wants you to ask that question because he absolutely wants to answer that question. And the way he answers it is, the spirit working through faith changes us by the gospel. Now, the way Paul argues this is really fascinating. We see in verse six that his model for living by faith is Abraham. And the reason that's so significant is think about who he's arguing with. He's arguing with these Jewish teachers in Galatia who would see Abraham as a hero of law, of righteousness, which by the way, if you read the story of Abraham, he ain't that. Paul says, actually, no, we see in Genesis chapter 15, which he quotes in verse six here, that Abraham himself was living by faith. He was trusting in the promises of God, which would eventually be fulfilled in Jesus. And in the same way we live by faith, we don't look forward to Jesus in time, we look backwards to Jesus in time. That's why Paul goes on to say in verse 13, Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written, cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree. By the way, brilliant move all the way through here. I'm not gonna look at every single one of these Old Testament citations, but Paul knows what he's doing. He's taking the authority text of the Judaizers and he's saying, actually, that doesn't say what you think it says. This actually teaches us that the righteous shall live by faith, that the way we become righteous in God's sight is not by working our tails off, it's by reaching out the empty hands of faith and receiving what he's given us. And specifically, he draws our attention to this billboard, this placard of Christ, redeeming us from the curse of the law, how? By becoming a curse for us. You just let that sink in for a second. It almost doesn't seem right to say that, that Jesus became a curse. Paul will say elsewhere in the New Testament that Jesus became sin for us. To become a curse means that Jesus so closely identified with our sin on the cross that he was treated as the one who was cursed. And then notice the so that in verse 14. So that, in Christ Jesus, those who are united to him, how? By faith. That the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles so that we might receive the promised spirit through faith. Jesus is the cursed one. We receive his righteousness. This is why Paul says earlier that Abraham believed and it was credited, it was counted to him as righteousness. So here's the image of the gospel that we're talking about this morning, all right? The gospel tells us that when we trust in Christ, God wipes out the debt that we owed to him because of our sin, wipes it out completely. But he also deposits into our spiritual bank account the very righteousness of Christ. And think about why that's so important. Because if we didn't have that second part of the righteousness of Christ credited to our account, the Christian life really would be a sense in which we just wanna do our best to get back to zero, get back to zero. We'd always be wondering whether or not we're back to zero balance or whether we still have some kind of debt that we need to pay off. But the righteousness of Christ, the blessing of Abraham tells us that we belong to the family of God and that God delights in us as much as he delights in his own son. So, some of you knew that already. Not all of you, but some of you knew that already. Which almost makes it worse when you feel stuck. There are a lot of songs that come to mind when I think of the word change. The first one that comes to mind is a Merle Haggard song. Mama Cried. Tried, sorry, she cried and she tried. So, like most Merle Haggard songs, it's kind of depressing. But it's a story about a young man who can't get his life straightened out. And he's just determined to do bad stuff and so he just keeps doing bad stuff even though everybody in his life, his church, his family, his mama prayed for him, tried to steer him right and yet he just ends up doing wrong. And the line that sticks out to me in that song is this one. Despite all my Sunday learning, to the bad I kept on turning. Which reminds me that sometimes you can do all the right stuff and still just keep deciding to do the wrong thing. Which is really frustrating. Because we think that if we just knew the right stuff and we just put ourselves in the right situation, we just keep choosing the right thing every time but life doesn't really work that way. And so we hear things like grace changes everything and we look at our lives and there are things that we so desperately want to change, desires that we want to change, actions, behaviors, relationships that we want to change and we just don't see it happening. So how is it that the spirit working through the instrument of faith uses the gospel to change you? We could spend a lot of time talking about that. We are gonna spend some time talking about that over the next couple weeks. Let me just give you a couple things. Some of us grew up in a home in which our parents were never satisfied. You bring home a paper with an A minus on it and they go, great, could you have gotten an A? You walk off the field and you have a great game. You go three-fourth the plate and your parents say, yeah, but you really missed that one pitch. After the recital, which you've worked so hard but you knew that there were things you messed up, instead of pointing out all the things that you did so well, your parents are silent all the way home because of the mistakes that you made. Never good enough. Nothing you ever did was good enough. And some of you may feel that's the kind of situation you're in now. Some of you are my age or older and you are still living with those voices in your head. That your life is about living for a perpetually disappointed parent. Now, some of us take that experience and we just put that right on God and we say, actually, what it means to live a life with God means that we are living a life with a perpetually disappointed parent. And so the placard that we have in our minds is not the placard of Jesus spreading out his arms in love for you. It is the image of a parent with his hands on his hips looking at us as if to say, really? If he's even paying attention to us at all. And if that's your image of God, then I completely understand why the Christian life is just kind of a joyless mess. I mean, I completely understand that because if all you're doing is just trying to keep a parent who can never be happy enough or can never be happy with you because you're not doing enough, you're just trying to keep them off your back and keep them happy. I mean, I can understand why you'd be resentful and frustrated and kind of miserable. But you see, the gospel confronts that lie directly. The gospel tells us that your heavenly father is not a perpetually disappointed father. He is a perpetually delighted father, like over the top. Like really, it shouldn't even be a question of whether you're happy or not. Like over the top. Like really, it shouldn't be ice cream after every meal, but it is. Like delighting in you, loving you, actually liking you. Like when he sees you coming, loves it, wants more of it, can't get enough of it. And the evidence we have of that is right here, that Jesus came to bring you home. Not into a home that's perpetually disappointed with you, but a home that loves you and is proud of you and accepts you with joy. Now, if that's the picture, then it just changes, it changes the whole game. If obedience isn't something we have to do to earn God's love, but something we do because we have God's love, it's different, you see. It means the gospel isn't enabling us to do whatever we want. The gospel actually enables us to live joyfully for the Father who has embraced us and loves us. Point number one, that's how the gospel changes you. Point number two, the gospel changes the way that you understand your own behavior. All right, sin lesson number one. Normally when we sin, we just recognize it as a behavior that needs to stop, and it is. And if we're really reflective, we understand it as a behavior that needs to stop because it speaks to some heart issue. So if we act out sexually, we connect it to lust as we should. If we act out with our money and we're greedy or stingy, we say, I'm just being greedy or stingy, and the Bible says I shouldn't do that. If we're sacrificing way too much, including our health for the sake of our career, or because we wanna get further along in life, we recognize that rightly as perhaps pride or ambition. Yes, and amen to all of that, but the gospel helps us go deeper than that in a way that's incredibly helpful. For us to be able to say like when we act out sexually, it's not just pursuing lust, we're actually on a journey for something much deeper because all of us wanna be desirable and accepted and loved unconditionally. And when we use money in certain ways, we all understand how much money promises security in life. Like if I just had enough in the bank account that I wouldn't have to worry about stuff. How's that going by the way? If I had enough money in the bank account and in the retirement, I just don't have to worry about life anymore because you know, okay, but that's what we're after. Or our careers, our reputation, our legacy, behind that, yeah, there may be pride and ambition, maybe not, but certainly behind it for many of us is this sense in which maybe if I just get there, I will be enough. The gospel helps us see that in a way that I say that's helpful and productive because all those things that you're looking for in all those ways that are making you miserable are all the things you already have in Christ. That in Christ, you are more accepted than you will ever be by the world. In Christ, you are more secure. You have an inheritance that will never spoil or ever fade because you are in Christ. In Christ, you are desired. And that changes us. It changes the way that we think about what we're after and it changes the way we reach out with the empty hands of faith to receive what we already have. To fuel us for a life of joyful obedience and hope in the midst of difficulty. Our gracious Heavenly Father, we thank you for the gospel. The gospel of your son. Holy Spirit, we thank you for the work you're doing in our lives. We don't always understand it and yet we're grateful for it. Trusting that you will never relent or give up on your project to make us more and more into the image of our elder brother, Jesus. We thank you for that work. We ask that you would help us today to apply these gospel lessons to our lives. We ask it in Christ's name. Amen.
