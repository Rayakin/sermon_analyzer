Good morning, everybody. If we have not met yet, my name is Ryan, one of the pastors here. And if you're new, we are studying the book of Galatians this fall, and so we are coming now to, we come today to Galatians chapter 4. As I was studying this passage this week, I was reminded of something I read about Steve Jobs, Steve Jobs, the CEO of Apple who died in 2011, a biography was written about him. And in that biography, we come to find out that Steve Jobs was at times a difficult person to live with and to deal with. Sometimes he was most harsh to the people he was closest to. And as part of the explanation for some of his more extreme behavior, his biographer points out that part of Steve Jobs' story is the fact that he was adopted. And that his entire life, he was trying to reckon with this idea that he was adopted. In fact, he tells a story to the biographer that when he was six or seven years old, he was playing with some neighborhood kids. And one of the little girls in that group looked at him and found out that he was adopted and looked at him and said, well, maybe that means that your real parents didn't want you. And six or seven year old Steve Jobs runs back to the house, burst into the house. He's crying. His parents sit him down and assure him that's not the case anymore, even if that were true. The story that he's living now is the story that they love him, that they chose him out of anyone else in the world. They chose him. They wanted him to be in their family. And yet what's remarkable is here is a man who is incredibly successful, wealthy, innovative, creative, famous, brilliant. And yet at age 56, just a few months before he dies, that's the story he tells. That's the story his biographer tells to help explain why sometimes he acted the way he did. Now maybe adoption is part of your story. Maybe you're adopted. Maybe your family has adopted children. Maybe your extended family, friends have done that. And so you know that that wrestling match with family of origin is a real wrestling match for a lot of people for whom that's their story. And if that is your story, and you've even asked questions like that, it's good and healing to have people in your life who could remind you that that's not the story anymore, even if that was the story at one time, that there are people, your adoptive parents, your family, your church, your friends. We heard a testimony just a moment ago of just even how a church can surround people and heal that wound in really profound ways. It's also good for you to know that you're not the only person who asks those questions about being wanted. Psychiatrist Kurt Thompson says that every newborn enters the world looking for someone looking for him or her. That is to say, we are born into this world with this question of whether or not we belong, whether or not we're wanted, whether or not we're accepted, whether your family of origin is a great story or a not so great story, or probably, most of us, somewhere in between. And so it's interesting to me that here in chapter four of Galatians, when Paul has been talking to these Galatians about justification by faith alone, in Christ alone, by grace alone, now he goes to this doctrine of adoption, as if to say, really, the answer to your questions lies here in this proclamation that God has made, not only that you have been forgiven, but that you have been brought into the family, that you are wanted, that that question that haunts us, plagues us for years, months, decades of our lives, that question can be settled. Yes, it can be healed in really wonderful, practical ways by people in our life, but ultimately, that question is settled by the God who made us and what he has done for us through Jesus. This morning, we get to listen in on that conversation because we need it. Father, I pray that you would help us to hear these words as true, as just true. True enough that we believe it not just with our heads, but with our hearts, and that we would understand this grace that is revealed to us in this precious doctrine of adoption. That grace would change us, even today, I ask, by your Spirit, in the name of your Son. Amen. In this passage, Paul is appealing to the Galatians to remember who they are in Christ. And in doing so, he's appealing to us as well, all these years later, that he would say to you, God wants you to remember who you are in Christ. Now Paul knows he needs to jog our memory because we often forget, as we'll see here in just a moment. And so he jogs our memory, first of all, by reminding us of our relationship with God. We'll talk about that. And he's going to talk about our rescue, how it is that God rescued us through Christ. And then thirdly, our responsibility, how do we respond to that? So our relationship, our rescue, our responsibility. Paul begins in the first few verses by giving us two very stark options when it comes to relating to God. He says we are either relating to God as slaves or as sons. Not a lot of in-between, not a lot of gray area there, is it? Slaves, sons. Look at what he says in verse 7, you are no longer a slave, but a son. He's just picking up language he's been working with in the first few verses. Now just to be clear, the slavery he's talking about is not the slavery of our own history. It's not chattel slavery. It's not even the slavery that we know about going on in the world today in human trafficking. This is an institution. It's more like indentured servanthood in Paul's day. Still not great, still not ideal, but different. And yet still pretty shocking for Paul to say to these Christians, you're living like a slave. That's strong language. You're living like someone who is employed by God, not adopted by God. You're living like someone who has to earn God's favor, not someone who has it. You're living like someone who doesn't have any inheritance at all, and so you're working yourself as hard as you can just to make sure that one day you might get it. He said, you can either relate to God that way or as a son. Now we should explain that language too. You can see in the first few verses, Paul is again, like he did in chapter three, using the analogy of an inheritance, and in his culture, and in many cultures even today, the eldest son of the family is the one who would receive the inheritance, and so he's using this metaphor to talk not just about men becoming sons of God through Jesus, but also women becoming daughters of God and heirs. We see that in verse 28 in chapter three. We see it when he says that in God's family, there's no distinction, there's no difference in the way that he treats men and women. There's no superiority. There's no first and second class citizens, and so when he says sons here, we should hear sons and daughters, those who are adopted into God's family. So Paul says, you are no longer slaves, but sons. The fact that he says that in verse seven, you are no longer a slave, tells us that he's not writing to non-Christians or pagans who have never heard about Jesus. This is not an evangelistic appeal that they might come know the freedom of the gospel. No, they've already believed the gospel. They've already received Jesus as their savior. They've already accepted the message that they are redeemed and reconciled through Christ, but they have an identity crisis, like they've forgotten who they are. These are Christians that Paul is writing to and he's saying, you're living like a slave even though you're a son and a daughter. And you're thinking, well, why does that matter? Well, because that's not just something that goes on in our heads, it's something that works itself out in our lives and the way we actually live day to day. The theologian J.I. Packer, in his book, Knowing God, puts it this way, if you want to judge how well a person understands Christianity, find out how much he or she makes of the thought of being God's child. That's how you'll find out. Well, let's just take an example. Let's just say, hypothetically, this may or may not apply to you. I'll let you self-select into this little thought exercise. Let's say you're someone who struggles with a critical spirit. And by that, I mean you are somebody for whom compliments do not come very easy. People in your office would tell you that. Your friends would tell you that. But criticism, you're pretty good at that. Like to spot the good in a situation is hard for you, but to spot what's wrong with the situation, second nature. And this comes out in things said and unsaid, you know what I mean by that? Certainly critical words, but also just that look. You know the look? Someone gives you a look and you know what they're thinking. It's not, wow, you're doing a great job. It's, hmm, are you really doing what you should be doing? Or you're really not doing what you should be doing. All right. So let's just imagine someone like that. If that's not you, just imagine someone like that. Now you might explain that behavior by saying something like, and I've had someone say this to me actually one time, they said, you know, I'm just a straight shooter. I'm sorry. I can't, I can't help it. You know, you just kind of have to take it or leave it. Or I'm just kind of a glass half empty kind of person. It's just kind of how I'm wired. Or if you're kind of in a church environment, they might say, well, sorry, I just have the gift of discernment, you know, right. But there are other times, you know, when, like when the pastor calls you out in a sermon that you, maybe you feel a little bit of remorse, a little bit of conviction. And you say to yourself, all right, well, I don't really want to be like that. My parents were like that, you know, they were very critical or have a boss who was very critical. I had a roommate for instance, who was so negative. I just said to myself, I'm never going to be like that. So you resolve not going to be a critical person anymore and you get accountability partners and you listen to podcasts that help you not be a critical person and all that. And you say, I'm going to be positive. I'm going to keep a blessings journal. I'm going to be grateful. I'm going to guard my tongue and all that. And for a while it's great. And then all of a sudden you realize, nope, I'm still captain critical. Like I'm still the person who just always points out what's wrong with people. I just, it's almost like I can't help myself. Now, why didn't your little exercise and discipline work? Because what's coming out in a critical spirit and in critical words and in things said and unsaid is not just a behavior problem that you need to tweak. What's behind it is an identity problem, right? Because it's the slave mindset with God that says, look, here I am working extremely hard for God, keeping all the rules, not doing the things I want to do. Trust me, I want to do those things, but I'm not doing those things. And the things that I am doing, I don't really want to do those things, but I'm doing those things because I'm a good soldier. I'm a good servant. I'm a good worker. And everyone around me doesn't seem to care or notice or follow suit. They're not doing what I am doing. They're not doing what I want them to do. So it's my job to point out to them what it looks like to be a good worker in God's kingdom versus a son or a daughter who says, you know, I'm not earning room and board here. Everything that Jesus has is mine. And I don't have to tear other people down in order to build myself up because I am built up in Christ, not in my performance. And I don't have to point out to everyone else all the things they're doing wrong because, you know, the Holy Spirit's real and that's his job, not mine. And I have enough things wrong with me that I can be honest about because I have the full rights and privileges of a child, because I have a heavenly father who delights in me and loves me. These are two very different ways of relating. And Paul, at the very beginning here, is setting these out before us and asking, which relationship are you living out of, a slave or a son? Now in order to reinforce this, Paul then describes for us our rescue. We have some friends who adopted three amazing kids from overseas, and they celebrate birthdays, but they also celebrate gotcha days, okay? And the gotcha day is the day that they went and they got them. And in their case, took them out of a very difficult situation in an orphanage and brought them home. And trust me, it wasn't a cakewalk. It was tough. But they did it, and they did it willingly, sacrificially, at a great cost financially in terms of time and energy and generosity, but they did it, and they were glad they did it, and they loved to celebrate that rescue story with their kids, which was formative. It reminded them how much they wanted him, they wanted her in their lives. And maybe, again, maybe that's part of your story, maybe that's part of your family's story. And yet, even the best gotcha story in the world, we probably have some good ones here in the room as my guests, even the best one pales in comparison to this one, to the gotcha story of how it is that God rescued you in order for you to be part of his family. Verses four, five, and six, some of my favorite verses, definitely in Galatians, maybe in the Bible. I've preached a sermon series on these verses. I will not do that to you today. Critical spirit's already coming my way. I get it. I'm not going to push my luck. I just want to point out two things about what four, five, and six tell us. First of all, I want you to see that in order to adopt you, God sent his son in the fullness of time, God sent forth his son, born of a woman, born under the law to redeem those under the law. God sent what was most precious to him to rescue you. God sent his son, notice in verse five, to redeem those under the law, that is to buy us out of slavery, and to adopt us in his family. Now I want you to see those two movements of this rescue because I think we often get the first one, we sort of get that down, it's just kind of ingrained in us. For those of us who are Christians, or if you're sort of thinking about Christianity, you've heard enough by now over the last couple weeks, Jesus came to redeem us, to purchase us with his blood. We sang about it a few moments ago, to forgive us of our sin, to make us clean, to reconcile us, we kind of have that part down. It's the second part of the rescue that often doesn't make its way from our heads to our hearts, that he has also received us, that we might be sons and daughters with all the rights and privileges that go along with that. That part, that part we sometimes have a hard time believing, that God really thinks of us that way. The other day I was in Giant, and I was going to the poultry section to get some chicken, and as I'm walking up to that refrigerated area, I'm walking up, there's a woman off to my left, and I start kind of sorting through some packages, and as I'm walking up, she's like sorting through the packages, and she's got a baseball hat on, and a mask on, and what I thought was an apron on, you can see where this is going, and so I kind of pulled something off, and I was like, huh, I wonder if I have something else, I kind of looked over and I said, hey, do you know if this is somewhere, and she kind of looks at me, and she goes, I don't know, I'm like, oh, okay, sorry, and she goes, why would you ask me that? And I was like, I don't, sorry, and she said, do I look like I work here? Now I stammered something out, it's embarrassing, and I think we've all done it, but what I was actually thinking was, yeah, I mean, actually, you look exactly, you are dressing like you, like you want me to think that you work here, you're doing the things that people who work here do, like you're sorting through, like I thought you were scanning the packages, and you're dressed like the person over there, that person works here, you're dressed, okay, I didn't say any of that, you're probably glad to know that I didn't at our neighborhood giant, but I'm thinking, yeah, you look like you work here, and then I was thinking as I was walking away, embarrassed, I wonder what people in our lives would say about us when it comes to the way we go through life, like, you know, here we are in church, we're talking about adoption, we're talking about sonship, we're talking about the liberating power of grace, and we think we give off, like, man, we are free in Christ, when actually people looked at us, they would say, actually, you kind of look like you're miserable, like you look like you work here, like, you know, you say you're free, but you're so anxious, and you say that you trust that God has your life in his hands, because he's your heavenly father, but you are as fearful as anybody else, and you believe that you have this inheritance that's eternal, that you can't even imagine, and you have this scarcity mindset about money? You're always fearful there's not enough money? Would you get mistaken as someone who works in the kingdom, or someone who belongs to the kingdom as a child? So I was doubly convicted that day. But Paul says, thankfully, God doesn't just send his son, he knows that we are prone to this identity crisis, and so in verse six, we're told he also sends his spirit. Would you just look at that verse, if you haven't looked at it yet? This is a good one, I mean, they're all good, this is a good one to memorize, and because you are sons, because you are sons, because you are, because you are, God sent the spirit of his son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father. The word Abba, you may know, it's an Aramaic word, it just means it's a really old word, but it's the word father, in Aramaic, but it's the word that small children would use to talk to their dad, and so they would probably, it's a word like dad, or papa, you know, most three-year-olds don't walk up to their father and say, father, you know, son, daughter, right, what do you say? Say, dad, papa, daddy, and notice that the Holy Spirit here, given to us to reside within us, is crying out, there's a spontaneity to it, which is also true to form. Like, look, even if you didn't have a great relationship with your dad or with your parents, or even if it's just complicated, you can just listen, if you listen carefully in the room here, or if you're observing on your way in and out of church, the spontaneity that happens when you have children around their parents, like, they're not asking permission to run up and put their arms around dad's leg, right, and walk around like this, they're not asking permission to climb up in his arms and put their hands on his face and say, look at me, I want to talk to you, let's go to lunch, right, they're not asking permission to do that, why? Because they have access. And what we're being given here is the cry of the Holy Spirit in our hearts is this testimony, this inward testimony that reminds us who we are and the kind of access you have, you don't have to earn it, you never earned it, you have it, and it's the Spirit that reminds us that we are sons and daughters. You don't have to ask permission, in fact, God doesn't want you to ask, God is giving you the words to say, call me Abba, because that's who I am. Do you see how that story of rescue, that gotcha story just begins to work into your heart, say, God sent his Son, his Spirit for me? Yes. So how should we respond? How do we respond to this story? Let me say number one. You have to put yourself within earshot of the Holy Spirit. And that is not a very theologically sophisticated statement, because some of you are like, well, I thought the Holy Spirit is everywhere and he's always residing within us, and that much is true. What I mean, though, is that God has told us that there are certain places in which his voice is most concentrated. He said, this is where you hear my voice, my word. This is where you hear my voice. This is where I've shown you who I am. This is where we rehearse the gotcha story over and over again. And so corporate worship is a place the Holy Spirit meets with us. God promises to meet with his people and speak to us, and we have this chance to speak back to him and hear the inward testimony of the Holy Spirit, reminding you who you are. So being here is good. We have folks out at Reston today. Being in Reston is good. We have folks in Fairfax. Being in Fairfax is good. Being with God's people is putting yourself within earshot of the Holy Spirit every morning, every afternoon, or every evening. Opening God's word doesn't have to be for an hour in the original language. If you want to do that, you go right ahead. It just needs to be a few minutes in the car, on your phone, listening to God's word, hearing God's voice, and speaking back to him, not Father, but Abba. Francis Schaeffer was once asked to define prayer, and he said, it's just a child talking to his father. That's all it is. Put yourself within earshot. Secondly, Paul says, don't go back. Don't go back. That's the whole thrust of the second part of the passage, verse 9. How can you turn back again? Not only do you know God, but even, it's probably more right to say, to be known by God. So don't go back. He says earlier to the Jewish Christians, those who converted out of Judaism, don't go back to the elementary principles of the law. He's saying to these Gentile Christians, those who came out of pagan Christianity, don't go back to those pagan religions. Both have their own form of slavery, which is earning your salvation. The uncertainty, the fear, the wondering of whether or not you're really ever going to be good enough. Paul says, why would you go back to that? It's like putting yourself back in prison. Don't go back. Rather, recognize how it is actually the gospel that changes you so that you want to obey. I know we have a hymn sing tonight. I don't know that we'll get to this one, but here's an old hymn that says this. To see the law of Christ fulfilled, to hear his pardoning voice, changes a slave into a child and duty into choice. That leads us to our third response. Paul is saying, you are no longer a slave, but a son. And the implication here is so act like it. Act like it. You know, when my kids were growing up, and they'd be so excited to get their new jersey, their new soccer jersey, or flag football jersey, or baseball jersey. And sometimes it had our name on the back. I have this photo in my mind of one of our kids got his new jersey, and it had the name Laughlin on the back. And the photo is him doing one of these, like, rah, like that. And I'm like, well, that doesn't mean you're going pro based on the genetic pool. But what it does mean, what it does mean is that you are now taking our name onto the field. So you're doing it to yourself, buddy. It's not just about you anymore. You're part of the family. You bear the name. The Bible tells us we bear the name of Christ in the world. It's not just about you anymore. You've been declared a son, and Paul's saying, go act like it. That's why the Bible says things like, forgive. How? As God has forgiven you. Oh, that's how we do it in the family. That's how we do it. Be long-suffering with one another. That's just a big, long word for be patient. Why? Because God's been patient with you, and long-suffering. Love sacrificially. Why? Because Christ died for you. Give generously of your time, talent, and treasure. Why? Because Christ, though he was rich, became poor so that we might be rich in him. Once you see it, you can't unsee it. It's about bearing the family name in such a way that we live the family traits. And this isn't just your project, by the way. You know, he's not just sending us on the field. Go get them, tiger. We have the Holy Spirit. What are we told the Holy Spirit is doing? He's making us more and more into the image of our father. So when people look at you, they go, you look just like your dad. Not always good news. In this case, good news. Actually, my favorite story about this is from a movie I watched a billion times when my kids were growing up, Toy Story 2, which I would still watch a billion times. It's a great movie, Toy Story 2. And at the end of the movie, there are two Buzz Lightyears. I'm sorry I can't explain the whole plot, but just try to keep up, okay? Toy Story 2. Buzz Lightyear, there are two Buzz Lightyears at the end of the story. This toy. And they're all trying to figure out which is the real Buzz Lightyear. They're having this argument about who it is. And the conclusive evidence, the one that seals the deal, is what? You remember this? Buzz lifts up his foot. And he's got a name written on his foot. Scrawled in black magic marker, Andy. The boy who made Buzz his own. God is reminding us in this passage that you belong to him. That he has written his name on you. That he's claimed you as his own. That he has rescued you. Not just from your sin, but from the fear that you don't belong. You do. For he has made you his own. And he sends us out with his spirit to act like it. Let's pray together. Father, we thank you for your gospel, which is good news to us. Not just once or twice, but every day. And especially this doctrine of adoption, which speaks so clearly to many of our fears and anxieties in this world. You have given us the definitive answer in Jesus. And you have given us a reminder of who we are with the Holy Spirit. We pray that today, my friends here who are struggling with not knowing whether or not they belong. Or really not knowing if there are answers to their questions. Would see in Jesus a beautiful and compelling answer. The one who has come to give us all that we need. May we look to him and trust him. And we pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
