Well, good evening and Merry Christmas. Great job, yeah, that's good enough. You know, it's late, it's dark, it's cold. My name is Joe. I serve as the pastor for young adults here at McLean Presbyterian Church and it is a joy to be worshiping with you this night. Especially first, I just wanna say how impressed I am that you all are here and from me, you get extra credit points towards whatever that might be good for, but as a pastor of young adults, it doesn't really go very far. Ask Ryan if you want the real extra credit points. He might hook you up a little bit more. But it is good to be here and really on a more serious note, it's just good to be with God's people worshiping him. Right, the one from on high who was made low for our sake that we might be made like him. So let's pray and then dive in to God's word together. Heavenly Father, this evening we are grateful. We're grateful that we are here, gathered in your house with your people. We are grateful that 2,000 years ago, a baby named Jesus was born. A baby who was fully God and fully man. Who came that the darkness might not win or that sorrow might not have the last word and that sin would not be victorious. So this evening, we pray that your power would be present and tangible as we experience you through your word. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. Amen. So as we begin to think about Jesus this evening, I want us to start by thinking a little bit about promises. I don't know all of you in this room tonight, so I don't know quite where you stand on promises. Some of you, promises might be easy, both to make and to receive from other people. You have no reason to doubt a promise when it's made to you. Others of us, though, for whatever reason, depending on our stories, when we hear a promise, cynicism immediately starts creeping in. We've been burned one too many times by one too many people and so whenever we hear the, I'll be there, I promise, we really don't believe it. Now, of course, most of us are somewhere in between those two extremes. It really depends on who's making the promise, right? Show me who's making it and then I'll tell you whether or not I believe it. Something we can all recognize, though, is that promises are incredibly powerful. They can instill hope, confidence, and trust and yet promises are also frighteningly fragile and when they break, they're rather sharp. They leave us hurting, confused, and without anybody to trust. And so whether or not we have good experiences or bad, it's helpful just to note that Christmas Day, right, Christmas as a day is all about promises. Sure, it's about promises that family members make to each other, I'll be there, I promise, not expecting a torrential downpour a few days before Christmas that freezes over but it's also, right, about the implicit promises of presents spoken months before they're given and since forgotten about but Christmas in all of its beauty and brokenness, right, is about the promises of God and it's to one such promise that we turn our attention this evening. It's one that we've been looking at for the past couple of months and this is the last day that we'll have our chance to put our heads and our hearts to work to understand it. Comes from Isaiah chapter nine. If you have a Bible with you or a Bible in front of you, I encourage you to take it out. Isaiah is in the Old Testament. After the Psalms, you'll find it somewhere. Just keep flipping. If you've gone to Matthew, you're too far. You can flip backwards but we're in Isaiah chapter nine. I'm gonna read verses one through seven and as I read this passage, especially I want us to listen for two words. All right, listen for the word about a son and the word about a throne. So a son and a throne. Let's hear, though, God's word together from Isaiah chapter nine. But there will be no gloom for her who is in anguish. In the former time, he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali. But in the latter time, he has made glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations. The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light. Those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shone. You have multiplied the nation. You have increased its joy. They rejoice before you as with joy at the harvest, as they are glad when they divide the spoil. For the yoke of his burden and the staff for his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, you have broken as on the day of Midian. For every boots of the tramping warrior in battle tumult and every garment rolled in blood will be burned as fuel for the fire. For to us, a child is born. To us, a son is given. And the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and of peace, there will be no end. On the throne of David and over his kingdom to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this. This is the word of the Lord. Amen. So did you catch, right, what we were listening for? A son and a throne. Verse six, to us, a son is given. And we're told in verse seven that this son will sit on the throne of somebody named David and will be established over his kingdom. Right, in other words, God is promising through the prophet Isaiah a son of David. And this is what we're actually gonna think through together tonight just under two headings, right? The significance of David and the son of David. The significance of David and the son of David. And here's the thing, right? We can just be honest for a second. You're all here on Christmas night. Normally on Christmas, we spend our day talking about Jesus and yet you're coming here and we're gonna talk about somebody named David for a little bit. Like, all right, Mr. Preacher Man, why are you ruining my Christmas vibes tonight? I'm trying to stay focused. Well, we'll get there, I promise. Hang in there with me. Because I wonder, right, as we come to this idea of David, if you've ever had the experience of walking into a room where somebody's watching a movie and they're about halfway through, right? Whether it's a parent, a sibling, a roommate, you come into the room, they're halfway through and you have absolutely no idea what's going on. And if you are like some people, who I won't mention any names, you start asking a lot of questions to that person who's already put in the hard work of watching the movie for an hour. Who's that guy? Wait a second, why did he just do that? I don't understand what's going on there, right? You come into the middle of a story and you have no context for what's going on. That's a little bit like what we're doing as we read this promise of Isaiah about a son of David sitting on the throne of a kingdom. We hear this name, David, and unless we understand the larger story in which this is taking place, we really don't stand a chance to have our heads and our hearts employed in any way meaningful this Christmas. And so I wanna start, right, as we consider this person named David by telling you a story. Because we all know implicitly, rather, whether it's a story, right, in a movie or history, that context matters, right? The character of a person is dependent upon their story. I mean, a scripture is one big story of God's work in this world, of his determination to claim a people from himself out of darkness, out of sin, and through this people to redeem the whole world. Right, and as proof of this divine determination, God leaves a trail of promises. All across the Old and the New Testaments, you hear God's promise again and again and again. It starts all the way back in Genesis chapter three, the third chapter of the Bible. After sin enters the world, God promises that a child will one day be born who crushes Satan under his feet, who puts an end to the powers of darkness and of death. And this promise, though, gets picked up again, right? It starts in Genesis, gets picked up again when God calls Abraham, right, a patriarch in Genesis chapter 11, and promises that through Abraham, specifically through his offspring, the entire world will be blessed. He doesn't give a lot of information about how exactly this will happen, but he says, Abraham, I will make of you a great nation, and through your nation, many people will receive blessing. And on and on it goes, more promises build until, right, God calls a man named David. Enter in David, right, the important part of what we're getting at. And he calls David to be a king. You see, God's people, Israel, had been without a king for many years, up until a guy named Saul, who was not a good king at all. And so God asks, or God calls, commands David to be king. But interestingly, right, you read Isaiah chapter nine, and David seems pretty established as a king, but if you met him when he was called, you wouldn't expect David to be a king. You see, David was the youngest of eight brothers. He was a shepherd, probably smelled like one too. He wasn't even there when God called him to be a king. His brothers had to go and get him from the field to say, guess what, you're the one. Right, if you met David when he's introduced in the scriptures, you wouldn't expect him to be king. He was an unlikely king. And yet, this David was chosen by God to rule over Israel. God often chooses the unlikeliest of people to do the most incredible of things, and David did a lot of good things. Because it turns out, actually, that David was a good king, and not only a good king, he was actually a great king. David enlarged the borders of Israel. He did things that God told him to do. He brought people to worship God, the God of their fathers. He was a great king. He killed Israel's enemies and brought peace to the entire land. He enriched their people. He built out Jerusalem. He negotiated treaties with foreign powers. He was a great king. But strangely, God makes a promise to David, not that David himself would be the ultimate king, but that he actually needed somebody else. You see, David made a promise to David, or God made a promise to David, this great king that was focused not on David and what David could accomplish, but what his offspring, his descendant, would one day do. It's recorded in 2 Samuel 7, right? God's promise. He says, when your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, once you die, David, God says, I will raise up your offspring after you who shall come from your body and I will establish his kingdom. He will build a house for my name and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be to your offspring, a father, and he will be to me, a son. You see, this promise ends up being very, very good news for the people of Israel because David sure was an unlikely king. He was even a great king, but ultimately David was an imperfect king. David, just like all who came before him and all who would come after him, fell. David had figured out how to rule and defend the people of Israel. He had figured out how to conquer Israel's enemies and establish security, and yet he was brought down by something incredibly mundane, quite ordinary, his own heart. Because David, even as he sought to conquer the enemies of Israel, forgot about the darkness that lied within, forgot about his own disordered, broken, and sinful heart. So David too, sinned against God and fell. But then came Solomon, David's son, and for a time he looked very promising. He was wise beyond measure. He even built a temple for God to dwell in. Maybe this son, this king would be the promised one. But then Solomon too, fell. He wasn't the one after all who the people of Israel were waiting for. And after Solomon, things didn't get much better. The entire nation of Israel split in two, and there was a king in the north in Israel, a king in the south in Judah, and some kings were good, some kings were bad, but all ultimately were imperfect. None ever did what God had promised that a son of David would do. Quite simply, the legacy that David left through his offspring, through his descendants, just wasn't that impressive. It wasn't what the people expected. But again, God does something a little strange. You see, as the fulfillment of God's promise about David's offspring, as that fulfillment grew less and less likely, we would probably expect some sort of modification to the promise, right? Some kind of slight backing off on God's part as he sees the people not doing what he promised. God does modify his promise, but in a direction we actually don't expect. You see, throughout scripture, after David, as kings rise and kings fall, God keeps repeating his promise about David's descendants, but his promises don't get smaller or less intense. They grow in scope and anticipation. Listen just with me to some of the promises that the prophets of God record after David. This is from a prophet named Jeremiah. "'It shall come to pass one day,' declares the Lord of hosts, "'that I will break his yoke from off your neck, "'and I will burst your bonds. "'The people will serve the Lord their God "'and David their king forever.'" So it goes from promising an everlasting king to a king that will break off the bonds forever. Here, this promise from the prophet Ezekiel. God says that, "'I will save all the people from the backslidings "'in which they have sinned, "'and I will cleanse them, "'and they will be my people, "'and I will be their God. "'My servant David will be king over them, "'and they will all have one shepherd. "'They will dwell in the land that I give "'to my servant Jacob, where your fathers lived. "'They and their children and their children's children "'will dwell there forever. "'And David, my servant, will be their prince forever.'" You see, David was a good king, even a great king, right? He temporarily burst the bonds of foreign oppressors, but he couldn't do anything about the bonds on his hearts or ours. David was a great king, but he couldn't cleanse himself or his people of their sin. He was a great king, but he couldn't promise an eternity of peace and security. So for just a second, this Christmas evening, I want us to just agree to stop pretending, right? As bright as we can make the lights, as much as we can enjoy the warmth of our houses, as much as we can give the right presents to the right people, things are not all as they ought to be. Even if today is the best Christmas you've ever had, and praise God for that, all it takes is lifting your eyes to the wider world to see that things aren't right. All it takes is lifting your eyes to see what is wrong and dark and scary. And as we look out, right, we can actually realize that we are all longing for a kingdom, a kingdom not that we've seen in this world that even with all expectation never fills out what we hope for. But we're longing for a kingdom of peace and of justice. One where wrong things are put right, where evil doesn't stand a chance. One where we have no cause to fear our neighbor or our friend or ourselves. And this longing, right, this recognition that things aren't right on the one hand, and this other idea of longing for things to be made right is not a defect or maybe more politely a childish whim, right, that needs to be kind of stamped out of us. This longing is the result of being made in the image of God, being made in the image of the king himself. When things get dark and go wrong, we're tempted to dismiss this longing, tempted to explain it away as a leftover of fairy tales we heard as a kid or childish naivety. But what if instead of an opportunity to dismiss this longing, we saw the darkness around us as an invitation to step even deeper into it? One poet puts it this way, it gets darker and darker, and then Jesus is born. The darkness of this world does not prevent the fulfillment of the promises of God, rather the darkness of this world is a precondition for their fulfillment. Because it's precisely in these darkest moments, the most unredeemable moments that the word of God comes to us with breathtaking clarity and almost an unbelievable promise like the one we read in Isaiah chapter nine, the people who walked in darkness have seen a great light. Those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shown. You see, David is significant to us today, not because he's some king in a history book, but because we can see ourselves and our longings reflected back to us in him. As we see a king who was supposed to accomplish great things and did indeed, but ultimately fell, we see our own hopes misplaced in human kings and human people, almost fulfilled and yet never quite. The significance of David for us is to recognize that we need a king and to see our own darkness. For to us, a child is born. To us, a son is given and the government will be upon his shoulder. His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and of peace, there will be no end on the throne of David and over his kingdom to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore. Into a world full of promises kept and many more promises broken, Jesus arrives. The promise of God in the flesh to be the son of David, to be the king spoken of in Isaiah chapter nine because God isn't a God of the do-over. He's not a God of the, oh, I messed up there. Our God is a God of kept promises. Jesus comes as the fulfillment of God's promises spoken in Genesis three, reiterated in 2 Samuel chapter seven given again and again in Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Isaiah. We've looked through this tour of the Old Testament promises to realize that these promises weren't just for people back then, but they are for promises, they are promises for us right here and right now. This Christmas, I would humbly and pretty firmly say, you need the son of David to be your king because this is after all what the promise is about. Jesus comes as our savior. He's the gift of God free to us of incredible cost to God himself. He comes to be like us, to bear our shame and our sin. And he does this, but we're missing something. If somewhere along the way, we view the baby Jesus as our get out of jail free card and not as our righteous and forever king. To us, a child is born, to us, a son of given. The government will be upon his shoulders of the increase of his government and of peace. There will be no end. That's what the son of David is about. That's who Jesus is, our savior and our king because he rescues us from darkness and he rules us in peace and in justice. So briefly to close, how does Jesus fulfill this promise? How does he rule us now as a son of David? You know, our tradition, right? As Presbyterians actually gives us a good answer to this question of how is Jesus a king, right? It's in something called the shorter catechism. There's a question in that posed, how does Christ execute this office of king? And the answer, Christ executes the office of a king by subduing us to himself, by ruling and defending us and in restraining and conquering all his and our enemies. And it's that last part that I want you to hear. Christ executes the office of a king by restraining and conquering all his and all our enemies. Christ accomplishes for us what David couldn't do for himself. He subdues us to himself by restraining and conquering our enemies. Right, David could do maybe 50% of that. He was able to conquer the external enemies of foreign powers, but he didn't stand a chance against his own sin and his own brokenness. Christ comes as king and shows us that the first enemy we need to reckon with, the enemy that will ultimately conquer us if left alone is sin. Right, and this idea of sin, all it means is that we are ruled by someone or something. And if it's not God, we're in sin. We are separated from God by sin, right? The one who created us to be ruled by him in his grace, his holiness and power of justice, peace, and eternity. In this world, so many of us have traded our loyalties to a lesser king. Right, we are maybe ruled by our greed, even when we don't call it as much and instead disguise it as setting ourselves up well for retirement or caring for our kids well. Right, we are ruled by our lust, the glowing screen on our computer or our wandering eyes and imagination. We're ruled by our need for control, justifying ruthless and unkind behavior because we think we could do it all better. So this evening, if you've never reckoned with this reality, with your sin, the way that it bends and twists your hearts, the sad news is that you won't fully understand the miracle, the wonder, the joy of Christmas. But the incredible thing is exactly what we said earlier. As we see the darkness out there in our world, but the darkness in our own hearts on this Christmas, it's not condemnation, but it's an invitation. Not to turn in on ourselves and lose all hope, but with one another, with the spirit of God, to fix our eyes on the light of the world who has indeed arrived, not only as a light, but as our King, as the greater Son of David. Because you see, Christ comes as the Son of David, as King, and upends our expectations of what a King will do. Before conquering our external enemies, He sends His spirit to conquer that enemy which is closer than we could ever realize, the enemy of sin in our hearts. And you see, that's what this first Christmas, about 2,000 years ago, the arrival of a baby who is a King and who will do what no King before him has ever hoped to accomplish. Where every King before Jesus was broken by the weight of his own sin, Jesus will bear the sin of each and every one of us. He will take it on Himself on the cross and He will fall under its weight to death. But Jesus is not a defeated King. Because though death would strike, Jesus would reign victorious. How does Christ execute the office of a King? By subduing us to Himself, ruling and defending us, and restraining and conquering all His and our enemies. But just because Jesus comes first and foremost, right, to deal with our spiritual enemies, to deal with darkness and with sin, doesn't mean that He's ignorant or unaware of our enemies that are external to us. You see, Christmas is a climactic holiday, both here within the church and in our wider culture. There's a lot of buildup, a lot of expectation, a lot of anticipation that leads up to this. Some years it's great, other years it's not, but December 26th always comes, and with it, a return to the ordinary, a return to the dark. But rightly considered, Christmas is not the end, it's a pointer. You see, Jesus is born as a King, is reigning right now as a King, and He will one day return as a King. We've yet to see all things in subjection under Him, but there is a day coming, a day coming when Jesus Himself will return, and this time not as a baby, not quietly, but as a King, making the final assault on death, darkness, and sin. The book of Revelation records this well. Just hear these few verses from Revelation 19. I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. The one sitting on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness, He judges and makes war. His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on His head are many diadems, and He has a name written that no one knows but Himself. He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and the name by which He is called is the Word of God. And the armies of heaven, arrayed in fine linen, white and pure, were following Him on white horses. He will tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty on His robe and on His thigh. He has a name written, King of Kings and Lord of Lords. The Bible is full of stories about people who heard the promises of God and thought that they were excellent promises, promises that they hoped to come true, but they couldn't wait for it, so they decided to take matters into their own hands, to bring about God's promises on their timing and their way. But I would suggest this evening, we close as Isaiah 9, verse 7 closes, remembering that God's promises don't come true by our power, by our ability, by what we might accomplish. God tells us that the zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this. We began by talking about promises. I don't know where you are tonight with the idea of promises, but I would suggest to you that you can promise this one, that Jesus has come and He will come again, because Christmas is proof that when God makes a promise, He keeps it. And so hear this from His Word, right? Christ has come, Christ will come again. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this. Let's pray. Father, we're grateful for the gift of Your Word, the Word that became flesh that we might see You and experience grace, joy, and righteousness forever. Be with us this evening as we leave this place. Help us to trust Your promises. In Jesus' name, Amen.
