Well, good morning to you all. My name is Ryan and it's my pleasure to open God's word with you this morning. Let's pray together. Father, we pray that as we open up to this passage about what feels like a very relevant topic of taxes and responsibility to government and that place in our lives, we pray that you would meet with us, Holy Spirit, that the word might in fact for us very practically be living and active as it truly is, that it would help us to see our own hearts, help us to see our own lives, that we might live a life before you, the true and living God that brings you glory and honor in every aspect of our lives. Help us to do this, Lord. We pray in Jesus name, amen. Well, this time of year, my home office starts looking a little more messy because I'm thinking about, I haven't gotten there yet, but I'm thinking about filing my taxes. And so I'm doing what probably most of you are doing right now, and that is collecting forms with numbers on them that you look at once a year and you're just like, what is a 1098? I just, okay. And you start collecting all those. And then there's that folder that you've had in the filing cabinet. You just kept cramming receipts in there. And now you're like, why did I put this in here? And so you're going through the process of just getting ready to file. Now, some of you are looking at me like I filed a number of weeks ago. Good for you. All right, good for you. Some of you are much more organized than the rest of us, and that's good. Now, there are some of you who are like, about five minutes ago, you heard this passage read and you're like, taxes. Okay, I got to get on that. So some of you, your home office looks pristine because you haven't started that process of gathering forms and gathering information. But we do that not because somewhere in the back of our minds, we're asking if paying our taxes is lawful. It may not be enjoyable. We may have questions about the amount. We may have questions about where those taxes are going. But the basic question, should I pay them? I hope is more or less settled for you because there is such a thing as tax evasion and tax fraud. And there are people in this room who would be happy to talk to you all about those things. So the question that's being raised in this text isn't exactly a live question for us, although the issue of taxes remains polarizing today for different reasons. But the question that's being asked here is the question of lawfulness. Did you catch that in the question that comes to Jesus in verse 14? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay them or should we not? Now to understand why they're asking them this question, you have to rewind the tape a little bit and remember that they are standing in an occupied city. They're standing in Jerusalem. OK, this is the week that later this week Jesus will be executed by the Roman authorities. Those Roman authorities have a strong presence in Jerusalem, a garrison of soldiers there. Over the years, they have desecrated the holy temple of the Jews. They have mocked their customs and traditions. They have treated them with brute force and violence. And so the question that's being asked here is a question that's been asked for the last 30 years leading up to this when the census tax was first introduced. Are we obligated to basically fund the occupying force or not? This was such a live question that when the tax was first introduced, there was a man named Judas, not the Judas among Jesus's disciples, but a man named Judas the Galilean. That's what one historian calls him. You can read about him in Acts chapter 5. And when this tax was first introduced, he founded a sect of Jews who said we're not paying that tax. And that was really the founding of the zealots that you read about in the New Testament. And so we know that there was a strong reaction to the very idea that the Jews would have to fund and support an occupying force. And so they come to Jesus and they ask, should we pay this tax or not? Interesting cultural question, interesting ethics exam, but that's not what's going on here. Mark tells us in verse 13 that they have been sent by somebody. This is a delegation. And if you kind of go back a little further into chapter 11, you realize the they, the mysterious they, are the chief priests and the scribes, the high ranking, the top brass of the of the religious leadership in Jerusalem. They're the ones we read in chapter 11, verse 18. We looked at this a couple of weeks ago, who are seeking to destroy Jesus. They're looking to take him out. What's the problem, though? The problem is that he is wildly popular. And every time they try to arrest him or catch him, he just outsmarts them. And the people love it. I mean, who doesn't like to see the elites kind of getting theirs? Like Jesus is sticking it to the man every chance he gets. People love him. And it's Passover and there's nationalistic fervor going on in Jerusalem. Jesus just marched in triumphantly and he is wildly popular. And so they are trying to figure out a way for Jesus to incriminate himself. And so they have this idea. Let's send the Pharisees and the Herodians, by the way, they didn't hang out a whole lot. But they did have this much in common. Let's catch Jesus, or as Mark says, let's trap Jesus in his own word. Let's give him an answer or a question there's no good answer to. So, Jesus, is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not? If Jesus says yes, what is he? He's a collaborator. He's a sellout to the people. He's going along with the program. He's compromising. If he says no, the Herodians, this was kind of like a pro-government group within the Jewish ranks, the Herodians would have had a field day. They would have reported him and he would have been labeled just like Judas the Galilean 30 years ago, as a rebel, as someone who is trying to bring conspiracy against the Roman government. Either way, yes or no, he's trapped. There is no good answer to this question. And again, it's not an honest exploration of the issue. It is a loyalty test. Jesus, who do you answer to? Do you answer to Caesar? Do you answer to God? Who are you most loyal to? Is it Caesar? Is it the authorities of this world? Or is it your creator? Is it God himself? All right, you got it? So, Jesus does what any of us would do in this situation. He asked for a coin. Okay? And with that coin, Jesus does something brilliant. He passes their loyalty test with flying colors and at the same time, gives us his own loyalty test. But here's the difference. Their loyalty test was meant to trap them, trap him in order to destroy him. His loyalty test is given to us this morning in order to liberate us and to give us life. And so, this morning, what I want to do is we walk through the short passage. It may be really familiar to you. Maybe the first time you've ever heard it before. I want to allow Jesus to give us a loyalty test, to ask us, where does your deepest allegiance lie? Who ultimately has your loyalty? Is it Caesar? Or is it your creator? Now, the first option might seem sort of odd to us. You know, normally, we don't think about Caesar having any role in our lives and truthfully, he doesn't. Maybe Caesar's salad has a role in our lives in some way. Little Caesar's pizza, maybe. And we can think of some other analogies. But the whole idea of Caesar is, you know, just that seems antiquated, not something that's relevant to our lives. And this is where knowing what Jesus does with the coin is really helpful because this brings it down into our lives as well. So I brought with me this morning a dime. All right, kids, you see that? OK, good. I got a yes over here. Thank you. Someone's paying attention. And by the way, whoever sang this morning, you guys were awesome this morning singing. Thank you for doing that. You're amazing. But now, thank you. Don't clap for me. I didn't I didn't do any of that. Just wait till after the sermon, see what you think. But the reason I'm holding this up for a couple of reasons. First of all, a denarius was about the size of this coin. I think it was the same color. It was a silver coin and it was it was the acceptable payment for the tax that we're talking about. So brilliant move. Number one, Jesus doesn't have one. You notice that? So pretty quick way to endear yourself to the people when you go tell you what, does anybody have a denarius and let the Pharisees and the Herodians produce one? So he so he he holds one up and he and the text tells us he looks at it and he asks the question. And the question he asks is a question that we could ask about this dime right here. Whose picture is on it? Do you guys know whose picture is on the dime? Roosevelt, all right, FDR is the correct answer. I'll just pretend all of you knew that just to kind of keep this going, because everybody in Jerusalem knew whose portrait was on the denarius. They answer it's Caesar. Caesar's picture is on there. And not only that, but there's an inscription. There are words just like there are words on this. I'm not going to try to read because I can't I can't I can't get that focal point right anymore. But there are words on this well that if you pulled out a dime or a quarter or a penny, kids, you can do this at home. Look at any coin and you'll notice someone's pictures on it and there are words on it. OK, so Jesus is telling them something they already know. But the words that are on this coin are something that he doesn't state, but they would have known as well. The words on the denarius not only featured Caesar's face, but it featured these words, Tiberius Caesar Augustus, son of the divine Augustus. OK, so on your dime, it says in God we trust on the denarius, it said in Caesar we trust. Because Caesar was considered divine, this was the whole cult of imperial worship that members, that citizens of the Roman Empire were were expected to give their undying, unwavering loyalty, even their worship to Caesar because he was considered divine, he was considered someone worthy of worship. And there was an exchange going on here, right? Like if you worship Caesar and you dedicated everything to him and he held your highest loyalty, he would provide for you and he would protect you and he would give you all the benefits of his kingdom. Now, no wonder the zealots wouldn't even carry a denarius in their pocket. Because this was a mobile, mass produced propaganda machine for the empire. Now, we don't really pay that much attention to what our coins say, I don't think. You have no problem carrying coins around if you use them anymore anyway, but you know, you have them in a jar somewhere, you don't really think about what they say, they don't really make demands on your heart in any significant way, but symbolically this helps us understand the choice Jesus is putting in front of us because there are things in your life that demand your loyalty in exchange for services. I mean, we can think even just sort of on a benign level of the way in which our workout regimes and our diets, if we devote ourselves to them and when you hear people talking about them with religious fervor, you know they're evangelizing you, why? Because if you do it, you will get the body you want. Now, in your career, I'm sure someone along the way has given you the pep talk to say, look, if you want to make it, if you want the job you want that in the salary band you want, you're going to have to dedicate yourself, you're going to have to pay your dues. Here we are in Washington DC, it's safe to say that oftentimes we talk about our political affiliations and organizations this way that if we just dedicate ourselves to the cause, we will get the country we want. And while there's nothing wrong with committing ourselves to the institutions and the communities that shape us and that we believe in, there's nothing wrong with that at all, in fact we'll talk about that in just a moment, there is a fine line between loyalty and idolatry. Between working hard for the communities and institutions we're part of and placing all of our hope there. So you would think that Jesus would very quickly dismiss any idea that we should pay taxes, I mean if it's that offensive simply to look at a coin, you might think Jesus' answer would be, well no, then don't, or at least a very hesitant, qualified, okay fine. Which is basically the way the Pharisees came out, the Pharisees understood that the Roman government offered certain protections for them and kept them in power to a certain degree like they needed them, but they also let people know they didn't like it. So their answer about taxes would be like, sure, yes, but we don't like it. But we don't like it. And Jesus could have at least kind of landed there, but instead, Jesus doesn't really answer the question, does he? I mean, he does, but then he raises another question entirely. So let's talk about that second option. If there's warnings here against tying our highest allegiance to Caesar, there's also blessings that are extended to us here of having our loyalties lie with our Creator. Notice what Jesus does say. He looks at the denarius in verse 15 and verse 16, he asks a question whose likeness is here, they say it's Caesar's, and then Jesus says this, verse 17, render or give to Caesar the things that are Caesar's and to God the things that are God's. Remember, he's just talking about the likeness, so he's saying, look, if this coin has Caesar's image on it, give it to him. And give to God that which bears his image. And when he said that, we're told the people marveled. We can imagine why the Pharisees and Herodians marveled, they're like, so close, like how in the world did he just get out of that? It's a good answer. And then other people, we know Jesus had a pretty big fan club. I mean the Jesus show was in town and so people were gathering around and he does not disappoint. But I have to think there are other people who marveled at what Jesus actually said. And specifically what he said about how much they were worth. Look, Jesus doesn't do chapter and verse here, he doesn't say open your Bibles please to Genesis chapter 1. But that's what he's talking about. He's going all the way back to the beginning of the Bible, he's going all the way back to Genesis chapter 1, that story of how God made all things out of nothing, including human beings, male and female. And then in verse 27 of chapter 1, we read that God created human beings in his likeness, in his image. As if to say, you and I who bear his image have more value than we could possibly realize. I find that the church in having conversations about the value of human beings often skips Genesis 1 in favor of Genesis 3. Now don't hear what I'm not saying, both are important parts of the discussion, okay? But we often skip over the majesty of creation in order just to get right to the tragedy of sin. But that's not where Jesus starts in this conversation, he starts with Genesis 1, he starts with the fact that all human beings are made in the image of their creator and therefore are endowed with dignity and worth and value. All of them, including, ladies and gentlemen, you. You know, often we just kind of live in a Genesis 3 mindset, we walk into a room like this and all we can think about is just how terrible we are. How far we've fallen, how much we've failed, and we forget that behind Genesis 3 is Genesis 1, that God created you in his image, that you are valuable, that you are the masterpiece, the pinnacle of his creation. And we should marvel at that. The psalmist marvels at that, Psalm 139. The psalmist marvels at that, Psalm 139. He praises God that he is fearfully and wonderfully made. When was the last time you thought about being fearfully and wonderfully made instead of being really misshapen and out of shape? That's where we go when we look in the mirror, it's like, oh boy, all right. Or we walk into a room, we walk into a party, we walk into a meeting, we know we gotta do the meet and greet, we know where this conversation is going. We ask what you do, and how long you've been there, and insinuated is how much you make, and where you went to school, and you play that whole game, and everybody's just kind of doing this, measuring each other up, and who knows who, and all of that. It's easy to think in those contexts, I am worth what I do. That's my worth, what I do. Jesus is saying, you are worth so much more, you are made in the image of God. We can even walk into church and begin to size ourselves up, thinking, I'm worth how I did this week, how little I sinned, how much I obeyed, how many times I opened my Bible. Whoops, this is the first time I've opened my Bible since, let me see, last Sunday. Jesus, fully aware of Genesis 3, we'll talk about that in a second, starts in Genesis 1. So that we would understand how much we're worth, and not just how much we're worth, but how much everybody we meet is worth. Just to riff on C.S. Lewis a little bit, it's not exactly what he says, but he's getting at it when he says, you have never met someone who does not bear the image of God. The people you live with, believe it or not, the people you zoom by in the right lane, and give a dirty look, because they're going too slow, they're going 66. It's a 65, you can go 80, right, like you give them that look, like, what are you doing? Get out of my way, I got places to be. The people who bag your groceries, or probably help you bag your own groceries because the self-checkout thing isn't working, made in the image of God. The people who are suffering in Syria and Turkey right now after the earthquake, made in the image of God. Worth so much. Jesus is not reminiscing about the way humanity used to be in a garden far, far away. He is talking about now. And this is why James, in James chapter 3, in the New Testament, James chapter 3 verse 9 says this. With our tongues, with our words, we bless our Lord and Father, so we come into church and we sing praise, how great thou art, and with that same mouth we curse people who are made in the likeness of God. Not the people on the internet. Wrong. The people behind those comments that you're commenting on, made in the image of God. The people who are our opponents, our enemies, made in the image of God. Do I need to go on? No. So Jesus tells us how much you're worth, and in the same breath, he tells us how much we owe. So just follow the logic. He says, alright, here's the coin, it's got Caesar's face on it, give it to Caesar, it belongs to him. And give to God what bears his image. So how much do you owe? As I was going through my forms this week and making my stack, preparing to file my taxes, I saw my 1040 from last year, and I was just kind of looking through it. And in big bold letters, it says something, actually I'll ask you, if you're a CPA I'll make your year, okay? What is line 37 on 1040? That is where you put the amount you owe. Alright, so when you're doing your taxes this year, you get to line 37, you're like, oh boy. Think of this sermon, and you're just going to feel better. You're just going to feel better about yourself and the world. But it just struck me, like, that is what Jesus is bringing us to. He's bringing us through all the math to line 37 when it comes to our relationship with God. What is the amount you owe? Some of you have never asked that question before in your life. Because the underlying assumption is that actually it's God who should be filing the 1040 for you. Like, he owes you an explanation for the hardship in your life. He owes you the relationship that you long for but don't have. He owes you the relationship that you long for but don't have. He owes you, like, he's on the hook. And I can understand that, because even those of us who have been Christians for a long time sometimes feel that sense of entitlement. Like, God, I've given everything to you, I'm getting nothing back. So if that's where you are, we should talk about that offline, because that's a real feeling many of us have. But that's not the question Jesus is asking here. He's asking you and me to fill in that line, to give to God what is God's. And the question he doesn't fully answer that you have to answer for yourself this morning is, how much is that? I know what Jesus' answer is. What's your answer to that question? And now, once you have the answer to how much you owe, the question is, how much are you really giving? What are you holding back? By the way, part of what makes this so brilliant is the fact that Caesar is not exempt from this question. You see, the delegation is trying to trap Jesus in an either-or situation. It's either Caesar or it's your creator. And Jesus says, no, actually, it's a both-hand. You just have to have the order right. Because even as he's holding up the denarius, he's saying, yeah, give to Caesar what's Caesar's. The fact is, Caesar is a creature as well, made in the image of God. And so, Caesar doesn't own you, God owns you. Now, on one hand, this may make you think, well, then as a Christian, my relationship to authority is really confusing. Because I'm kind of walking around, and I have supervisors and managers and kids. You have teachers and coaches, and we have the government. And if you're in the military, you've got a chain of command. And when you think of it this way, like, well, I owe my highest allegiance to God, your attitude, you might think, would be something like, I don't have to owe anything to God. And when you think of it this way, like, well, I owe my highest allegiance to God, your attitude, you might think, would be something like, I don't have to listen to what anyone else has to say. I answer to God. But notice what Jesus is doing. He's actually giving us a framework to obey and submit to authority in our life, out of love and worship of God. It's what Paul does in Romans chapter 13 as well. He says, the authorities in our lives are placed in our lives by God himself, that we might obey them, serve them, submit to them out of love and obedience to the one who is truly in authority. And this frees us up, actually, to not make idols of the authority in our lives, and at the same time, to serve in a way that would glorify God. That we would say, I want to honor God in the way that I submit to those who are in authority over me. We were talking about this passage this past week, and Rob Yancey, our pastor at Fairfax, mentioned, he said, you know, I think I've found in my conversations with people in my congregation that it's actually this framework that helps us be better teachers and lawyers and doctors and engineers. It's this framework that allows us to say, I answer finally to God. And yet, that allows me, liberates me to work, to serve, to live out of gratitude and love and joy. And so, thinking about how much we owe. Again, Jesus doesn't answer this question completely, and yet he leaves it for us this morning to answer. Not only as the one who has made us, but as the one who later in this same week will die for us. You know, 30 years before this, there was Judas the Galilean who took up arms in order to push back against the Roman Empire. And later in this same week that we're reading about, Jesus, another Galilean, would spread out his arms on a cross to pay for our sins, the debt we owe, and could not pay back. How much do we owe him? How much are you giving him? Our gracious Heavenly Father, we thank you for your grace that you have shown us in Jesus. Lord, we remember the words of the hymn. The drops of grief cannot repay the debt of love I owe. Here, Lord, I give myself away. It is all that I can do. It is all that I can do. Lord, help us by your grace, by your power, to give ourselves away. We ask in Christ's name. Amen.
