Good morning. My name is Austin Kettle and I'm part of the pastoral staff here at McLean Press. Do keep Psalm 88 open in front of you if you can. There are Bibles in your pews, it's on page 494 if you need that. Before we jump in, let's pray. Empty us. Empty us merciful and mighty God of all that prevents us from hearing what you want us to hear this morning. Empty us of our preconceptions, our preoccupations, and our prejudices. Empty us that we might be filled with your spirit and your word. Empty us that we might be filled for your ministry and mission. In Christ's name, amen. If you never had an emo phase, you missed out. You've got to face pain and name suffering and see it in yourself at some point in your life. And for most of that, that's when we're teenagers. You go through this phase, it's part of growing up, and for some it's a Nirvana stage. I asked the high schoolers this week if that's still a thing, and they said, well, you know, some kids still wear the t-shirts, but they don't really know who the band is. But if you went through a Nirvana stage, or if like Pastor Timo at Reston, you're still in one, you know that what they did was they took incredibly simple music and filled it with angst and tension, and that was successful. It spoke something that needed saying. Whether or not you like Nirvana is up to you. That's fine. The Verve, Bittersweet Symphony, best song of 1997. We can talk about it. And about halfway through, Richard Ashcroft, the lead singer, sings this line that just tells us so much of what we're looking for when we go to music to see our souls. He says this, I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me. That was all the 1990s. What did you expect? But in our cultural moment, we're revisiting the 90s, right? I mean, that's just what we're doing. And depression and alienation are themes that are everywhere for us culturally. And if you're a pop artist especially, if you're not engaging those themes, you're faking it. Who even are you if you're not talking about those things? They're the deep things, the things that people feel they need to talk about. And there's something truthful to recognize in this, that the most powerful art, not just in the 90s, not just today, but through the centuries, has often gone to this place. Taxi driver, the deer hunter, catcher in the rye, the bell jar. Which part of Dante's Inferno do we remember? Of the Divine Comedy, it's Inferno, I mixed it up. We think about the Inferno, I did it just right then. I don't think about paradise, because what changed the world was the way he talked about hell. God does this. It helps us to give words and form to the torture of the soul. We talked last week about how the psalms are the songbook of God's people. And around 40% of the psalms in this book are psalms of lament, songs that teach us to hurt well. It is a songbook that is not lacking compared to the songs of the world, that is not afraid to go to those deep and dark places that we might not expect God's word to go to. A songbook that can teach us the things we feel. And none go darker than this psalm, the darkness psalm, Psalm 88. It is the low point of the whole book, the darkest place. This morning we're going to do three things. First, we're going to look at the anatomy of the psalm, get our heads around it. Once we've done that, we're going to ask ourselves the questions that it asks. And then thirdly, we're going to ask what it means that Jesus sang this psalm. So let's look at the psalm first. I just called it the darkness psalm. There's a reason for that, it kind of breaks down into three sections, and each one is defined by an image of darkness. We get this kind of feeling of descent, that we're going down and down and down, and whenever our head might come up, we go down again. And why three times? Well, there's a common structure to lots of laments psalms. There's so many of them that we can see a pattern that is not universal, but it is general. Most laments psalms go like this, they go, protest, God, what is going on? Plea, God, fix it. Praise, you are mighty. Protest, plea, praise. Three-part structure of a lament. And you see the kind of, the attempt of that in Psalm 88. There's a protest in verses one to nine, there's a plea in the face of it. And if you look at 13, you can see that he tries to come to a place of praise. I, O Lord, cry to you in the morning, my prayer comes before you, but he can't make it. God himself is the problem. If you look at it, he says, you cast my soul away, you hide, I suffer your terrors, your wrath, your assaults, you, God, are the problem. The darkest language gives us these three sections. The first one ends with my eyes growing dim at the beginning of verse nine, physical darkness. Then in verse 12, we get the darkness in the land of forgetfulness, compounded darkness. And we come to the third place at the end of verse 18, my companions have become darkness. And the original translates a little bit more like this, my companions, darkness. Darkness is my only friend. The logic runs like this, verses one to nine, you have cut me off, here I am, isolated, no hope, cut off, a horror to those who see me and forgotten by those who don't. 10 to 12, why have you done this? It brings you no glory, there is no goodness in this, there is no silver lining, no meaning, no purpose, no praise to your name that comes from this. Why? And 13 to 18, God, you have ruined my life and you are not listening. You see this written in the Bible and you've got to ask, have you asked those questions? For some of those, those questions will gnaw at our souls when we wake in the morning and we'll suppress or we'll indulge or whatever we'll do. For others of us, we see it in people we care about, people we love and we wish we could put a Bible verse on it and fix it and make it go away. The psalmist asked these three questions and God says nothing. It ends. Except that God does say something. If you've got your Bible open, look at the text before the psalm begins. God says in the face of this completely unpolished, unfinished prayer, he says, that's my boy. That's my boy. Him and the Ezraite put his name on it, put it in my Bible, name him and show that this boy that I loved prayed this prayer and I said, good, give it to my people. They will need this. Credit my dear child, show them how I love them in the middle of the worst of it all. God put this psalm in the Bible to give us language to thump his chest and yell at him and say, God, how and why and what? He gives you Psalm 88 to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in the darkest moments of life, to teach you the geography of your emotions when you can't see in front of your face. We've got a sketch of the anatomy of the psalm and it is darkness. Let's ask ourselves the questions it raises. I think the first question we have to ask when we read something like this in the scriptures is, are we able to pray like this ourselves? Do we allow ourselves to come before God with this degree of honesty? Have you believed that he will hear this and stay, that he won't leave? That when you can't or you won't polish up your prayers, he listens, he loves you, he honors them and treasures them. Are you ready to talk to God like this yourself? And then whether or not you are, are we ready together to hear these prayers? Are we a church family where we can hear someone say this and not scramble to stop it, but hear it and honor it and treasure it? Is there space in our community groups and in our friendships? Is there space around our mops tables, our round tables, our nursery tables, through all the stages of the life of the church to let people bang the table and say this is darkness, this is not good, I will not call darkness light. I won't pretend that this is okay. I won't pretend that when God closes a door, he opens a window, there's a silver lining to everything, that this must work together for my good. Do we have room to sit with one another in this, to hear these kinds of prayers? If we're just a community, if we're just another interest group or club, then this will destroy our ideology. This would be a threat to the system of theories that we have built up and told each other to believe. This kind of prayer is a threat to a system that does not have at its center a living and loving God who is big enough and strong enough to take the banging on his chest and hug you close. He's strong enough to take all our pain and if this is true, we can call broken and evil and dark things what they are and we can ask without a prepared answer, why God? If you are who you say you are, those three questions, how could you let this happen? If you are God, what are you doing? Why have you done this? You can pretend that those questions don't exist. You can pretend that knowing God is always encouraging and nothing else. But if you do, you're not living biblical Christianity. Biblical Christianity carves out room for rage. The Lord gives this to us as part of the faith he calls us into. This is the Bible of Jacob's all-night wrestle with God, the Bible of the Garden of Gethsemane, the Bible of exile and tears and grief and weeping, the Bible of the death of Lazarus where Jesus himself cannot bear to lose his close friend. The Bible gives us language and permission to bring these realities face to face with God himself, not to hide them, to polish them, to prepare them, but to bring them. So in that moment when it's not us, but someone we love because Christ loves them, someone we love for whatever reason it is, what do we do? Well first we don't try to fix it. God lets this psalm sit. We sit in it. We so often rather kind of soothe ourselves by fixing the problem and have our world go back to where it was, make our world happy again than sit in what really is, call it what it is and let people experience that. And as you sit in it, we're so tempted to jump to a story, right? To tell you, oh, you're suffering through this. Let me tell you about my, let me tell you about someone I know. Stop. The psalm doesn't jump to the stories of redemption that it could do. They're there. They're in the Bible. But in that moment, that is not it. Some of us will be tempted to jump to laughter, to food, to adventures, to expeditions, to productivity, to all these things. And these are good things. They're wonderful things to bring into the lives of one another when we're faced with hardship, but not right now. Not in the moment. We're not given this psalm just to short circuit it, just to read it and move on. It teaches us at least two things. Firstly, that faced with deep soul-wrenching suffering and death and pain, we don't have to act like it's not so. We don't have to square off the pain and resolve it immediately and by the end of the day, have it fixed. And then it teaches us that we can't possibly. These things are too deep. We can't put a Band-Aid and carry on. So what can we do? What can we do? In the face of the pit, of the descent, of being a horror. The psalm teaches us two things. Turn to God and cry out. And cry out as it actually is. They seem so obvious, don't they? But turn to God. Don't neglect to pray. In those moments, sure, we want to sit, but we must pray. If we believe that this is not a set of ideologies and theories that we built up and told one another to believe, but a living God, then in these darkest moments, we get to cry out to him. We don't want to stick a neat Bible verse on and move along, but what would we be doing if we didn't pray? We pray for, but we pray with. Pray with one another in the moment. Cry out to the Lord together. Pauses are fine. Start out not knowing where you're going to end. That's okay. Don't forget to turn to God. In it. God of my salvation. Nothing else in this prayer is polished. There is no end. But he prays. And cry out as it is. Call things what they feel like. Call out the promises of God. Ask him to keep them. Beg that he would keep them. Trust in resurrection hope. Dare to ask for some of it now. Of course. Don't be ashamed. Cry out. He loves to hear our prayers. He treasures them so much that he would do this. We thought about a psalm. We thought about asking ourselves the questions. Let's think about what it means that Jesus sang this psalm. We're living through a genuinely baffling historic moment. I don't know if you noticed. A few years ago we were talking about deep fakes. More recently it's ChatGPT and AI. Some of you guys really know what that's about and some of us are just threatened. I've had people suggest that I write sermons by ChatGPT. It may be better. You decide. But the right to strike out in Hollywood has raised loads of philosophical questions, hasn't it? Does it matter if our stories are written by humans? Will they be true? If they are, if they're not. If they're written by bots and all this kind of thing. Can AI just tell better stories than we even can? Should we just hand it over to them? Let them go? Does it matter? Well, I hope you see that in some things AI is a great gift. Let's use it. But if I were to write this sermon with AI, I hope you would see a problem. That for some things authorship matters deeply. It's not in everything. But it does matter in some things. Like the hymn that we're going to sing after this sermon. It was written by a man called William Cooper. Looks like Cowper. It's Cooper. He wrote it in 1779 and William Cooper had a life full of chronic depression. He made at least three suicide attempts. He felt deep grief in his soul over that. Such guilt around it among everything else. And in the course of his life he was befriended by a man called John Newton. The man who wrote Amazing Grace. And as Cooper got older and shared some of the hymns that he wrote in reflection on his wrestling and his struggling and his moments of darkness with the Lord. Newton asked him if he could publish some in a book together with his. He saw the depth of truth in what Cooper wrote. How hard won it was. And asked him, can we do this together? Can we give this as a gift to God's people? So when you sing in a moment, heal us Emmanuel. Deep wounded souls to you we cry. Hear the authorship. Hear that that is coming from William Cooper, your brother in Christ. As a gift. From the darkness. Authorship matters. But hold on. We'll sing that in a minute but I want us to pick up an even more precious thought before we sing that. Because we've got to ask, who wrote the Psalms? If authorship matters, who wrote the Psalms? We've already said that Heman, the Ezra Heights wrote Psalm 88. But the Spirit of the Lord was upon him. And we can talk later about doctrine of scripture but we believe that this was written by Heman and it was written by the Spirit of God. That he inspired Heman to write this. That God the Father blessed what the Spirit wrote and Christ sang it. You have it in your Bible. That the Holy Spirit inspired this. God the Father said, yes, put it in. That is true. My people need that. But don't miss the second person of the Trinity. That he sang this. There's a pastor, James Adams, who says this. The Spirit of Christ was in the Psalmists, speaking through them centuries before he came to earth as the long-awaited Messiah. The I, the author of the Psalms, is Christ himself. His is the great voice we hear in the Psalms, crying out in prayer to God the Father. The Psalms are the prayers and the songs of Jesus, given to his body, to his bride, to us, to sing as he has done, as he does. The Bible is so clear on it that in Hebrews 2 the author quotes a Psalm that is not quoted by Jesus in any of the Gospels and says, these are the words of Jesus. Why does it matter? It matters because these are words that were fulfilled in their deepest sense by the singing of Jesus. That as he said these words, for all of us, we may experience parts of this, we may come close to parts of Psalm 88, but for all of us, some of it will be exaggeration. Some of it will be hyperbole. Some of it won't actually be fully real, and yet for Christ, every single detail is literal. That his friends considered him a horror. One friend sold him to death. Another, the very best of them, denied him in the moment of need. That the people whom he loved would whip him and torture him and nail him to a cross. That they would watch him bleed out and laugh and play games as he did. That he would be separated, not only losing his earthly father Joseph, but losing his heavenly father. Cut off among the dead. That he would be set free among the dead with no hope. That none of this is exaggeration in the soul of Christ. That every depth of pain we come to has been lived into, entered into, and ultimately conquered, but first endured by the Lord Jesus Christ. There's no depth of our emotion, no ocean floor of grief that he has on us. There's no depth of our emotion, no ocean floor of grief that he has not gone to and felt and mapped. And in the face of the things we face in this life, we need a gospel that can stand up to the world. Can stand up in the things we see. At least as well as the other songs we hear. In Rio de Janeiro you have Christ the Redeemer standing on top of Cocovado Mountain, 98 feet tall, 26 feet wide, made of concrete and sandstone, staring down. And we can look up in awe, but that is not a God who feels the pain in our gut. The grief and the loss. The knowledge of self. In his might, he's not enough. But nor is it good enough to have a cardboard cutout Jesus in the corner of the room, who we curtsy to but then can't take it if we lean on his shoulder and definitely couldn't take it if we punched him in the gut. We need who Christ is. A Christ who is mighty and is present. Who does love. Who does feel. Who will walk into the darkest corners with us and waits with us. Who gives us songs and words to express the pain that we don't understand, to diagnose it, to teach us what it is, to offer real hope. We need a God who won't be disgusted at us when we can't give him the answer that we think he wants. So knowing how these songs have been sung with complete conviction by Christ changes how we hear them. A song changes when someone sings it, right? Johnny Cash sang the song Hurt by Nine Inch Nails towards the end of his life. And a song that meant something took on such depth, knowing what he had done and walked through. It's one of the most watched videos on YouTube these days because it resonates so deeply. This man with this song. And let me tell you, this song with this man is true. And it is yours. As Christ sings this, Christ dignifies you. He calls you up into the likeness of God in your lost, loosed among the dead, soul full of troubles, broken, helpless self. And the Father says through the tears of the Son, that's my girl. As you beat his chest, he says, that's my boy. I put this here for you. I am the God of your salvation. Cry out, it's not over. And so we learn to suffer from Jesus. Sing the songs he gives you. It's not wrestling if you're not trying to win. Pound on your father's chest and don't hold back. He's strong enough to stand it. He has covenanted it in the blood of his Son to stay through it and he invites you to do it. And listen to the unsanitized songs of others. Be unshockable as sinners in a broken world with a mighty God. He has told us what we are like. Don't be surprised. Honor one another with the truth. And honor one another in those moments with this. It is not over. Resolution has not come yet. Yes, it will. But it's not here yet. And listen and hear Jesus sing. He didn't only face the grave, he went down into it. He didn't only glimpse the darkness, but he went into it and conquered it. He didn't look at wrath and evil and shrug. But he took all that shunning. He sang the words of Psalm 88 so that you could look down at Psalm 99 and say, though I am in 88 right now, one day I will sing. I will sing of the steadfast love of the Lord forever and with my mouth I will make known his faithfulness to all generations. Blessed be the Lord forever. Blessed be the Lord forever. He has bought those words for the people who are in Psalm 88 right now. Frederick Buechner says that the resurrection means that the worst thing is never the last thing. Another commentator says of Psalm 88 that the power of his accusation is the power of its hope. In the depths of the accusation, the fact that it can be made to the God of my salvation who lives and loves, speaks hope before we can speak it ourselves. The day will come. Let me finish with these words from one of our former Capital Fellows, songwriter Delaney Young. Come and wrestle with me, my beloved, to the other side of the night. You'll see that mercy soon will bind your wounds and bring you back to life. Child, there is mercy in my wounds. I won't leave you, I refuse. As healing from these bruises, I have good things for you. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we praise you that you know us better than we know ourselves. You love us through every season and every depth. Please, draw us to yourself. Draw us to one another to love each other and to love the lost as you have loved us. We praise you. In Jesus' name, amen.
