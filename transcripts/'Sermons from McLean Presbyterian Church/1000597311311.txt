Good morning. My name is Ryan, I'm one of the pastors here. It's my privilege to open up to Mark chapter 10 with you. If you have your Bibles open, find Mark chapter 10. If you need to use one of the Pew Bibles, go for it. If you have your phone device with a Bible on there, I'd encourage you to have a copy of God's word in front of you as we work through this passage together. If you've been with us the last couple weeks, then you've probably been keeping track of Jesus hitting all the hot topics in a short amount of time. So two weeks ago, we talked about, or Jesus addressed the topic of hell with us. Last week, the topic of divorce. This week, the topic of money, which makes you wonder, is he picking on you a little bit? Or maybe he's picking on me a little bit. Or maybe he's picking on this poor young man who comes to Jesus with a question just a little bit. He's a likable enough guy. He bears resemblance to some of us in this room for a number of reasons. He asks an earnest and honest question and Jesus lets him have it. Now, to be fair, Jesus isn't just looking for a rich person to pick on. This man comes with a question. And that question, by the way, is worth the price of admission this morning. I don't know how much he paid coming in, but it's worth it. This is a great question. It's flawed in its own way, but the general idea of situating your life on the timeline of eternity is a good exercise. And it's one that we don't often engage in because most of us, let's be honest, most of us, even right now, you're thinking about what's happening later today. You may have already searched where everybody's going for lunch. It's okay, it's all right. I'm not gonna check your phone, but it could be that. You may have already looked at your calendar and been like, oh man, that's right, I've gotta do that thing. Or you just remembered that you have a pre-calc test on Tuesday and you're not ready. I mean, who's ready for that? No one's ready for that. You've got a presentation on Wednesday, the clients aren't happy, you're not prepared, you're just trying not to think about it, but you know that's what you're doing for the rest of the day and the rest of the week. Or maybe some of you are planners and you just realized I've gotta get the kids registered for summer camp. If you haven't already, it's probably too late if that makes you feel any better. But you know, that's about as far as we go. Some of you are like, can I make it through this sermon? That would be an accomplishment for the day. Can I make it through? And you know, because we just don't think of eternity stretching out in front of us. It's just not a daily function. It's not the perspective that we have. And yet here we have this young man who we're told by the other gospel writers was a respected member of society. That's why we often call him the rich young ruler. There's no mention of him being a ruler here, but Luke mentions it. He was a ruler probably of a synagogue and that meant he had schedules to keep and he had to manage people and he had to keep everything on budget and he had money problems and people problems and all the problems you have that get you caught up in the tyranny of the urgent. And yet he's able for this moment with Jesus to step out of that and ask Jesus a question. Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life? And this morning what I wanna do is consider Jesus's answer to that question and then also Jesus's response to Peter's follow-up question. Do you see that? It's the conversation with the rich young ruler and then there's this wonderful exchange when Peter has a follow-up question or kind of statement, question in the form of a statement and Jesus responds to that too. But both of Jesus's conversations are helping us answer this all important question of what it means to have eternity stretch out in front of us and what it means today in the present, in the present to have assurance that eternal life with God is something we will inherit. So let me pray for us and then we'll jump into this text. Father, we thank you that you have given us your word and put your word in our hearts and before us this morning we thank you that we live in the shadow of your wing, that you look at us and that you love us. And so we pray that we would receive these words that are before us today as the words that come from the one who knows us the best and loves us the most. We pray in Jesus's name, amen. All right, this man asks a fairly straightforward question. Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life? It's a question, straightforward question that some of our kids downstairs in Sunday school could answer for you in a very straightforward way. But Jesus does not answer this straightforward question in a straightforward way, does he? He goes all over the place. He begins with this pedantic comment about the definition of the word good. Why is that there? And then he talks about some of the 10 commandments but not all of the 10 commandments. And then he levels this young man with a radical call to sell everything, give it to the poor and follow Jesus. When it seems like the most loving thing to do would just be to answer this question in a straightforward way, but we're assured by Mark that Jesus knows what he's doing. In verse 21, in the middle of this conversation with this young man, Mark tells us that Jesus looked at him, you see that? He looked at him and he loved him. He looked at him and loved him. Now, the verb to look there is not as bland as it sounds. Okay, it's not, it's not, it's not just like a blank look, like, all right, finish what you're saying so I can start what I'm saying. It's not angry, it's not furrowed browed, angry. He looks at him, the word there is actually to look intently, to examine, to scrutinize, to look into this man, that is to say, Jesus looks at this man and he assesses who he is, what he's about, what makes him tick and where he has pinned his hope for eternal life. He figures all that out in a moment and even as he is assessing this man and scrutinizing him in this way, Jesus loves him. And so, we have to understand that his answer and the way he goes about his answer comes from the one who knows us the best and loves us, loves us the most. And interestingly, that same word for look shows up in verse 27 in the second conversation I want to look at. Jesus looks at his disciples and we know he knows his disciples inside and out and so his answer to them is also one that comes from a place of love. And that answer comes to us this morning in the same way. It's Jesus speaking to us about eternal life because he knows us and because he loves us. So, what I want to do this morning is I want to consider the two options that are behind these two conversations. So, the rich young ruler is coming to Jesus with an assumption. He's assuming that he can do enough to inherit eternal life. And Peter, in his own way, is assuming that he can give enough to inherit eternal life. Do enough or give enough. These are the options that are presented to us and Jesus, because he knows us and he loves us, sees those same underlying assumptions in our own hearts and gently but firmly dismantles both of them in order to give us the good news of the gospel. Beginning with the first one, Jesus talks to this rich young ruler about his assumption that he can do enough. There is a lot. I know that he is sometimes held up as a poster boy of how not to live in churches. Maybe that's the sermon you've heard on the rich young ruler all the time, but let's at least admire some things about this guy. First of all, he's sincere. At least he seems to be. We've been working with Pharisees who have been testing Jesus with their questions, but he doesn't seem to be testing Jesus at all. He seems to be earnest, honest, authentic, sincere. You know, put your adjective on it, but he comes running up to Jesus. He kneels before Jesus. He shows respect to Jesus and refers to Jesus as a good teacher. He seems to really want to know the answer to this question. But he's not just sincere, he's also moral. Jesus does have this short conversation with him, at least in a sentence, why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. And this has, as you can imagine, generated a lot of discussion among theologians as to why Jesus would say something like this. And the sum of it is this. Jesus is not so much correcting this man's understanding of who Jesus is, because he's kind of on the right track there. What he's really correcting is this man's definition of good. This man's definition of good. And as we see, he's working with a much lower bar than he ought to be. So Jesus goes on to say, well, look, you know the commandments, just do those, you'll be fine. And the man responds, teacher, all these I have kept from youth. And maybe we don't like him so much anymore. Like, you know, he came off as sincere, but maybe he's a little arrogant. But then again, you know, we talk this way, men talk this way about each other. And so one of the favorite ways that men talk about each other is you're a good guy. He's a good guy. And what do we mean by that? Well, you know, we're not working with highly specialized moral categories when we say that, all right? What we mean is he helped me move last week. Like he let me borrow his truck and he helped me move my couch last week. He's a good guy. Or, you know, I know that he helps out with the girls, with his daughter's softball team or his kid's soccer team, he's a good guy. He works hard, he has a good job. You know, he's polite, he's nice. You know, he does the dishes when we're at his house and they're doing, you know, we're having dinner. Like he's a good guy. It's kind of the way that as Americans, we talk about goodness or morality. If you were to stop someone on the street or maybe even stop someone after church and say, are you a good person? All right, and you know, just nuance this a little bit, but generally speaking, if you ask someone on the street or someone you know, or maybe someone around, are you a good person? What they're gonna say is, well, I'm not perfect. And you say, well, no one's perfect. Well, right, okay, we established that. No one's perfect, but I'm good. Like, you know, and let's just take this list. I haven't murdered anybody. I haven't committed adultery. I haven't stolen. You know, I haven't set up like a Ponzi scheme and defrauded people of hundreds of thousands of dollars. You know, I haven't lied under oath in court. I'm nice enough to my parents, right? I call my mom on Mother's Day, right? So, yeah, I'm a good guy. I try to be, I try to be a good person. Would you agree that's generally the way people measure themselves? Good, good person, moral person. And that's all this man is saying. Now, he's probably raised the bar a little higher than that. He's a devout Jew, so he really is measuring himself against an objective standards, which most Americans don't. But, you know, measuring themselves against an objective standard. He says, yeah, I'm a good guy. Now, but here's the question I would have for him. This isn't the question Jesus asks exactly, but this is the question that's prompted in my head. If he's so confident that he aces the Ten Commandments test every single day, why is he asking Jesus this question? If he's so confident that he's done enough to inherit eternal life, why is he now asking Jesus to grade his test? Is he just desperate for approval? Is his love language words of affirmation? And he thinks Jesus might give some words of affirmation. Does he just want to hear Jesus say it in front of everybody else? Or could it be that down deep, there's this gnawing question that bothers him, even at a young age? What if I haven't done enough? Like, what if I haven't done enough? What if I haven't been good, moral, religious enough to make God happy with me in order to inherit eternal life? Now again, just to kind of get into our American mindset, our American mindset would say what Jesus should say at that moment when this man is having guilt feelings. Jesus should say, no, no, no, no, no. Young man, you are being way too hard on yourself. You are fine just the way you are. You just keep doing what you do. Be in who you are. Try to bring joy into the world, right? Like, that's sort of the American response to this existential crisis. But Jesus doesn't play that game, does he? Instead, Jesus lowers the hammer. And he says, okay, sounds like you got some of the commandments under control. You apparently haven't heard the Sermon on the Mount. You might wanna download those sermons just to make sure you understand what those are. But there's one thing you lack, he says. There's one thing, just one. Sell everything, give it to the poor. You'll have treasure in heaven and then come follow me. That's all. What is going on with that? Now, we know Jesus is not making a universal command that everyone who follows him must take a vow of poverty because there are plenty of rich people who follow Jesus around and stay rich the whole time they're around Jesus. But Jesus knows this man and he loves him and so he says the one thing he needs to hear so that it gets through that he really hasn't done enough. The late theologian R.C. Sproul calls this the old switcheroo. That's not what he calls it, but that's the technical theological term for what's happening here. This is the old switcheroo, all right? Notice the commands that Jesus cites. They seem kind of haphazard, but actually they all come from the second part of the Ten Commandments. And we know that the Ten Commandments is broken up into the first five, which are about our relationship with God, and then the second five, which are about our relationship with people. Jesus is citing all of those commands and how are you doing with those? And the man says, I think A plus, if I can say that, A plus on those, and then Jesus says, great. Let's just then go back to the first command, which is you shall have no other gods before me and how are we doing with that one? See, that's what he's getting at with this question. He's saying because he knows him, you may think you've obeyed all these commands. We can come back to that later. You haven't even obeyed the first. Because for you, money is God. And we know that because of the way the man responds. Disheartened, verse 22. Sorrowful, he walks away, why? Because he had great possessions, because he was loaded. And he realized, well, that's my security. I mean, that's, my money's how I know I'm gonna be taken care of tomorrow. That's my significance. That's how I know that I'm worth something in the world. That's my freedom. That's how I am able to do all the things that I wanna do in the world. That's my life. Like, I'm sorry, no? And for him, it's money, but it doesn't necessarily have to be money. There are lots of things this world offers us that we put on the throne of our lives and we orient our lives around something besides God which functions as our Lord and our King and our Master. So Jesus, Jesus is diagnosing the problem. He's saying, see, you can't do enough to inherit eternal life. Now, we should do a quick aside because Jesus dwells so much on money. We need to talk about this for a moment. I will just say Jesus talks about money a bunch in the Gospels. His parables are often about money. He makes similar points in other places. And so you can find much of what I'm gonna say and then some from Jesus, just kind of turn to a page in the Gospels and eventually you're gonna run into him talking about the danger of money. And let me sum up why Jesus parks on this issue so often. Because there is nothing, there is nothing in this world that allures us into a life without God like money. Money enables functional atheism. If you have enough money, this world tells you, you can do whatever you want, control whatever you want, have as much security for as long as you want, feel important among lots of different people. Like everything God promises you, money offers a counter promise to give you the same thing. And you don't even have to wait for it. You don't even have to trust. You don't even have to be humble. You can just go get it and you can have it. Money blinds you to your utter dependence upon God like nothing else. That's why Jesus says somewhere else, you can't serve two masters. You're either gonna serve God or serve money because they are competing, both competing for your heart. And so Jesus warns how difficult it is for the wealthy to enter the kingdom of God. It doesn't say impossible, it doesn't say impossible, it says difficult. And I know what you're thinking. Some of you are like, I know who Jesus is talking about. It's not me. I pulled up in my Kia with 250,000 miles this morning. He's talking about the person in the Land Rover I pulled in who was parked next to me today. Talk about that person. And that may be, but I'll just remind you that relatively speaking, if you're sitting in this room and you're living in the DMV, relatively speaking compared to the rest of the world, you're wealthy. You know, when one billion people today are living on less than $1 a day, you're wealthy. When 26,000 children a day die of preventable diseases in the world, you're wealthy. So let's just kind of clear that up. Jesus is talking about you, whether you have all the money you think you ever need or you're hoping and striving to one day have it, Jesus is saying, beware. Beware the pseudo God, the fake savior of money. And not only that, since we're talking about eternal life, it's probably worth mentioning that you can have all the money in the world and then one day you're gonna give it all back. Everything you own will either rot or go to your kids and they probably don't want it or go to Salvation Army or Goodwill. Right? So we're talking about eternal life. So we need to have some perspective and the sad thing about this story, the tragic thing about this story is this young man comes asking questions about what does my eternity look like? And he settles for temporary joy and significance. And Jesus says, don't, don't fall for it. You can't do enough, he says. You also can't give enough. I love Peter. This is, Peter is the kid in the class who asks the question that kind of annoys you and you're like, actually, it's a pretty good question. I was wondering the same question myself. The disciples are exceedingly astonished by what Jesus says. Don't miss this. They're not looking around like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, yeah, all you rich people. No, they're like, what are you talking about? Why would you say something like that? Who then can be saved? Jesus says, well, yeah, it's difficult, but God changes hearts. You know, God changes us from the inside out. We heard Joe say it a second ago. His word changes hearts and brings us alive to the treasures of heaven over the treasures of earth. It's not impossible, but it could be a challenge, but it's not impossible with God. And then Peter, why he says this, I think we can guess. He says to Jesus, see, we have left everything to follow you. And they had. Go back to chapter one. They left their nets. John and James left their dad in the boat. Right? Gone, three years, gone. Family, friends, home-cooked meals, you know, all of it. God, they left it. Reputation, public safety, all of it, gone, gone, gone. Peter's right, they have left almost everything. And some of you, this would be your story too, right? You can say to Jesus, as you've been following Jesus for any length of time, Jesus, can you see what I've left to follow you? Can you see how many nights, Friday nights, I've spent at home rather than going out with everybody who's partying and doing things that I don't want my heart to be drawn into? Do you see me by myself making that choice? Do you see me, Lord, not taking that job? I can make a lot of money in that job, but I know that that company, ethically, I'm not so sure, but so I didn't do that, and I didn't take the promotion, and I did something else. And Jesus, haven't you seen me leave my family and even experience friction in my family because I've committed to you as a Christian? Jesus, do you see all of that? And Jesus does see all of that. But the way Peter makes this statement smacks something of desperation, doesn't it? Sort of like, yeah, you know, this richy, rich kid, yeah, he can't hang Jesus, but I can hang, right? Like, he's not committed, he's a flake, but not me. I'm gonna stick with you. And by the way, this isn't the last time Peter will say something like this. In four chapters, we'll get there eventually, sometime in 2025 when we get there. Jesus is having a conversation at dinner on the night he is arrested, and Peter said, I just want you to feel this for a second, knowing Peter's story. Jesus says, you will deny me three times, Peter, and Peter says, mm-mm, even if I have to die with you, I will not deny you. Less than three hours later, Jesus says, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Jesus says, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Three hours later. So no, you cannot give enough, sacrifice enough, leave enough behind to inherit eternal life. You can go toe-to-toe with Peter if you want, but Peter is living proof that you just can't do it. So what are we left with? At the end of all this, what are we left with? We're left with this hard news that we can't do enough or give enough to inherit eternal life, and yet Mark gives us a different way. Not necessarily by what Jesus says exactly, but by what he does. The very next thing that happens is that we're told Jesus gets back on the road to Jerusalem, and he explains to his disciples, as he's walking ahead of them, you see that in verse 32, he's walking ahead of them, they're amazed and afraid behind him, and he says to them, I'm going to Jerusalem to be betrayed and to be killed, and after three days to rise. How do we inherit eternal life? Not by doing enough or giving enough. It is only and always because Jesus has done it all, and Jesus has given it all. That Jesus has obeyed the law perfectly, all of the commandments perfectly, and given you all of the credit. Jesus has gone to the cross and paid for all of your sins. All of them, past, present, future, done, deal, and the proof that he did that for you is the fact that three days later, he rose again from the grave. Jesus has done it all and given it all that we might inherit eternal life. That's why the Bible calls this good news. That's good news, because it means that you can rest in the finished work of Christ. Your life does not have to be all about proving to God how good you are, how moral you are, how much you've given up. Jesus has done all of that for you. You are receiving what can only be received, and that is the finished work of Christ. You can rest and not strive and prove and defend yourself over and over and over and over again. You can rest in the finished work of Christ, and you can now relate to one another in new ways. Notice that Jesus responds here by saying, truly, if you leave family and home and friends on my account, I will give you back a hundredfold. And what's in view here are relationships, brothers and sisters and mothers and children, in the faith, a church like this, where people show up for each other like family. So we are now free to give and to love, to sacrifice for one another. And then finally, we can rejoice. This past week, I heard a sermon by a friend of mine, Robert Kim, who teaches at Covenant Seminary, and Robert was talking about a gift that was given to him. He showed it, he brought it out, and he showed it. I asked if I could have it. He said, no, it's his gift. So, you have to imagine. It's a beautiful framed print with Korean characters on it, written in calligraphy. It was given to him by his aunt. So the whole story here goes like this. Robert's grandmother was the most famous calligrapher in all of South Korea. And she taught her daughters how to do this calligraphy, and when they moved to the United States, to Los Angeles, and Robert was growing up around his family there, his aunt came to him when he was being ordained as a pastor and said to him, Robert, I want to make something for you. What do you want me to make for you for your ordination? And he knew right away. He said, Philippians 121. Now, this is part of the reason this clicked with me, because this past Thursday, I'm sorry, Wednesday at Butch Hardman's funeral, he asked that I preach on Philippians 121. So fortunately, I still kind of remember what that was. For to me, to live is Christ, to die is gain. And so she created this beautiful work of art, and when she gave it to him with tears in her eyes and as he was crying, looking at this incredible gift, she says to him, I want this to be part of your inheritance. As a way of saying, I want you to receive this beautiful work given to you, because I know you and I love you. I want you to receive this as something so priceless that nothing else compares. And it's true, like no amount of, even though this is a priceless work of art, he would never sell it. There's no price that would make him give up this inheritance. And what we have for us pictured here is the inheritance that Jesus has prepared for you. He knows you, he loves you. He secured it for you with his own life, so that we might rest in him, so that we might relate to one another as brothers and sisters, and we might rejoice in the inheritance we have in Christ. Our Heavenly Father, we thank you for the inheritance that you have secured for us in Jesus through his life, death, and resurrection. We pray, Lord, that the inheritance we have in him might satisfy us more deeply today than ever, that it might occupy our thoughts, define our lives, that we might live our lives on the timeline of eternity, and not just for the here and now, but even as we do, that we would be more present as we rest in Jesus and relate to one another deeply as brothers and sisters. And as we rejoice, Lord Jesus, that you are the King of heaven, you are bright heaven's sun, you are the ruler of all. We pray in Jesus' name, amen.
