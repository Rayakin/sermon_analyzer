Good morning, everybody. My name is Ryan, I'm the senior pastor here. It's my privilege to open up to Psalm 145 with you. Like most weeks, I would encourage you to have this in front of you as we work through it for a few minutes together. If not on your phone, maybe on the Bible we provided for you there in your seat, or maybe one you brought with you, Psalm 145. Here's one of the reasons why it's a good idea for you to have it open as we go, because there are nuggets I'm gonna point out that you would miss otherwise, and I don't want you to miss anything. I want you locked in from the first moment. I want you seeing what the Lord wants you to see in this passage. Here's one thing that you may not have noticed just in reading through it a few minutes ago. At the very top of Psalm 145, we're told this is a song of praise. Not a big shocker, because the book of Psalms is full of songs of praise. This is actually the only psalm, however, that gives us that subtitle as a hint up front that this is a psalm that is meant to move us to praise the Lord. We also find out this is a psalm of David. That's also not a big surprise. A lot of psalms were written by King David, as in David and Goliath David, and yet this is the last one in the Psalter that is attributed to David. Now, there's only a few more to go, but he gets 145 in before he finishes up his run. Here's one thing you won't see in your English Bibles, but for those of you who are going above and beyond, if you brought your Hebrew Bible today, you would see this immediately, okay? That this is known as an acrostic psalm. It's one of many psalms, well, roughly nine or 10, depending on how you count, or eight or nine, depending on how you count, that form an acrostic. Now, an acrostic, like when you hear someone write a poem that's an acrostic, or you get a greeting card that's an acrostic, A is for awesome, B is for brave, C is for cute, and all that, right? What's going on here in this psalm is each line begins with the letter of the Hebrew alphabet. Aleph begins it, and then we go to Bath, and all the way through. Now, we don't know exactly why David reached for this particular literary device. We can guess, so like in our own language, you'll often hear an acrostic as a way of helping someone remember something, like what was A for again? Oh yeah, A was for awesome, right? B was for brave, C was for cute, right? You got the idea, so it helps you remember something that the author wants you to remember. It's also, depending on how you look at it, sort of beautiful, there's an aesthetic quality to it. So when you consider the theme of this psalm, and the theme is that God is a good king, when you consider that theme, what this psalm wants us to move us toward this morning is praise that is both memorable and beautiful. Like we would hear this proclamation that God, our God is a good king, and our hearts would swell, that that would be something that would get kind of stuck in our heads, like one of those songs, you can't get out of your head, kind of stuck in your head, but also stuck in your heart, that it would be the song of your life to praise God because he is the good king. And so that's what we want to talk about this morning, how this psalm helps us praise God, not just in our heads, but also in our hearts. Let me pray for us as we open up this psalm together. Father, we thank you for your word. We thank you for feeding us this morning with your word. We pray, Lord, that we would bring our hunger to you, very intentionally, all of us come into this place with longings and desires that are yet fulfilled, and yet this psalm promises that you satisfy the desires of our hearts. And we know that one of the ways you do that is by speaking to us and revealing and disclosing to us who you are, so do that now, Lord, we pray, for the glory of Christ and by the power of the spirit. Amen. So how does this theme of God being a good king, how does that get stuck in our heads and in our hearts? This psalm gives us two ways to act on it, two ways to work this psalm into our lives. First of all, we need to lift up God as the good king. We need to lift him up in worship as the good king. And then we need to live for him in our daily lives. We need to lift him up and we need to live for him. Now that language of lifting up, I'm getting from the first verse, actually the first word in this psalm, that word extol. That verb is one of about 10 verbs that we find in Psalm 145, all of them talking about worship and praise, declaring, commending, but extol, extol is a word that literally means to lift up. It also means to lift up figuratively. It's not really a word we use very much. If you were to ask me where I want to go to lunch and I replied something like, well, I extol the tacos at Taco Bamba. And so I think we should go there. You'd be like, I understand completely what you're saying, except for the word extol. I think I know what you mean, but I'm not sure that that's a word that you should be using. But it's a word that means something that means something, right? So if after a great game or a huge victory or some sort of championship game, the team lifts up the coach or lifts up a player and carries him or her off the field, we understand what that means. That's a way of lifting someone up so that person can be seen and admired. If sports aren't really your thing, then the Lion King, right? The first few minutes of the Lion King, what happens? Simba is born and he's brought to the top of a cliff and what happens? He's lifted up so everyone can see and rejoice that there is a new king to be crowned one day. Lifting up literally with our hands, with our bodies, is also something we do figuratively when we want something to be admired. So we extol, we lift up, we praise someone, even if they're not there, like, do you know so-and-so? This person's amazing. We're lifting them up in someone else's presence. Or if we have a favorite television show or a favorite vacation spot or a favorite hobby, we'll often lift those up in praise so that other people can see and admire. The fact is, as human beings made in God's image, we are chronic extolers. Like, there's no off switch. We do it because we're made to do it. And so what David is doing here is not abnormal or just like sort of in the religious category of life. What he's doing is he's saying, of all the things in the world that are worth extolling, and there are a lot of things, tacos included, okay? There is one king who is worthy of eternal praise. And he wants our hearts and our minds to be locked in on him. Now, he does this by pointing out a few things. First of all, who he is. And the summary statement of who God is can be found in verse eight. The Lord is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love. Even in David's day, this was not original, okay? David didn't just come up with this. This dates all the way back to a time when Moses was on Mount Sinai, okay? As in Moses, let my people go. Moses crossed in the Red Sea. Moses 10 commandments, we got the guy. Moses is on Mount Sinai and he asks the Lord, show me your glory. And so the Lord squeezes him into this cleft of a rock face. Just imagine him sitting in there waiting for the Lord to pass by. A cloud descends, the Lord passes by. This is Exodus chapter 34. And as he passes by, what does he do? He speaks his name. Just think about this for a second. The living God speaks his name. He tells us who he is. And what does he say? The Lord, the Lord, Yahweh, Yahweh. A God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness. Okay, not verbatim to what David says, pretty close. We know where David's getting his material and what he's beckoning us to do, what he's coaxing us to do is to ask ourselves the question this morning, is this the God we came to worship? Do we know him, that he is gracious toward you, that he's merciful towards you, that he leans towards you in compassion? He's slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness. Doesn't that begin to coax worship out of your heart, that this is who he is at the core of his being. And not only is that who he is, David also lists for us what he has done. In verses four through six, we get different phrases to sum up what God has done. Mighty acts, wondrous works, awesome deeds. Now, he doesn't tell us what exactly he's referring to here, but we can probably fill in the blanks if we read the rest of the Bible. The creation of all things out of nothing. Okay, I think that qualifies as a mighty act. Certainly worthy of our praise and our worship. For David and for the Old Testament people of God, they would be looking back to the Exodus as the great redemptive event when God rescued his people from slavery and brought them across the Red Sea on dry land and destroyed Pharaoh's army. That was a wondrous work. But of course, we have to put this in our own context as well. So standing from our perspective, looking back, we have in the past that culminating event of mighty acts and wondrous works, the work of Jesus himself. Not just his miracles, which are worthy of our worship, but the awesome and mighty and wondrous act, par excellence, which is God himself giving himself for us that we might belong to him. Listen to the way the Apostle Paul in Colossians 1 summarizes in his own fashion what it is that God has done for us through Jesus. He has delivered us from the domain of darkness. He has transferred us into the kingdom of light. He has redeemed us from the grave. He has granted us forgiveness for all of our sins. And Paul's just getting started. So why do we lift up God as a good king? Because of who he is, because of what he's done most beautifully and in most compelling fashion in the person and work of Jesus. And then thirdly, David puts before us what he continues to do. Not just what he's done, but what he continues to do right before our eyes every single second of every single day. This is what I mean by that. In verses four and six, four through six, those mighty acts, those really are the saving events most likely that David has in mind. The way in which God has acted in history to save his people by grace, even though they didn't deserve it, even though we don't deserve God's mercy and compassion, he shows it to us because he is abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness. That's what we might call his saving grace. But it's also true that what's in view here is what theologians call God's common grace. Let me just show it to you in this passage and then explain what we mean by that. In verse 15 he says, the eyes of all look to you. Okay, not just your people, not just those who have trusted you for salvation, but all look to you and you give them their food in due season. You open your hand, verse 16. You satisfy the desire of every living thing. What's being described here is not grace for the purpose of salvation, it's grace that's shown to all for the purpose of blessing. That God is a good king to all who live in his kingdom. Jesus gives us some ways to think about this. In his most famous sermon in Matthew chapter five, Jesus is preaching the Sermon on the Mount and he says, you know, the sun, it shines on both the evil and the good. Like the blessings of God are indiscriminate in that sense. It's not just the righteous who get sunshine, it's everybody who lives in San Diego gets sunshine all the time, right? And it's not just the good farmers, the just farmers who, you know, tithe the crops and whatnot, they're not the only ones who get rain, the unjust ones do too. You know, life is not like a Charlie Brown cartoon where a little, you know, cloud of rain follows around the unjust. Now I'm kind of flipping the metaphor, I guess, but you get the idea. Like everyone, everyone, regardless of whether they accept or reject God's authority, everyone benefits from the blessings of our creator and our sustainer every single day, every single second of every single day. It's God's common grace. Behind every meal, behind every marriage, behind every medical breakthrough, behind every meaningful conversation stands a good and gracious king. That's James chapter one. Every good and perfect gift is where? It comes from where? It comes from above, from the father of lights, every single one of them to every person who enjoys it. Now, this might be a good time to point out to you if you haven't already noticed how the psalm begins. The psalm begins with David saying, I will extol you. He says it again in verse two, I will bless you, future tense. Now, I don't want to make too much of this. I don't know all that's going on in David's mind to write this. It just seems to me this is significant that in light of everything that David has said about who God is and what he has done and what he continues to do, that David isn't just speaking in the present tense, like I extol you, I bless you, I praise you. He says, I will, I will, I will. As if to say, even when the circumstances of my life do not scream to me that God is a good king, I will, I will. Because some of you read this, some of you read what God does every single day, that he satisfies the desire of every living thing and you're thinking through your week and you're thinking through your month and you're thinking through the last 10 years, and you're like, not for me, he hasn't. Gracious, merciful, maybe, I don't know. What David is giving us here then is a blueprint to be a sort of defiant worshiper. And by defiant, what I mean is to defy the circumstances in your life that might suggest or lead you to believe that God is not who he says he is. And David himself is saying, no, I will choose, I will extol you, I will declare. Even in that moment of temptation this week, when your heart is led astray by lesser things, by lesser kings, by things that are not worthy of your whole self, there is this resolute planting of the flag to say, I will, I will. I will bless you, I will extol you, oh Lord, my God and king. And not only to lift him up, but also to live for him. Let's think a little bit about what it means to live for our good king. I don't want to belabor this point, because I feel like we've said this several times when we've been going through the Psalms, but it's worth pointing out once again, how verbal this Psalm is. Like everything that we're being instructed to do just about requires words, right, to declare. We even have the language in verse seven of pouring forth, of announcing, of commending, of praising, of blessing. Like the only one I could find that you could pull off in a silent manner is the word meditate. Okay, that one, I'll give that one to you. Everything else is loud, it's verbal, it involves speaking, and not to yourself only, but to other people. Just notice the way that the Psalm is bookended, I will extol you, my God and king, and it finishes with my mouth will speak the praise of the Lord. For what purpose? That all flesh might bless his holy name forever and ever. So here's just a practical takeaway from this Psalm and about 146 other Psalms. The Psalms call us to be public praisers of God in our everyday lives. When we see God pulling off what he says he promises to do, his goodness and everyday blessings, we don't have to be obnoxious about it. You don't have to be obnoxious about it, like praise the Lord every five seconds, no. You know, not inviting the office to bow in prayer every 10 minutes, no. But a real conscious awareness that you have been placed, where you have been placed to live for the king with your words. Which is only natural for someone whose head and heart are captivated by the goodness of our king. So we live for him with our words, we also live for him with our work, with our work. One of the main conversations that's happening here, you may have picked up on it, verse four, one generation shall commend your works to another. And it goes on from there in the next few verses to describe this cross-generational conversation that's happening. Now of course it's not limited to older generations telling younger generations how it is. That certainly seems like what we're talking about at least initially. The idea here that those who have gone before speak to those who are coming along and commend to them the gospel of grace. And the most immediate application of this, we've already talked a little bit about this morning, when just in and around the baptism, is within the context of family. That part of the responsibility of Christian parents is to commend the faith. Okay, not just to lecture, but to persuade, to commend, to live out by example, to declare, not perfectly, but in a way that the next generation takes the baton and runs with it. Now, if you've ever tried this as a parent, and I'm just looking around, and I suspect many of you have tried this, you know this is hard. Like it's hard when your kids, who are all sitting still really well right now, and that's to your credit, but when your kids normally don't sit through a meal without starting a fight, and then they're like, and by the way, would you do some family devotions while you're at it? I'm like, well, I'm just trying to get them to eat. Like I'm just trying to get them not to hit each other, and now you're having me do in-depth, inductive Bible study with my kids, right? Like you feel the tension of knowing you need to commend, but also recognizing how hard it is. Now, I don't know if this is gonna make you feel any better or not, young parents, but it doesn't get any easier. It doesn't get much easier, whether your kids are seven or 17 or 47. Like the task, the burden, the responsibility of commending the faith to the next generation, it's hard work. It's hard work, but it's good work. And so if you're in the thick of it, and you feel like, man, I'm just barely getting by, I just want to encourage you, parents, it's good work. You don't always see the fruit in the moment. I want to encourage you a little more than that, because you probably knew all that. I want to encourage you in another way from this psalm. The other way I want to encourage you is what this psalm promises. This psalm promises that God will have a people for himself from every generation, right? And so we have this promise, they, this is the receiving generation, they shall pour forth the fame of your abundant goodness and shall sing aloud of your righteousness. And I know I'm lobbying that into a cultural conversation, which from my vantage point is more or less antagonistic toward generational conversation. So you've got younger generations calling older generations, things like boomers, right? By the way, if you're a boomer, that's not a compliment. Did you know that's not a compliment? Okay, if it's coming from someone under 30, that's not a compliment. And then you have boomers saying to millennials, you know, you're just a bunch of snowflakes and it's not a compliment either. And then you've got Gen X who are sort of like watching the bombs fly over and you're like, what about me, you know, over here? And then Gen Y is like rolling their eyes, like whatever, right? I mean, none of it is ultimately productive. Everyone's complaining about the other person and that they don't understand. And in the midst of all of that, you have the ancient wisdom of Psalm 145, say to each and every one of us, God is calling a people for himself from every generation. That's hopeful for me. So as I get older and I see, you know, the way the world's going and the questions that my kids are gonna have to answer, like I'm not really sure how I would enter into all of that. I'm not sure that it just doesn't feel big and scary to me from my vantage point, but the hope is, no, God is actually forming a generation of Christians who will answer those questions in a compelling and winsome and beautiful way and stand for Christ. We don't have to live out of fear in these conversations. We live out of the hope that God is a good King. God will do what he says he's going to do so that we can learn across generations. It doesn't just have to be categorizing each other. Actually, the category ought to be those who love the Lord. Let's commend. And by the way, the work here is not just the work of families. It's also the work of church. I know not all of you are parents, and so that's not gonna land exactly with you, but this is part of the reason as a church, we feel so strongly and invest so much in our children's and student ministry. It's not just to entertain kids while the adults are doing adult things. No, you saw it just a second ago. Joe said it a second ago when he was getting ready to do the baptism. Like, we believe that our youngest members are members of the church. We're not recruiting the JV, right? Our kids are not JV, and then you have varsity, and maybe you have like the freshman team in between. We believe that our kids are not just the future of the church, they're the present of the church. And so we say it's a responsibility for us to invest in the next generation through children's ministry, through student ministry. And some of you have invested your time and your energy in those ministries, and here again, I just wanna encourage you. Leading a small group Bible study for seventh grade boys, man, let me just pronounce the benediction over you right now. Not easy, not easy. Good work, can I just tell you, good work. Someone did that for me. I turned out okay, a little weird, but okay. And not only our student ministry, our children's ministry, but also our fellows program, which just providentially we prayed for all these things today. The reason we're gonna welcome 14 or 16 new fellows into, I forget the number, it's either 14 or 16, to season 17 here at the Capitals Fellows Program in just a couple weeks from all over the country, recent college grads to spend nine months with us. The reason we're doing that is we actually are banking on what God says here, that he is raising up a new generation to be salt and light in a world some of us don't completely understand. But that we need people who are through their work and through their witness serve Christ. So there are hundreds of you, hundreds of you, in this room probably hundreds of you who have invested in that ministry, not just financially, but by hosting a fellow and finding jobs and being a mentor. It's good work. Do you see that it's living for the king practically in the everyday life that's being commended to us here? And then finally, let me say this. Since we're speaking of fellows and vocation, this is the reason why your work matters. Not just serving in children's and student ministries, thank you for that, but your Monday through Saturday work, that it matters. Think about it this way. Consider the ambitious agenda that's laid out for us here. What does God say he's going to do? He's going to uphold all who are falling. He's going to raise up those who are bowed down. He's going to feed those who are hungry. He's going to satisfy the desire of every living thing. He's going to be near to those who call to him who are lonely. He's going to hear their cries. How does he pull that off? Through you. And not on Sunday. Tomorrow and the next day through your everyday work, he accomplishes his work. Martin Luther put it like this. God gives every good thing, but not just by waving his hand. We pray for daily bread and he gives us farmers and bakers and truck drivers and people who work in the grocery store. We pray for healing and he gives us nurses and doctors and physical therapists. We pray for our kids to grow up and to flourish as human beings. He gives us teachers and school counselors and coaches. Lawyers usually don't make that list, but I'm sure that people pray for something and lawyers do something. I'm just kidding. I just offended about 75% of the crowd. Sorry about that, but you get the idea. Your work lives out this psalm every single day. That's a lot to remember even for a psalm that is designed to help us remember these things. Here's the good news. The good news is that David says that this song of praise is a song we're going to sing forever. Verse two, every day I will bless your name and praise your name forever and ever. Last line of the psalm, let all flesh bless his holy name forever and ever. Can you imagine something being so glorious and great that you can sing about it forever and not get tired of that? I can't. Grand Canyon, as advertised. It's amazing. I think if you were a park ranger, if that were your vocation, park ranger at the Grand Canyon, I think you wake up every day, you're like, this place is amazing again. I just don't think that really gets old, but let's just say you put that on a spectrum of a thousand years, like by year 156, you're like, I think I might like to see something else. At some point, the greatness, even of the greatest thing, you hit the bottom. But David says, the greatness of the Lord, unsearchable. His kingdom, everlasting. It reminds me of the last few lines of the Narnia books, The Last Battle. The last book of the Narnia series, The Last Battle. C.S. Lewis is talking about the children moving from old Narnia to new Narnia, and as they're making their way, C.S. Lewis speaks to us as readers, and he says this, and for this, this is the end of all the stories, so he's addressing you as the reader, and we can most truly say that all the characters, all the children, they lived happily ever after, but for them, it was only the beginning of the real story. All their life in this world, and all their adventures in Narnia had only been the cover and the title page. Now, at last, they were beginning chapter one of the great story, which no one on earth has read, which goes on forever, in which every chapter is better than the one before. Heavenly Father, we thank you that you have once again made good on your promise to satisfy the desires of our hearts. May the hope of the gospel and the peace that comes with it and the joy of our salvation be our song and our strength, we pray in Christ's name. Amen.
