Good morning, everybody. My name is Ryan Laughlin. I'm a senior pastor here. It's my delight to open up to Psalm 90 with you. Before we dig in, just one more announcement and invitation. After our 1045 service, we're going to have a reception for Matt Litson. So Matt's been leading us in worship this morning, and you probably already know this, but Matt's accepted a call to be the senior pastor of a church in Madison, Wisconsin, Resurrection Press. And we are sad to see him go. Matt has been a faithful servant of this church as a pastor in many different capacities. And as I'm sure you already noticed today, he's a gifted guy. And while it's sad to say goodbye, it's also wonderful to see the Lord call men like Matt, who love the church and love the Word and love Jesus, to go love people in places that desperately need the gospel. And this is one of them, but so is Madison, Wisconsin. So we reluctantly send him with our blessings. I know you would also like to express your appreciation for Matt. Personally, if you haven't done that already, I'll just give you one more chance because they leave in just a week or two. So after the 1045 service in the Grand Foyer downstairs, there'll be a reception for Matt and Kelsey and Emery as we bid them Godspeed as the Lord's sends them. So let's pray and then we'll jump in. Father, we do thank you for the Litzens and for the ministry they've had here, for the way you've gifted both Matt and Kelsey for ministry. We pray, Lord, along with this psalm, that you would establish the work of their hands. And now, Lord, as we open up to this portion of your Word, we pray that you would help us in these moments to number our days well, that you would grant us a heart of wisdom, that even as we hear from you, you would satisfy us with your steadfast love and make us glad. Make us glad to be in your presence and to know something more of Jesus. We ask in Christ's name. Amen. So after a week of studying this psalm, I will tell you, I love Psalm 90. I loved it before, I love it even more now. I think part of the reason for that is you'll notice right away that this is a psalm that's written by Moses, that Moses, like let my people go Moses, which means this may be, we don't know for sure, but this may be the oldest psalm in the Psalter. And yet, it is surprisingly modern. I read about the things that are occupying Moses's mind as he's there in the wilderness on the brink of the promised land, and I think, man, these are the things I think about. These are the questions I have about life. This is the tension I feel when it comes to time. The lives we lead are so full of joy, and yet that joy can be so elusive. You know, like one moment we're so grateful for the time we have, the next moment we're like, that just flew by, and that moment's never coming back. Work can be so meaningful and so frustrating. And what's wonderful about this psalm is that one of the wonderful things is that Moses is able to say so much in just a few verses. Most of our movies and our books and our songs that take up these same themes, they'll take two or three hours to articulate what they want to say about living in this tension of life. But Moses not only names that tension for us, he helps us navigate it in a really compelling way. And he does it in Psalm 90 by giving us two reference points, and those are the two things I want to talk about this morning. First reference point, you are here. You are here. Second reference point, you are home. You are here, Moses says. You are home. You'll notice from the very beginning of this psalm, Moses is preoccupied with the topic of time. Very first verse, God, you are the everlasting God. You are eternal, he's saying in a moment ago. We are a moment. You are eternal. You are from everlasting to everlasting. And this acknowledgement of the eternity of God is the backdrop for everything that comes next, which is you are eternal, we are not. In comparison to you, God, for whom 10,000 years seems just like yesterday, our lives are fleeting. They are here today, gone tomorrow. They're like a flash flood that sweeps things away. They're like the grass that renews in the morning, gets scorched by the sun in the afternoon, is gone and withered by the evening. Our lives are like a dream. Moses is not having a midlife crisis, might sound like that. He's just naming what is true, that tomorrow is not promised to you, and that life is short, and sometimes painfully so. He's not the first person to notice this. He's certainly not the last. For example, the 17th century English poet, Andrew Marvell, not Marvel. I know some of you got very excited there for a moment, but we're talking about 17th century British poetry, so you can go back to sleep for a few minutes. But this may sound familiar to you at some point, maybe like sophomore English class. You remember studying this poem in which Marvell says this, Always at my back I hear time's winged chariot hurrying near. Like right behind him, he feels time pressing, pressing, pressing. This is the first reality that Moses wants us to understand, that we live life on the clock. More recently, someone many of you know and love, Ellen Vaughn, has written in her cool little book, Time, Peace, which explores what it means to live with God in time, says this, The toasts of the wedding feast speak of glad new beginnings, but they signal endings too. Graduation, some of you have been celebrating graduations and weddings this summer. Graduations are not just the happy toss of a tasseled hat, but a step through a one-way door. Parents, you feel that? I felt that in graduation, a step through a one-way door. Beauty hurts because it passes. Well, that's kind of a downer, isn't it? But it's true. This is life. Life is lived under the clock. We know that even the most beautiful moments have a shadow cast across those moments, and that shadow is the reality that time is passing faster than we want it to, that the moments that we enjoy are also moments we're never going to get back. And what do you do with that? I mean, it's a rhetorical question, but I want you to think about that. Like, what do you do with that? Some of us pretend it's not true. So we just act as if we have all the time in the world, which isn't true, but you can live that way if you want to. But others of us want to be intentional with the time we have, and so we want to seize the day. What we mean by that is we cram as many experiences and as much fun and as much pleasure and as much entertainment into each day that we can cram into a day. Regardless of the consequences, all that matters is right now, because I don't know that I have tomorrow, and you don't want to take that chance. Now, others of us, especially those of us in DC, have maybe a more virtuous, at least in our mindset, a more virtuous way of going about this. Rather than just seizing the day and cramming it full of activity and entertainment and experiences, we optimize the day. See, that's the thing to do. You get the most out of it. You have electronics that tell you, like, if you slept well the night before, my question is, what if you didn't? Like, what do you do with that information? You tell other people about it, but that's about all you can do. But you're optimizing your sleep and your diet and your workout plan, and you have life hacks so you can do things that used to take two and a half minutes in a minute and a half. And you schedule yourself tight, and you make sure that you get everything done that you need to get done. And then you begin to wonder, why am I doing all of this? See, the problem with just optimizing or seizing the day, like just taking this idea, I'm going to get the most out of every single day, which is a good thing in and of itself, but by itself, it falls short. And the reason for that is, Moses tells us we don't only live on the clock, we live under the curse. I mean, that's really the most haunting thing about this psalm, that Moses is introducing to us not only a time problem, but a sin problem. You may have noticed that throughout the psalm, Moses is connecting the dots between the shortness of our lives and the sinfulness of our hearts. And so he says things like, in verse 7, we are brought to an end by your anger, by your wrath, we are dismayed. For all our days, verse 9, pass under your wrath. And then he asks a question, both for his audience, for those Israelites in the wilderness with him, but also for us in the wilderness of our own experience. Verse 11, who considers the power of your anger and your wrath according to the fear of you? Remember that Moses has watched an entire generation in the wilderness perish precisely because they didn't consider the power of God's anger or the reality of God's wrath. They decided to try to make life work on their own and try to make life work without God, and they went their own way and turned away from God. And the response, Moses tells us in verse 3, is that God returns them to dust. You see, that's an illusion that verse 3, God saying to the children of man, return to dust. That's an illusion to Genesis chapter 3, the beginning of the Bible, the beginning of human history, which explains so much about where we are today and our own experience in this world when Adam and Eve, our first parents, turned away from God, defied him and disobeyed him, and decided to make life work on their own without God as their king and their judge. And the response that God had to their sin was to utter this curse that because of their sin, their lives were ruined, their lives were broken. They had turned away, and therefore, they would face the consequences of their sin, which was death. Genesis chapter 3, God says, to dust you shall return. And that wasn't just the consequence they experienced, it's the consequence we still experience. The greatest evidence that we live in a world that has been wrecked and ruined by human sin is the ever-present reminder of death. That the shortness of our lives isn't just the circle of life coming to a natural conclusion, it's the fact that death has entered into our world. The last and greatest enemy of each and every one of us is one that continues to plague us. And yet, God has done something about it. In the New Testament, we read in Galatians chapter 3 that Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us. That is to say, God, through Jesus, entered into our world as one of us that he might redeem us from the curse, that he might bear the wrath of God for us, that he might endure the righteous anger of God we deserve for our sin, that we might be redeemed, that we might be bought back. And not only that, Romans 8 tells us that because of the finished work of Jesus, his life, death, and the resurrection, all of creation, which is now groaning because of the curse, will one day be liberated when Jesus returns to set all things right and make all things new. Now, that may seem like a long way from you are here. Because honestly, where you are right now, like right now is you're just thinking about, how am I possibly going to enjoy summer vacation next week when I know that I'm hanging out with my family? Like, that's what you want to know. Or, how am I going to handle the situation at work which is stressing me out? Or, how am I going to have that conversation with my boyfriend or my girlfriend or my husband or my wife that I know I have to have but I really don't want to have? Like, those are the questions of the moment for you. It seems like a long way from the Lord returning and setting creation free and all of the rest of that. I get that. One of the things I love about this psalm is that those questions are on the table as well, as we'll see in just a moment. But it does remind me of something some of you may have seen along with me a couple of weeks ago. So, I'll admit, I didn't watch much of the NBA finals this year. No particular reason for that, just didn't end up doing it. But I did see the interview afterwards, and some of you may have seen that too. One of the stars of the Denver Nuggets, they won the NBA finals this year, the championship. Nikola Jovic, a Serbian player, was named the finals MVP, okay? So, Jovic, his hulking frame, is sitting there at the podium after the game, after the final game, championship trophy not too far away, MVP trophy not far away from his grasp. And he's sitting there and one of the journalists asks him, are you excited about the championship parade in Denver on Thursday? And he kind of goes, what parade are you talking about? Like, on Thursday, there's a parade. And he has this look on his face. First of all, he says, well, I just want you to know, I'm like really grateful for all this, but honestly, I really need to go home. And everybody laughed. He didn't laugh. So, here's a guy, 28 years old, grew up in a two-bedroom apartment in Serbia with his family, an extended family. Goes to the NBA, wins the championship, becomes the MVP, is about to be the, about to have the spotlight put on him. Hundreds and thousands of people are going to be chanting his name and cheering his accomplishments. And all he can think about in that moment, I really want to go home. Now, that made the rounds on the internet. Maybe some of you saw that. For good reason. People were delighted by what he said. People were sort of confused by what he said. But actually, I think this is what Moses is telling us in this passage, that even when you get everything your heart desires, there is still going to be something deep inside of you that simply wants to be home. Moses says it in verse 1. Lord, you have been our dwelling place. Not, Lord, you have constructed a dwelling place for us. Thank you for that. Not, Lord, you have dropped a pin on our dwelling place. Now we know how to get there. Thanks so much. Lord, you are the home our hearts long for. St. Augustine said it like this in a famous prayer. Oh Lord, you have made us for yourself and our hearts are restless until they rest in you. Oh my goodness. Well, that just opens up a whole world of explanation as to why I am the way I am, why you are the way you are, how it's possible for you to have achieved everything you've wanted in life. And look, some of you have. And yet for there still to be this restlessness in our hearts. And the reason for that is because you were made for God. And until God is your home, your heart will be restless. You'll keep searching. You'll keep looking. And as you feel the press of time, you'll become more and more frantic to find it. What does it mean for Moses to say to God and to encourage us to say the same that you are home? Well, just think about what a healthy, happy home ought to be. And I understand not all of you grew up in a healthy, happy home. I get that. But I think all of us know what a home ought to be. Maybe we've seen it. Maybe we have experienced it. But a home fundamentally is a place where we walk in and we're with people who say, you belong here. And by the way, these are the people who know you best. That's the crazy thing about it. It's the people who, you know, they haven't just seen the home movies, they were in the home movies with you. Like all the quirks, all the mistakes, all the failure, doesn't matter. You're family. You're here. You belong. Doesn't matter if you're 10, 20, 30, 40, 60. Home is a place distinguished from all other communities and all other places. It's the place where we belong. And I think that's what Moses is driving at when he prays in verse 13, return, O Lord, how long? Have pity on your servants. He's saying, Lord, we know that we've turned away from you, but welcome your children back with mercy. And did God ever answer that prayer, not just for the people of this generation, but most fully and beautifully in Jesus? That same book, Galatians, Galatians chapter four, the Apostle Paul says, but in the fullness of time, God sent forth his son, born of a woman, born under the law to redeem those under the law so that we might receive adoption as sons and daughters. Listen to how that explains the problem and solves the problem that Moses is setting up here, that God put himself on the clock in Jesus, entered into our time and our space, placed himself under the law to redeem those under the law that we might receive adoption as sons and daughters. Listen, so that you would belong and you would know you belong. Not just now, but forever, that the Lord would be your home. And a home is not only a place of belonging, it's also a place of joy. This is one of the most striking things about this psalm, is that by the end of it, after everything Moses has said, and even though it seems like he's flirting with depression here in his outlook, at the end of it, he's asking for joy, as if such joy is possible. Not fake joy, not joy that's just like, how are you doing? I'm fine. Really? Oh yeah, I'm fine. Plastic smile. That's not what's being offered to us here. Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us. Satisfy us in the morning. Make us rejoice and be glad all our days. See, Moses knows that life is toil and trouble. He knows that life is a dream that fades away too quickly. He knows that there is the shadow of mortality cast across all of the beautiful and joyful things of life, and yet he still believes it's possible in the midst of that tension to experience real joy. And how does God answer that prayer? He answers that prayer by becoming like us to taste our sadness that we might share in his joy. Think about what it means for the eternal God to be your home. It means that you can experience joy now in the moment with grateful hands, but also knowing that eternal joy awaits. What does Jesus tell us he will say to us when he welcomes us on the other side of death? The words he says we will hear, well done, good and faithful servant, enter into the joy of your master. Christian, do you know this? Do you know that your best days are always ahead of you? Because the resurrection is true, that the deepest longings of your heart will one day be satisfied in full. And that's not just a later thing, that's a now thing, that's a present moment thing because it allows us just to release our grip on each day that we could actually number our days to receive the good things that God has given us with gratitude, not ask too much of them than they're designed to give. I mentioned a few moments ago that movies have often tried to capture this tension and navigate a way out of them. I think there are a lot of movies and books and music that actually articulate a lot of what Moses is saying but never quite find a way out. We're good as a culture about naming the tension, we're not really good about navigating a way out of it. But one of the movies that was influential for people I think of my generation was the 1989 movie Dead Poets Society. There are all kinds of reasons for that, we could talk about it afterwards for those of you in that narrow band of cultural fluency. But it's a story about boys at a boarding school, high schoolers, there's a teacher, Mr. Keating, played by Robin Williams, who's this eccentric teacher who speaks into their lives in new and exciting ways. He's teaching them poetry. And in one memorable scene, they all go out in the hallway and they go to the trophy case in the hallway. And in the hallway, in the trophy case, there are photographs of past classes, like the class of like, you know, 1885 or something like that. And so they're looking at these photographs of men who went to the school, graduated, grew up, maybe went off to war, came back, and are either old men or have since passed on. And Mr. Keating is behind them and all these high school boys have their faces pressed up against the glass. He goes, lean in closer, boys, lean in. They lean in and he says, just lean in a little closer and see if you can hear them speaking to you from the grave. So they lean in a little closer and then he sneaks up behind them and he says, seize the day. Carpe diem, boys. And that's the point of the movie, that some of them decide to take him up on this, like, okay, our life's going to be about seizing the day, getting the most out of every moment, which has beautiful moments and actually, if you watch the movie, really tragic ones, too. Why? Because seizing the day isn't enough. Now, it made a big impact on a 17, 18 year old boy who had romantic notions about the world, but as you get a little older and as you live a little more life, you realize what Moses says is true, that it's not enough to seize the day. We have to do what he says here. We have to number our days. Yes, make the most of them, but do so with an awareness. You are here. Life is fleeting. Sin is your greatest emergency. You need Jesus to rescue you so that you might know, not just now, but forever, that you are secure in his love and know that God is the home that your heart longs for. Stop chasing after the things of the world in a way that's restless and frantic and rest in the knowledge that you are known by your creator and loved by him because of what Jesus has done for you. Number your days. Be satisfied with his steadfast love. Yes, it's true that we must make the most of every day, but we truly must first understand that all of our days are in his hands. Let me pray for us. Father, we thank you for this wonderful psalm, this reminder that our lives are lived out in your hands. We pray, Lord, that you'd help us to number our days, that we all, as a church, might gain a heart of wisdom so that we might glorify you in our lives. We ask it in Jesus' name. Amen.
