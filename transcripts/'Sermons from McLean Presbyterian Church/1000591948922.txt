Happy New Year to you all. I'm very happy to see you all today, as well as those who are worshiping with us online. My name is Terrence Little, and I serve as pastor of ministries here at McLean, and I'm very glad to be worshiping with you today. Today, we return to the book of Mark, the gospel of Mark, in our series entitled Follow the King. And to provide a bit of context for where we are in the book of Mark today, where we've been, Jesus has just posed two major questions to the disciples while they were traveling to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. You see that beginning in verse 27. The first question Jesus asks his disciples is, who do people say that I am? The people witnessed Jesus preaching, teaching, healing, providing food for thousands, and more on more than one occasion, turning impossible situations into miraculous reality. Who do people say that I am? Then he posed this question to his disciples. But who do you say that I am? These 12 disciples have also witnessed the incredible man, Jesus, who is a man, and yet he is more than a man. We like to say in theology, he is the God man. 100% God, 100% man. And I heard a man say this many years ago. 100% plus 100% equals 100%. 100% all right. They've heard him teach. They've seen the miracles. They've had front row seats to his absolute power. But who do you say that I am, asks Jesus. Why does he raise these questions at this point in his ministry with his disciples? You know, when you're doing Bible study, you need to be asking questions. Why does Jesus ask this question at this particular time? Jesus raises the question because it was time to teach his disciples the central purpose for his mission, for his coming to the earth as a man. And this leads us to our scripture passage for today, Mark chapter 8. I'm going to read verses 31 through 38. And he began to teach them that the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed. And after three days, rise again. And he said this plainly. And Peter took him aside, began to rebuke him. But turning and seeing his disciples, Jesus rebuked Peter and said, get behind me, Satan, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man. And calling the crowd to him with his disciples, Jesus said to them, if anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it. But whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospels will save it. For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul? For what can a man give in return for his soul? For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the son of man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his father with the holy angels. This is the word of the Lord. Would you pray with me? Eternal father, shine the light of your truth into every heart. Allow us to hear with understanding. Transform us, Holy Spirit, according to the word of the Lord. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. We have two points this morning. Two points. The first, Jesus' mission is focused. Jesus' mission is focused. And the second point, Jesus' mission is costly. Jesus' mission is costly. Number one, Jesus' mission is focused. In verse 31, Jesus teaches the disciples a new lesson. A new lesson. Jesus begins to tell the disciples exactly why he came into the world. The purpose for why he turns decay into life. Why he gives plenty to the hungry. Why he reverses sickness and death by restoring life with good health. Jesus, the son of man, will have to suffer. He's going to have to suffer. And he says he's going to have to suffer many things. Jesus also says he's going to be rejected, denied by the elders, chief priests, the scribes. And I want you to think about this list. Think about this list. Elders, chief priests, scribes, all Israelites who are deeply associated with the Mosaic law and the sacrifices. They are going to reject Jesus. And Jesus says that he's going to be killed. He's going to die. He says he's going to rise again, though after three days he's going to come back to life. And this is a different lesson than what the disciples are accustomed to hearing from Jesus. First, Jesus calls himself the son of man. Now what in the world does that mean, Terrence? Well, it means that he is the Messiah. He is the anointed one. He is the promised one talked about all throughout the scriptures of the Old Testament. The promised one of God. But I also want you to remember that Peter, Andrew, James, John, they saw Jesus heal Peter's mother-in-law when she was sick. The disciples saw Jesus cast a demonic spirit out of a man. They watched Jesus show incredible dignity and love while healing a man with leprosy. They were rejected. Those were people who were set outside of the city. And Jesus made time for him and they saw it. They saw Jesus marvel at the faith of four men who believed if they could just get their paralyzed friend to Jesus, that friend would walk again. Remember, remember these disciples heard Jesus teach with great authority and power. They saw him arise from peaceful sleep during a terrible storm. And just, he just spoke words of command to the wind and to the sea and they obeyed. They saw Jesus make time for a man who was cutting himself, living naked in a graveyard. A man who was possessed by a legion of demonic spirits. They saw Jesus make this man whole again. They saw the man's desire afterwards to follow Jesus. And they heard Jesus tell him, you go and tell others what great things the Lord has done for you. They were eyewitnesses to Jesus feeding 5,000 and 4,000 people with just a little. It's important to think about this. It's important to keep this in mind as Jesus is teaching them a new lesson as we come to verse 32. Verse 32, think about Peter's response. What does he do? Well, he hears all this and he rebukes Jesus. You should laugh. He rebukes Jesus for saying that he's going to suffer, be rejected and killed. Jesus, why in the world are you saying that? You are the Messiah. Messiah. What you're saying cannot be true. Don't say that, Lord. Don't say that. Well, can't we identify with Peter? Can't we identify with why he might be saying this? Surely this will not happen to this beloved man who has power over all things. How can this happen to Jesus, the Messiah? Jesus, what you are saying is the total opposite of what we've seen with our own eyes. We watched you do the impossible. What do you mean you're going to suffer and die? You're too good. You're too great. This cannot happen to you. But as verse 33 demonstrates, Jesus is unwavering in his mission. Notice he rebukes Peter by talking to Satan. Get behind me, Satan. I think it's important for you to know that the name Satan means the adversary. The adversary. The enemy of God and all who belong to God. Peter's words, which Peter and you may have thought innocent and caring, were actually an attempt to deter Jesus from his divine mission by the adversary of God, Satan. Now, he wasn't possessed. Don't hear that. He misspoke. Jesus calls Peter Satan because that is who is being honored by Peter's words. Jesus came to die and to rise again. Notice that Jesus rebukes Peter in front of all the other disciples because of the weightiness of what is at stake in this new lesson from Jesus. And Jesus wants his disciples to know that they have been called to be disciples, followers of Jesus, and they must labor day and night to set their minds on the things of God and not on the things of man, meaning God's agenda rather than man's agenda. Followers of Jesus Christ must seek to cultivate a God-focused, Christ-centered, Holy Spirit-directed perspective on life. It's something we have to work at every single day. God's plan is the best plan, not your plan, not Terence's plan. Jesus brings his disciples to a pivotal place, a pivotal place in their discipleship about him and his mission. As a matter of fact, this is the major pivotal place in the Gospel of Mark for things turn now as Jesus sets his face towards the cross. Jesus's mission is focused and Jesus his mission is costly. The second point of our message today, Jesus's mission is costly. Look at verse 34. Jesus calls the crowd and his disciples and he gives the cost of following him. Not only does he call his disciples, but he calls the whole crowd who's been following him because he wants them to hear the call and the cost of discipleship. If anyone would come after me, if anyone would follow me, if anyone would seek to walk in the way that I walk, says Jesus, let him deny himself, take up his cross, follow me. I taught this particular verse one summer when I was in college. I was down at Pawleys Island and we were taking turns teaching our college class and I had the opportunity to deal with this particular verse and I learned a few things while I was studying for it. Following Jesus Christ will cost you and me something. It'll cost us something. The call to walk with Jesus is substantial. Take up your cross. Deny yourself, take up your cross. That's a requirement. Luke's gospel chapter 9 verse 23 says, if anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. What does it mean to take up your cross? I remember the first time, I didn't know Greek or anything like that back then I was in college, but I had my little study helps and I learned that to take up your cross means to take up your affliction. Embrace your affliction. In the early church, when they heard take up your cross, they most assuredly after Christ assuredly knew it meant prepare to be a martyr. Prepare to be a martyr. It means to embrace the hardships that accompany following Jesus Christ. Ultimately, Jesus teaches that the Christ lived life, the God word life is a life where the will of God, the truth of God, the love of God as revealed in sacred scripture becomes the center of your life and my life. Discipleship with Jesus means life is no longer only or completely about you. Amen, Holy Spirit and Bible, amen. Not brother little, amen, Bible and Holy Spirit. Life with Jesus is now such that you are willing to give up everything dear to you. Everything dear to me in life and even life itself for the sake of Jesus Christ and the gospel, which is the good news about Jesus. In verses 35 to 37, Jesus explains in more detail what it means to follow him. The self-lived life or the self-ish life means living a life divorced from the cause of Christ and the good news of Christ. That life will result in loss of life, meaning everlasting life with God. If you would follow Jesus, if you would spend your life according to the good news of the gospel of Jesus and the kingdom of God, then he says you will save your life. In the apostle Paul's letter to the Galatians, he writes, I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh, in the everyday life, he says, I live by faith, trust, dependence in the son of God who loved me and gave himself for me. These words from Jesus are chilling and I only want to read them because they really are quite self-explanatory. For what does it profit a man or a woman to gain the whole world, the entire world, all the money you've ever wanted, all the lust you've ever dreamed of? Whatever that is other than God, you've got it all to your quote-unquote heart's content. What does it profit a man or a woman to gain the whole world and forfeit or lose your soul, lose your life with God? For what can a man or a woman give in exchange for your soul? The answer is nothing, nothing. The Christ-lived life is the only true life in the world. That's the point of the whole New Testament. Life is to be lived for the Savior for the Savior who saves us out of our brokenness. I want to conclude with hopefully some perspective, perspective on answering the King's call. In verse 38, in verse 38, Jesus introduces the word shame in his explanation of discipleship. For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man, of him will Jesus be ashamed when he comes, when he returns in the glory of his Father and with the holy angels. What that means is when he returns, the next time he will return as judge. From the beginning of the earthly ministry of Jesus Christ until his return at the consummation of time and history, Jesus the King gives a call to discipleship. We call it evangelism. I like to look at evangelism, discipleship really is the same thing. But he gives the call to discipleship. In every generation, the call rings out, come, repent, turn from idolatry and sin, trust in Jesus, surrender to Jesus. He is the only savior of mankind from the sins, the shortcomings, the lawlessness of our lives. Come, come and follow Jesus. The church of Jesus Christ is composed of men, women, boys, and girls who profess to follow Jesus. Now, this is not in my notes, but I'm going to tell you anyway. One of the things I like about the definition of church, the word for it in the Old Testament and in the New, different words but same meaning. The church is the called out ones, called out of darkness, called out of a life of sin, called out of a life of rebellion to our creator and called to be the gathered body of Jesus. We confess Jesus as King and Savior and Lord and brother. To be a disciple of Jesus means we gladly associate with Jesus in every place where we have the privilege to go. It means we have no cause or reason to be ashamed or embarrassed by Jesus or his word. Amen. Amen. Amen. Y'all don't have to say it. You don't have to say it. I'll say it. Amen. Is it true of us? Are we ashamed of Jesus and his word in your homes with your adult children or your younger children who may have grown up in the church and have rejected God? Are you ashamed of the word of Jesus on your job, in the public sphere, in your neighborhood? Is it true of us? Many years ago, my family purchased a 1960s Dodge. I don't even know what model the car was. All I know is it was old. This was a 1990 to 1991, I believe. It was a four-door car where only three of the doors opened, okay? It had no AC, no defrost, no exhaust. Excuse me, it had an exhaust leak. It had an exhaust leak. It had a few missing hubcaps. It was a car, to say the least, I was very, very, very embarrassed about. I didn't put this in here, but I'm going to tell you this too. One morning, I was standing with some of the people in my neighborhood, catch the bus. Typically, my family, my parents worked out of town. They left before I left, but on this day, they left after I left. We're down, standing, and they're driving down the road. I'll never forget this. They're driving down the road, and I'm standing with these people in the neighborhood. I'm going to tell you more about them. It looks like they're waving at everybody. The people I got up with, they were just waving. As soon as they got where we were, my parents are doubled over laughing while they're driving because I told you the car didn't have any defrost. They were cleaning the window so that they could see. We lived in a community where some of the kids and the adults cared a great deal about things, stuff. This car did not measure up, in my mind, to our neighborhood's standards. When they first got the car, I didn't get in it for two weeks. I don't know how I wasn't able to get it. I didn't get it for two weeks. I tried very hard not to get in it. Sure enough, one Saturday morning, my mother said, come on, Terrence, let's go to the grocery store. Inside, I was dying. I think I put on a coat or something to try to mask myself so nobody would know it was me in the car. As we were driving up the road, I saw a young girl I went to school with, junior high school with, and I immediately ducked down as if to tie my shoes. My mama stopped the car. She reached down. This is in her young years. She reached down, grabbed me by my collar, and pulled me up. She said, son, don't ever be ashamed of what you have, for that is what the Lord has given, and that's what you have. I was undone. I was undone. I was undone. Every generation you all, until Jesus returns, has people who are adulterous and sinful. When you think of that word adulterous, what in the world, what is he talking about? God made people for God. When you see yourself or others running to other things, we have committed adultery. Against our creator, an adulterous and sinful generation, and Jesus came for them. Please don't forget that as we go into 2023. When you read the news, you watch a newspaper, you know, you arm yourselves for, you know, whatever your quote-unquote particular political party is or whatever. Do not ever forget, first and foremost, you are the church of Jesus Christ, and his kingdom matters most. Into this generation, in 2023, sisters and brothers, go out and share and teach the good news about following Jesus Christ. The people who sit in darkness desperately need to see the light of Jesus in you. They need to hear the good news of new life in Jesus in you, and through the good news that Jesus came to save sinners like you and me. Would you pray with me? Our Father, we thank you. We thank you, O God, for good news. We thank you, Lord, that you have provided a way for rebels to be reconciled, for adulterers to be purified, and for lawbreakers to be forgiven. Father, bless your church in 2023 here and across the world, and we will be found worshiping you, repenting of sin, following Jesus, sharing the good news with others. For it is in Jesus' name that we pray, amen.
