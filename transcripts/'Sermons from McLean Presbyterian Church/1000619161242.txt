Well, good morning church family and again, welcome. My name is Joe Palakis. I serve as the pastor for young adults here and it is a joy to be worshiping with you this morning. This summer. We've been going through a different psalm each week and this has been helpful because if you remember a few weeks ago when Pastor Bill kicked us off, he reminded us that the psalms give us a unique window into ourselves and into the heart of God and when I was a pastoral intern, which is what I was doing before I became a pastor here, one of my responsibilities was teaching our communicants class, which is the membership class for our sixth graders and you might have heard me talk about this before but in that class, our hope was that every sixth grader would walk away with a big view of three things a big view of God, a big view of themselves and a big view of the church and all of scripture is necessary for this, right? But I think like I said, we get a really special window into a right view of ourselves and a right view of God as we engage faithfully with the psalms and this morning we come to Psalm 61 and I hope that we will see together that a big view of ourselves necessarily includes a big view of our need and a big view of God must include a big view of his power and his protection. And so I'm going to go ahead and read Psalm 61 and then I will pray and we will dive in to the rest of our sermon. You can find it if you're looking for it on page 478 of your pew Bibles. It will also be on the screen there behind me, but I do encourage you to go ahead and get out a Bible if you don't have one and follow along because we'll be focusing on it throughout our sermon. This is Psalm 61. Hear my cry, oh God, listen to my prayer. From the end of the earth. I call to you when my heart is faint. Lead me to the rock that is higher than I for you have been my refuge, a strong tower against the enemy. Let me dwell in your tent forever. Let me take refuge under the shelter of your wings. For you, oh God, have heard my vows. You have given me the heritage of those who fear your name. Prolong the life of the king. May his years endure to all generations. May he be enthroned forever before God. Appoint steadfast love and faithfulness to watch over him. So will I ever sing praises to your name as I perform my vows day after day. This is the word of the Lord. Father, as we come to your word this morning. We ask you to open our hearts and our minds to hear and to receive what you have to say to us. Convict us, comfort us, save us. We need your help. Lead us to the rock that is higher than we are so that our souls might be satisfied and at peace. We ask these things in the name of your son, our Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen. So I wonder where do you go when you are stressed and overwhelmed? Like what coping mechanisms have you developed to give yourself a little bit of comfort when you're facing the realities of stress in your everyday life? If you live in close proximity to anybody, whether it's a roommate or a spouse or family members, you very quickly learn you very quickly learn their coping mechanisms and can be a little frustrating when the way they deal with stress isn't the same way that you deal with stress. All right, let's focus just on myself for a second. I'm very happily married to my delightful wife, Mary, and we get along pretty well, I like to think, but if I'm honest, we have very different ways of dealing with stress. So I'm not going to name names. I'll let you fill in the blanks, but let me give you just a little bit of a picture of the different ways that we respond. So one of us, when kind of stress comes and we are starting to feel overwhelmed, this person goes into hyperdrive, right? They want to do anything and everything to feel in control of the situation, right? Maybe it's tidying up the house, taking care of some errands, checking things off of a to-do list, anything, right? Just making sure that things get done. That's the way they deal with stress. The other one of us, again, not naming names, when stress comes, it's nap time, straight to bed. There's no use in dealing with anything because it's not going to get done anyways. Might as well just go to sleep. That doesn't work too well most of the time when we go very different places in the middle of stressful situations. Right, can you see how this might cause just a little bit of friction? One of us starts taking care of business, getting things done, and the other one disappears under the covers, right? Not to be seen for at least three hours, probably. Now, we're figuring out, we're learning, but again, if I'm honest, most of the time, the things that are leading to these different stress reactions are honestly relatively small, right? They're just the stress of everyday life that we all experience and try to get away from. But Psalm 61, we'll see, actually isn't too concerned with those sort of minor stresses of everyday life. Psalm 61 actually begins in a place of loneliness and desperation. See, the psalmist begins his prayer at the end of himself. And that's the point that we're going to try to get after today, or the point that we're getting at is this, right? A Christian is somebody who has come to the end of themselves and looked up. A Christian is somebody who has come to the end of themselves and looked up, and to try to justify that claim, we're going to follow the logic of the psalm, and we're going to look at that under three points. First, the posture of prayer. Second, refuge in the rock. And third, life with the king. So the posture of prayer, refuge in the rock, and life with the king. And we're going to start right where the psalmist starts in prayer, right? Look back with me at the first two verses. Hear my cry, O God. Listen to my prayer from the end of the earth. I call to you when my heart is faint. You see, this psalm begins because the psalmist is at the end of himself. And this is true, we'll see, in both the external circumstances, right, what's going on around the psalmist, but also his internal temperament, what's going on within his very heart. Just look at the language that he uses to describe himself. First, he's begging God to hear him from the end of the earth. Right? In other words, the psalmist, he's as far away as possible from the people, the things, the comforts of God. He is in exile. For David, right, who is the author of the psalm, which we learn from the title at the top, for David, this likely meant that he was far from Jerusalem, far from that special dwelling place of God where God promised to be faithful to his people. David is displaced and he's without control over his situation. But it's not just what's going on around him, right? It's not just kind of externally what's bothering him. It's the reality of his heart within him. Go back to the first part of verse two. From the end of the earth, I call to you when my heart is faint. Other translations there for the word faint use the word overwhelmed. I call to you when my heart is overwhelmed. And it's interesting, right? Because standing up here right in the pulpit, it gives me a really special, unique view into the congregation. I can see most of your faces, right? Most of you politely listening, a few fighting off some sleep, getting a little stressed, I can see. But while I might be able to see your faces, I have no special view into your hearts. From this perspective, I have no idea what's going on in your lives right now. But I do know many of you, if not, most of you have something that is either threatening to overwhelm you or has already done the job. Right, it might be an upcoming surgery this month, or maybe it's a it's a concern for one of your children's well-being. Maybe it's relationship problems with a boyfriend, a best friend. I don't know what it is. But I'm sure there's something. And I'm not sure what it is, but I am sure the thing that I am sure of is that whatever it is, you're taking it somewhere. You're doing something with it. And that's that's a question for you this morning is where are you taking your fear, your worry, your desperation? We might hide it in pleasure-seeking behavior of whatever kind, right? Pick your poison. Something anything to feel an illusion of comfort of peace. Maybe some of us take it with us to our jobs during the week so that during those few hours of nine to five, we don't have to be confronted with ourselves. But I also imagine that a lot of us actually don't end up taking these things anywhere. We just sort of try to push it down further and further into our hearts and and that might work for a little while, right? Pushing it down deeper within us. But then it seems always to erupt out of us at the slightest provocation. Right, you blow up at your kids because they got a stain on the couch. You lose it at your roommate because they left their dishes in the sink one more time. You blow up at your spouse because they forgot to defrost the chicken while you're coming home from work and you were really hoping to have dinner ready when you got home. I don't know what it is, but are you really surprised at your overreaction to these things? But just like I'm not sure what's overwhelming you right now, and although I am sure that you take it somewhere, I'm not sure where you do take it, what you do with it. But if you will look back with me at Psalm 61. Right, remembering that we're thinking about this posture of prayer that we learn. And we see that the posture of David's prayer is very different that the posture of David's prayer, it honestly reflects his external circumstances. Right, it's honest about what's going on around him and it honestly reflects what's going on in his heart. He's not just sort of gritting his teeth, smiling through the pain and ignoring it. He shouts out to God, hear me. Hear me in my loneliness, in my desperation. I'm at the end of myself. God, are you listening? Hear me when my heart is faint, when it's been absolutely overwhelmed by the uncertainty, the fear, the danger of life. Hear me, my God. But notice something else about the posture of his prayer here. Not only is he being honest about what's going on, but his prayer is upward facing. You see, David has come to the end of himself and he looks up. His cry of help rings out, lead me to the rock that is higher than I. This past week, our church hosted Vacation Bible School for nearly 300 kids every day. I'm sure some of you were there either as volunteers or as participants. I got to see a little bit of it. And if you were there or even in close proximity, you know what an ordeal it is. If you see any of our Children's Ministry staff, right, Miss Holly, Miss Emily, Miss Melanie, Miss Katie, and Miss Lydia, make sure you say thank you for all that they endured this week and all that they taught our kids. But you know, on the last day of EBS, the Bible point, right, each day there is this Bible point that the kids memorized. And the Bible point on the last day was this, and if kids, if you're here and you remember, you can shout it out. When people need help, shine Jesus's light. Nice. Most of you remember it. There'll be a pop quiz tomorrow. Don't worry. Right. When people need help, shine Jesus's light. And this is a great point. Amen, right? Because people do need help. But here's the thing. It's not just people. It's not those people over there or over there or in the back couple of rows at church. I need help. You need help. From the end of the earth, I call to you when my heart is faint, when my heart is overwhelmed. We all cry out for help in our own way. The only question is, where do you expect to find it? In this Psalm, David, he comes out of himself. He looks away from himself and he sees the rock. And this is our second point that we come to, right? To take refuge in the rock. Here's the basic message, really, of this Psalm and actually all of scripture, right? There is no true security, no true safety anywhere else besides in the living God. There is no true security anywhere else besides in God. And this Psalm, right? This prayer that David gives us, it piles up image after image after image, basically slapping us in the face with this reality, right? Look at verses 2 through 4. God is a rock, a refuge, a strong tower. He is a tent. He is a sheltering mother bird. We can consider just these first three images first in verses 2 and verses 3, the images of a rock, of a refuge, of a strong tower. We get this picture of strength, of immovability, of unyielding security. Earlier in our service, we sang, a mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing. And there is no better summary of these images. God is an impenetrable, strong tower. Right? And these images are all about security from danger, security from enemies. It's like David wants us to know that as God gathers his people in, he keeps them safe from harm. He rescues them from the flood. But something interesting happens, right, between verse 3 and verse 4, the imagery sort of shifts here. And at first glance, it looks like the security that we're hearing all about takes a radical step down, right? How is a tent stronger or safer than a strong tower? But David is actually after a sort of a different image or an enhanced image here in verse 4. If the images in verses 2 and 3, if these were primarily kind of safety oriented, as we come to verse 4, the images are all about relationship, about what covenant relationship with the living God actually looks like practically. We get a picture of intimacy that actually kind of strengthens and develops this picture of security because this tent that we see in verse 4, it's not that two-man sleeper that always seemed to spring a leak when you were camping with your kids or with your friends growing up, right? This tent is the tabernacle, the meeting, the tent of meeting, the dwelling place of God, which we first see in the book of Exodus. It's God's mobile home, if you will, the physical reminder that where God's people go, God goes. It's the place where people would meet with the living God. And so we see David has moved on from sort of declaring what God has been for him, a rock, a refuge, a strong tower, to asking God for a deeper, a wider intimacy. Right? In other words, David wants to go further up and further in to God's very goodness. But he doesn't just stop there, right? With that picture of the tent, look at that second half of verse 4. Let me take refuge under the shelter of your wings. One of the most striking images that we see in the Psalms and actually occurring throughout Scripture in the book of Isaiah and the book of Luke is God as a sheltering mother bird. As a mother bird who draws her young to herself under her wings for safety, for protection, for provision, for nourishment. And it's helpful to just stop and actually take this image seriously, right? Because what happens when we see a bird gathering her young under her wings as she comes into her nest and gathers them in, she's drawing them close to her heart. David here, as he's asking God for shelter under his wings, he's saying, God, draw me in closer and closer. I need to be by your heart. Yes, you are a refuge. Yes, you are a strong tower, but the safest place, God, I know is in your bosom. It's in your heart. So these images kind of all help us, lead us to a question. And it's this. Have you, you, have you found refuge in the rock? Because you know, God really is these things. He really is a strong tower. He really is a rock. You really can dwell in his house. He really will draw you under his wings, close to his very heart, your fears, your anxieties, your failures. You can find a safe place in him. And you've got to look up. This is the not-so-secret secret that Psalm 61 makes clear for all of us. And it starts right with the bad news that you can't come to this rock by yourself. You can't conjure up or sort of manifest this security in your own life. It comes from outside of you. In verse 2, when David cries out, lead me to the rock that is higher than I, this rock isn't just sort of a little bit higher that you need a stepstool or sort of a leg up to reach it. This rock is far above your reach. The rock that is higher than you is high and lifted up and you have no hope of reaching it by yourself. You can't. I can't. David certainly knew this that it wasn't within him to reach the rock. And if you are a Christian this morning, if that's the confession you would make, I actually would really encourage you to consider this point. I was reading earlier this week a book called Getting Out of Bed. Another hint about who goes to sleep when they're stressed. But this book on getting out of bed is actually really profound and interesting. It's by this guy named Alan Noble, who's a fellow believer and he's a professor of English at Oklahoma Baptist University. But this quote really stuck out to me. He writes this, you need to know that your being in the world is a witness and it counts for something. Your existence testifies. There is no mitigating this fact. There is no mitigating this fact. There is nowhere you can hide where your life will not speak something to the world. All we can do sometimes is to decide what our existence is a witness to, what it speaks of, and how we can share the burden of witnessing with one another. So this is why I want you to think about this if you are a believer this morning, if you are a Christian. Does your life witness to the fact that you are utterly in need, utterly dependent upon a rock on a God that is higher than you? Or do our lives witness to sort of a vague moral spirituality, right? That is actually pretty self-sustaining. Is it embarrassing for you to admit that your heart is faint? Are you a little bit uncomfortable with the language in this psalm and other psalms that seem to be a little bit too honest about their feelings? Because there's a way to do this Christian life that actually never exposes your weakness. There's a way to do this whole Christian life where, like I said, you're a bit embarrassed by what's going on here. Or do you take seriously the words that we find later in scripture in 2 Corinthians 12, the words of Jesus, where he says, my grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness. It's a great verse when you're not actually weak. Just like Psalm 61 is an awesome psalm until you've come to the end of yourself. David has no choice but to flee to the rock that is higher than he is. He has no choice but to take refuge in God because he is utterly, absolutely drained, emptied, lost, and weak. But the miraculous thing is that in David's weakness, God's power is displayed magnificently. You know, like all of this that we've been thinking through, talking through, it's pretty well and good, maybe powerful some might say, but we're still missing something. Because in everything that I've said so far, I would imagine a lot of us know that we should do this, we should act this way, and yet we find ourselves not. What happens when we don't live in a way that makes much of our weakness in order to make much of God's power, or maybe more profoundly, if you're not a Christian this morning, how can you be sure that this God can actually be a safe place for you? After all, you've got a good view up there, Pastor Joe, but you really don't know what's going on in my heart. You really don't know where I've been, what I've done, who I've been with. How can you guarantee to me that if I come to this rock, to this refuge, I won't be cast out? Those are good questions, and you should be asking them. You know, David himself, the guy who wrote the psalm, he knew something of this tension, of these questions. It's not like he's writing the psalm after a life of comfort and ease, right? Encouraging people to do something that he has never had to do in his own life. We come now to our third point, right, of life with the king, and it's important to start with David's own life. To take a moment and remember who David was and what he experienced. Because you see, David, when he was just a boy, the youngest of eight brothers, he was anointed king, but he had to wait years for that anointing to become a reality. And as he waited, it's not like he was sort of, you know, the king in waiting, driving around in limousines. He was usually on the run because the king at the time was angry that God had chosen a different king to replace him. David had to survive attempt after attempt on his own life, fleeing into the wilderness, very literally taking refuge in the crags and rocks of Israel. Eventually though, right, David is brought into Jerusalem as the only true king and he receives this incredible promise from God in 2 Samuel chapter 7. God promises that David's offspring after him, that he will be king forever. But not only that, but David's offspring, God's faithfulness and steadfast love will never depart from him. Do you hear echoes of verses 6 and 7 here in this promise? But it's not too long after David receives this promise of God's faithfulness and love that his life takes a dramatic turn. Right at the height of his kingly power and prosperity, when life is good, when he should be celebrating refuge in the rock, he commits a grievous act of adultery and sexual abuse against a woman in his kingdom, leveraging his power as a king, to take a woman who was not his wife to bed. To make matters worse, she ends up pregnant and to cover up his sin, he has her husband killed on the front lines of battle and takes her as his own wife. After being rebuked by God's prophet, things seem like they are kind of evening out, right, until later in 2 Samuel chapter 15, when David's own son, his son Absalom, revolts against him, chasing David out of Jerusalem and vowing to kill him so that he can be king. David is on the run, finding himself once again at the end of the earth, at the end of himself with nowhere to turn. And so with all of this in mind, right, with all that we are learning about David's life is, as we come to verses 6 and 7, is David only talking about himself when he exclaims, prolong the life of the king, may he be enthroned forever? Sure, he's included in that prayer. But David is looking forward because David knows a truth that many of us are too ashamed to admit of ourselves, that he is not good enough. David prays this prayer, asking for God's mercy, knowing that he falls short, and he's pointing forward, trusting in God's promise that when God says he will establish the throne of his child forever, God will do as he says. And it'll take a few hundred years, but centuries later, the same town that David came from Bethlehem, this king would be born. He arrived with not a whole lot of prestige or pomp and circumstance. He was identified, though, by angels and wise men and shepherds as the rescuer king, as the one who was long awaited. And this baby that was born would grow up. His name, spoiler alert, Jesus. And throughout the course of his life, Jesus does something interesting. He takes each of the titles that we see for God in Psalm 61, and he says, this is me. In John chapters 1 and 2, Jesus is referred to as the tabernacle, as the tent, as the very temple of God, where God dwells. In Luke chapter 13, Jesus says that he is a mother hen, yearning to draw his people close under his wings to keep them safe. In 1 Corinthians chapter 10, Jesus is called the rock. This Jesus, he claims these big, powerful titles for himself as the king, and as the king, he dies. He claims to be a strong tower, to be a refuge, to be the rock immovable, and yet he is pierced. Blood and water, as we sang earlier, pour out of him. The life of the king, the one David prayed to prolong, this life was cut off. Why? Why would the rock, the strong tower, the refuge? Why would the only perfect king, the only strong king, do something like this? The answer is in a song that I've been singing to my newborn son, that most of you have probably heard before. I'm not going to sing it. Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so. Why was the only strong tower overrun to the point of death? Because he loves you. You are precious to him. King Jesus, God himself, went to the end of the earth to draw you near. King Jesus, the rock was struck so that you might stand secure. King Jesus, the one in whom God delighted was forsaken that you could be brought into God's very heart. King Jesus, the rock was struck so that you might stand secure. King Jesus, the one in whom God delighted was forsaken, that you could be brought into God's very heart. King Jesus, who died, rose again conquering death so that this prayer could come true in real time. May he be enthroned forever. King Jesus is not dead. He lives again, reigning at the right hand of God, the Father Almighty, overruling all things for the good of those who trust in him. So what's the secret to finding refuge in this rock? You have to look up. Because he's a lot closer than you think. Let me pray for us. Our God and our Father, we're grateful for the gift of your word. Where we learn true things about you and true things about ourselves. Lord, I pray that as we live our lives, that we would be honest about our weakness. That we would take the words of Jesus seriously, that it's in our weakness that your power is made perfect. And Lord, I pray for those of us who don't know you. I pray for all of us, actually. Would you lead us again to the rock that is higher than we are? In his name we pray, amen.
