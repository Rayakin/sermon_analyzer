My name's Austin Kessel. I'm among the pastoral staff here at McLean Press. It's a delight to be with you this morning. We'll read our scripture first, and then we'll pray and launch in to our time together. Our reading today is from Revelation chapter 21. Right at the end of the Bible, Revelation chapter 21, and just verses one to four. If you're using the Pew Bibles, that's on page 1041. Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more. Neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away. This is the word of the Lord. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, as we come to you in your word this morning, we ask that by your spirit you would illuminate us, that you would wake our hearts to hear us, that you would speak to us, that you would give us in yourself a vision of life, that as your word cuts to bone and marrow, you would reveal to us lies we have held close, and more dearly, Lord, that you would show us truths that we've looked away from. Feed us, we ask, Lord, as we come to your word. In Jesus' name, amen. This week, we reach the end of a seven-week journey, well, a seven-part journey, really, over one month. It's not seven weeks. A journey through these different instances of seeing God with us. We started at the very beginning of the Bible in Genesis chapter one. We came through various stops along the way, and we've come to pretty much the final page of this book, tracing this theme of God with us through all sorts of different eras and iterations and manifestations and surprises and joys. We've seen from the moment that the piece of the Garden of Eden was shattered by Adam and Eve's choice to call him a liar. We've seen God pursue mankind and lead them out of their own mess. We've seen his irrepressible love drive through history. We've seen him come again and again through the barriers of sin and evil to relentlessly pursue his people. We saw him guide a fledgling nation out of slavery with pillars of fire and cloud through the wilderness when they had no idea where they were. We've seen him guard his people with his presence, even in a fiery furnace in exile, where they were because of their sin, and yet he went with them. We've seen him guard his people by going with them wherever they went, keeping promises through thousands of years of a single family line through Abraham to David and to the infant crib in the manger. We've seen him bring kind of lost foreigners like me, lost foreigners to the manger with covenant people to kind of confusedly but delightedly worship the Lord Jesus together. You see this drive through the whole of the narrative of scripture, God coming ever closer, ever more with us, taking on flesh and blood, coming to be here intimately. That's what we sang about last week, this wonder that God would not stay distant, that his relentless pursual of us wouldn't finish halfway, but he would come all the way to flesh and blood and a lifetime with us and death and resurrection. These are the things we've been rejoicing in. And yet, if we're honest, we'd have to say we'd be lying if the hope of Christmas on its own wipes away every tear. Because since we sang together last week, it may well be that even among us, we've walked through some of the worst of life. Whether it's been directly in this last week or we bear the memory that we cannot shake of what has been and what we fear will be. And that the manger can feel as far away in time and space as that hope. That hope can feel, yes, I ought to feel that. I know that is true, and yet there is longing, there is missing, there is pain, there is ugly reality. And that's what draws us further on because the Bible doesn't finish at the end of the Gospels. It carries on. It carries on, and we have this section at the end of the Bible from Hebrews through to Revelation that we call, terribly excitingly, the general epistles. And these are letters written to Christians living after Christmas, living after the resurrection, and living in the kind of reality we find ourselves in, waiting for the Lord Jesus to come. When these letters were first written, these were Christians looking at the ruins of Jerusalem, looking at a temple destroyed and abandoned after the Romans sacked it in AD 70. Christians for whom the hope that Christ might come back immediately had evaporated. Christians looking at a complex world even with the hope of Christmas, even with the reality of the resurrection. And these letters teach us as they taught them how to live as Christians in between those things. Knowing the hope is true and seeing what we see every day, longing for what's to come. Because what we see here in Revelation is what will be. It's what we pray for in the Lord's Prayer when we pray, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. That's what we saw in those verses we just read. Heaven and earth coming together with the separation completely removed. No distance anymore. God's throne room brought down into the midst of his people. No need for any sun anymore because the glory of the Lord is so bright. The immediacy of his presence is right there. This is what the answer to your prayer looks like when you pray that. And it's shown in the passage as a city, as a new Jerusalem. So people who've just witnessed the again destruction of their hopes and their city, the again destroying of the hopes that they dared raise. This passage says, look, we're not just rebuilding what was. We're not just rebuilding Jerusalem. We're not even just going back to the garden and we can just pretend all of this never happened. We're not going backwards, we're going forwards. Not to what was, but to what was promised. To what has been a pulsating promise through the whole of scripture that God will not only bring us back, but we will have something so wonderful. This image of this city, this presence, this togetherness, this immediacy of life with God. It's the kind of place where the greatest introvert will love to be among all those people. Like just the most gorgeous wedding you'd love to be at. Even as an introvert. The place that the biggest extrovert will never want to leave and seek a bigger adventure. Or new people. This city where God himself permeates everything with his glory. But as things we long for and pursue are genuinely present and immediate. There's no more sea, that's Bible language for no more chaos or separation. But what is there if there's no more sea? Verse three gave us our favorite little Greek word from our series together. I wonder if you remember Pastor Bill. He's the really clever one. Told us about this word that comes up when we're talking about the tabernacle. Skene, Greek word, skene. And when you get to John chapter one and that incredibly pivotal verse in salvation history, chapter one verse 14 of John's gospel. It says the word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. The word, Jesus Christ, the eternal word. Became flesh and made his dwelling among us. That word made his dwelling among us is that word tabernacle, skene. The word made his tabernacle among us. That same presence that God deliberately put among his people to travel with them is the word that John chooses to describe what happens in the incarnation. And it comes up again when he says and he will dwell with them. The verb is skenosai. You could read this whole verse like this. Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men and he will tabernacle with them and they will be his people. You see how at the end of the narrative as we come through the whole thing, he is saying look, this theme is still the theme. Don't miss it. The same words we've been using to describe God's intention towards his people. They run to the very end, into eternity. His words describe his heart towards us to dwell among, to remove separation, to be with. His relentless pursuit of tabernacling with his people, making a permanent unguarded dwelling with his people. It's God eternally with us, face to face in that city. I wonder if through this series at times you felt like, okay great, the thought of God with us does sound wonderful, but it also sounds like there might be some pros and cons. Right, like I gotta be on my best behavior. A little like the idea of your mother-in-law moving into your basement. It's gonna be great with the childcare, the food's gonna improve, the food's gonna improve. Pros and cons. Pros and cons. Sharon, I know you're watching. I love you, you know that. Pros and cons, right? That might be how we picture it. And yet, if this is true about who God is, this is not just a kind of pros and cons, like maybe it'll be great, maybe it won't. This is a life worth hoping for. This is life in its fullness, life that is truly life. Not something we might weigh up, but something we, if we start to grasp it, if the Spirit opens our eyes to see it, we should be jumping at. And we can be, seeing that this kind of life is everything we long for. And if it's a life worth hoping for, it's a hope worth living for. If we're gonna live lives as Christians, amidst all the mess of now, then Christmas has to be more than just an annual festival of fuzzies, excitement, that kind of thing. We have to put some legs on where we're going, and where things go after this. If it's gonna be a life-altering reality, we need to see that life face-to-face with God is not pros and cons. It is a wonderful, beautiful hope that's worth living for. So we'll think about those two things, a life worth hoping for and a hope worth living for. First of all, this kind of eternal life genuinely is a life worth hoping for. I think it's important to dwell on this, because we can lose hope with life. We can imagine that it couldn't truly be what we long for, that those things we long for were childish. The way we wish life were is naive. I want to encourage you this morning. There is a life worth hoping for. It's begun, and it will be utterly fulfilled, because God is the reward himself, and we will be with him. We spoke earlier about, John was mentioning the church as the bride of Christ. You see that in Revelation 21, that how does God describe us on that last day? I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. The church forms this new city. The people called out of darkness, called out of a mess, get called his bride. Beloved, the most beautiful thing you can imagine. And for the bride, the reward, we know this, right? We joke about this in our culture, but the reward isn't the wedding. The reward is the with, right? It's the with, it's being with the husband. And again, we kind of knock on shadows to make some, you know, with our marriages here, and we long for it to be what this is, and yet, what God is describing about eternity is the fulfillment of that. That the with is the reward, that being with God himself is going to be, in itself, the great delight. When you come to God, you come to God for himself. And there are blessings, and there's good vibes, and there's all that kind of stuff, but honestly, that's kind of like the oxygen in this room. Like, isn't it wonderful there's oxygen in this room? But I doubt that's why any of you came here today, right? So with the blessings and the goodness that come, we don't come to God for those things. They're wonderful, fantastic, but we come to him for himself. And that, if we understand that, will completely transform how we think about eternity and how it changes now, if God himself is the reward. Ask yourself this. In your universe, in my universe, am I the sun with God, a planet, circling around me, occasionally coming into view? And when he does, I, ah, he's beautiful. When he does, there's a moment of connection with the transcendence. Or am I like a planet to the sun, circling around, dependent for all life, for everything, for warmth, for sustenance, for everything on this sun? If I was cut off from God, would I lose just kind of a satellite to my existence? Or would I lose everything? Would I, if I was cut off from God, would I miss out on some optional beauty and moments of comfort? Or do I face a choice between life and flourishing and enjoyment and relationship? Or the torment of choosing death and lifelessness when life has been relentlessly offered? Choose life. You're not the sun. God is not your cosmic therapist, your galactic florist, giving you the most beautiful things and disappearing into the background. Life without him is no life at all because as the Bible relentlessly tells us, he is our life. As we get to be with him, we find our life. So when he comes to be with, it's time to clear the calendar. Redraw those priorities. Because what we're talking about is this dark choice that's been underlying this whole story, that God is utterly with us on the one hand if we come to Christ, or we are utterly without God. There's the choice, God utterly with us or us utterly without God. No middle ground. Verse eight talks about this. We cut down a little bit below our passage. 21 verse eight, it says, but as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death. If you reject Christ and choose to carry on your own sin unforgiven, you face this kind of radical judgment, this characterization by your own evil. But if you come to him, then not one of these things gets to tell you who you are anymore. There's mercy for you. Perhaps you have murdered. Maybe you've been involved with the occult and things you know are deeply evil. There's mercy for you. A future free of those stains, the lies you've told, the sexual immorality you know far better than you wish you did. They stay nailed to the cross as you are risen and called beautiful and a worthy bride. You're a coward. Of course you are. You're faithless. Yes, you lie, you worship false gods. All these things happen. And yet you come to the God who gives you a life worth hoping for because this is the God who can change those identities. And we see that in verse four. Look at it. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes and death shall be no more. Neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore. For the former things have passed away and all the deepest grief of this life will be comforted in the face of God. That is true. That is wonderful. But don't miss the action of how this happens in verse four. That verb. The verb at the beginning of verse four is translated wipe away. That, I'm gonna give you one more piece of Greek. Sorry about that. The verb is exalepsy. It's formed out of the prefix ex, out of, from, away from. And the verb elapse, to anoint. So you could translate this word that God will un-anoint every tear. You see the beauty there. The God who anoints, who has sent messengers throughout history to anoint prophets and kings. To perform this identity ritual upon people. Here un-anoints us from our tears. You see how profound this is that as he wipes away your tears, he not only dries away your tears to weep once more, but he takes the salt water and replaces it with what we see in verse six. The springs of living water. That death is gone. He'll no longer be a child of sorrows. In his divine goodness, he speaks this word over you and the man of sorrows, who is familiar with sufferings, heals the sorrows and sufferings we know. It's not what we long to do for one another, to not only comfort but heal. To wipe away the tear and actually be able to make a difference. And he does. He's bought every moment of pain with his blood so that he doesn't only comfort, he does comfort, he does amen, but he heals. He's the alpha and the omega, the objective correlative of the desires that we cannot even begin to understand within ourselves. It will be wonderful to be free of all that pains us. Absolutely. But it'll be so much better, even than that, to be with the God who showers us with love, with purpose, with rejoicing, with delight. The greatest joy and amazement we can hope for isn't just the removing of those things and the giving of blessings, but the immediate, eternal, never gonna be taken away presence of God himself. Because Christ, God with us, is the reward. Not only incarnate, not only by his spirit, and it is wonderful that he is with us by his spirit, and yet that day we will see not in a mirror dimly anymore, but face to face. No confusion, no misunderstanding, no wish I knew him better. Eternal life like that is a life worth hoping for, and in Christ that hope's guaranteed. You come to Christ, that's yours. He'll be with us, and he will have us with him. If it's a life worth hoping for, it's a hope worth living for. We have to ask ourselves the question, if that is what is truly coming, how does that change today? What difference does it make? The theologian Michael Allen, talking about Jesus' parable of the treasure in the field that he tells in Matthew chapter 13, where a man sells everything he has to buy a field because he knows there's a treasure in it. He says this, when we assess the worth, beauty, and goodness of the treasure hid in the field, then, and only then, do we joyfully sell all we have to buy that field. And throughout the Gospels, you hear Jesus teaching that, right? That if we grasp what it is that he offers, when he's talking about the kingdom of God, the kingdom of heaven, all these things, if we understand what that is, then our lives today radically change. All our priorities are reordered. And perhaps you've seen simplistic approaches to this. The fresh zeal of a new believer who acts like the Gospel now makes life simple. Or the well-intentioned, kind of, the Christians who haven't yet been tested. Or they have been tested, but someone's arrived very quickly to bail them out. Perhaps you've seen this and thought, yes, but life is complex. I cannot simply just reorder everything around heaven. But those general epistles that I mentioned earlier, from Hebrews through to Revelation, they're not naive. They're not naive. Hebrews 10, verses 23 to 25, sums up the posture of those letters as they look ahead with hope through a difficult presence. Hebrews chapter 10, verses 23 to 25 say this. Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promises is faithful. And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another. And all the more as you see the day drawing near. That day is the day when heaven comes down to earth. And Christ, triumphant, comes for his bride. It's no mock horror rapture. This is the unmistakable triumphant remaking of all things with Christ on the throne. The glory of God so bright that, like we said, there's no need for the sun anymore. The delight of all nations as close and as tangible and as obvious as this room. But in the meantime, we live for the hope that that will come. Listen to Hebrews again from chapter 12. Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight and sin which clings so closely. And let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God. Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted. The expectation that these letters clearly give us is that living life as a Christian is a life of endurance. Not ease. Not the comfortable way out. We need one another, we need the encouragement of meeting together, building one another up, sending one another on, bearing burdens together. The expectation is that if we open our eyes and understand the wonder of our hope, then we'll live for it today. And then that will make life more complicated. If he opens our eyes to see how good and beautiful eternity with him is, then a life of endurance, of casting off sin, of embracing choices that leave us weary, that leave us fainthearted, becomes not only plausible, but the only satisfying way to live. So let me ask you, does your life as a Christian leave you getting to Sunday, just needing to be back with God's people? Because life has left you weary. Well done, well done. You're living life, this is true. Does your life following Christ delight you and make the pleasures of the earth seem kind of brittle and thin? That's good. It's really good. He's begun to do the work of opening your eyes because those things cannot begin to imitate the true glory you've begun to see. And so they start to fade. And don't hear me saying that the world is bad. It's almost a point. There are wonderful things in this world that the Lord has created and said they're very good. And yet those things are kind of paper creatures that remind us of the real thing. And as we enjoy them, we enjoy them all the more as we see through them to the reality they remind us of. That the goodness, the beauty, the things worth our time and investment, the relationships, all these things, they are good and they are so much better when we understand them by looking through them to eternity, to glory, to the God who created those things and gives them to us. Praise Jesus. If it all seems a little bit much to you, I get that. But let me invite you to pray. Let me invite you to pray to him, speak to God. Ask the Lord to make the things of this world seem thin and papery in the light of his glory. He's gentle and he's patient. Ask him to delight your soul with himself. To make other things fade, not because they're bad, but because they're so good. Ask him to convince your heart that his promises are true. To guide you to live today like this is a hope worth living for. He's gentle and he's patient. He's proven that for thousands of years. He's shepherded his people through so many things and generations will testify to that. That he will take care of you and guide you to that day. That's a hope worth living for today. Speak to him, ask him to extend the boundaries of your imagination beyond the here and now. To what truly is. That you might glorify and enjoy him today as you will in eternity. Eternal life in the city of God with him face to face. It's a life worth hoping for and a hope worth living for. As we finish, think about this. God himself, the reality behind all reality, the ground of all being, absolute personality and love itself, the creating and sustaining God has revealed himself, has made himself known, has come to be with us. He's waded through time and history to make that goal a reality. He has bound up brokenness and sin in scarred arms of love. He has done everything that we might have everything. Long for him, come to him, he is in himself everything that your heart races for. Even when it's been a little while since your heart raced. He's longed for you to come to him. He'll never let you go, he'll never let your sin be too much for his grace. Come, repent and believe the good news. Let's pray. Heavenly father, open our eyes, work by your spirit. We cast ourselves in your grace knowing that we would know none of this if you weren't kind to be with us and reveal it to us. Lord, would you do that work in our hearts of convincing us the truth of who you are of who we are and how deeply you have loved us. We pray it in Jesus name, amen.
