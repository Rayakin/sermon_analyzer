Good morning, church family. It's good to see you this morning. Also, good morning to folks joining us at our Herndon site virtually. It's good to not see you, but to be with you and know that you're there worshiping with us. Before we start, just a couple updates. First of all, you'll be hearing more about this in the days and weeks to come, but we are making some adjustments to our worship schedule. Over the last few months, for the last six months, we've been trying to keep a close eye on how this room feels in the morning. If you are a morning person, or maybe not a morning person, but a morning service person, you've noticed it's become more and more cramped, which is a very encouraging problem to have. As we've been thinking about options, we've decided that after Easter, we will be reinstating the fellowship hall service at nine o'clock. If you were here before 2020, this will be familiar to you. This is a service that's the same service as this service with a liturgy leader, same worship songs, folks leading worship there. The sermon here will be live streamed into the nine o'clock service, three Sundays out of the month. The other will be live preaching. We're excited to be able to make some more room. We are beyond what we call comfortable seating capacity. What that means, practically speaking, is not only that you're getting to know each other better, that's good, but it also means that when we have new people coming, it is increasingly difficult to make them feel welcome, even to find a place to sit. We want to make room for people to come and hear about Jesus and experience the fellowship here. That change will happen after Easter. We normally have that service at the Easter service because we definitely need it then. We'll just continue it after that as well. Thank you for your patience with that. We'll be sharing more information about how you can be engaged in helping us make that a success as we communicate it with you. At the same time, we are going to discontinue the 515 evening service. A couple reasons for that. Just as we've monitored attendance across our services, that has continued to be a fairly low attendance service. That's not the only reason that we think it might be time for a change. Also, we recognize that Sunday night is a rare opportunity for discipleship, not just for our children who often meet on Sunday night and our students who often meet on Sunday night, but also for the rest of you. We want to make some more room, be good stewards of our time and resources to create new discipleship opportunities on Sunday night. You'll be hearing more about that. Again, those changes will take place the Sunday after Easter. For some of you, it's probably not going to affect you a whole lot. For others of you, it might feel like a really big change and even like some measure of loss. We get that. We did not make this decision carelessly or too quickly, too rationally. We've been praying about it and thinking and talking about it together as leadership. If you have questions, please ask. You've got time to ask questions and for us to help you make this decision more smooth and help you figure out what would be a good situation for you and for your family here at McLean. That's the one announcement. The other is really just an update personally. Thank you to many of you who have been praying for a few of us who were in Togo, West Africa last week for a week. Matt Stone, our Director of Missions, Justin Gentry, one of our pastoral interns and I were visiting our missions partners in Togo. Nathaniel, Pastor Nathaniel, will be here at our missions conference. You can see a picture of him on the back of your bulletin. He was our tour guide. He made sure that we didn't get sick the entire time, which is amazing, but he also made sure that we had an opportunity to see many of the things that this congregation has been involved in for over 25 years in Togo. More recently, this church has been involved in giving toward a seminary facility that is just finishing up. We're able to look and see it and hear about the work that that seminary is going to do, not only for pastors in Togo, but all over the region in West Africa. Not only that, we actually met members of congregations you helped feed during COVID. If you remember, some of the money that you gave generously to COVID went overseas for folks who were struggling, really on the poverty line. We were able to talk to moms and dads and even kids who were helped directly by the gifts that you gave. It was amazing. I will say the music, the worship in Togo is a little more lively than it is here, so I have to get used to that, but that too was a good little adjustment of my Western mindset of what worship is all about. It was amazing to worship with them and to see the love of Christ at work in their hearts and to be able to call them brothers and sisters in Christ. I'm excited for you to hear, not just from Nathaniel, but other Missions partners at our Missions Conference. If you can make it or any part of it, you should come. You should come. It'll be amazing. Folks have put tons of work into making it a really value-added time for your own perspective on what God is doing. Something else I did in Togo, I streamed the service. It was a little spotty, the Wi-Fi in the hotel, but I was able to make out most of the service last week and worship with you that way. It wasn't the same, but I was able to watch Pastor Terrence's excellent sermon last week on diversity. I hope you were as encouraged and challenged by it as I was as we continue in this series on Genesis, the true and better story. We've been thinking about different aspects of what it means to be a human being each week through the lens of Genesis. Last week, as I said, we looked at diversity. Before that, dignity. We've looked at sexuality. We've considered other issues that are the kinds of conversations that we are having in this cultural moment. Today, I want us to think and talk about work and what Genesis 1 and 2 tells us about work. We have a complicated relationship with work. I'll speak for myself, but I think I can safely say for all of us, we have a complicated relationship with work. Some of us love our jobs. Some of us detest our jobs. Some of us come home from work and we're energized because it gave us a deep sense of meaning. Others of us come home from work and we scream into the pillow at night because it's not energizing. It's exhausting, and we're wondering, what in the world are we doing? And then not only are our experiences different in those ways, also just think about the spectrum of work that's being done in this room. Not just the different fields that all of us are engaged in—engineering and medicine and law and teaching and raising kids at home and everything in between— we have students here. Some are in elementary school. You're not thinking about quite yet what you're going to be when you grow up. Maybe you did that in kindergarten, but you're not really seriously thinking about it. Even junior high, high school, you're beginning to think more about that. College, maybe a little more. And then you have folks in this room who are retired. You're not figuring out what you're going to do when you grow up. You're like, what do I do now that I'm grown up and I don't have work to do? For some of us, that's a really pressing question. And then there's lots of us who are in between, trying to figure out if the job we're in now is the job we're going to be in forever, if this is what we should do, if we should make a change, if we're going to take the promotion. These are all questions that we don't leave at the door in the car when we come to church. At least we shouldn't. Those are the questions. Those are the real questions that we bring into this room because we have a complicated relationship with work. And what I want to do this morning is not to give you exhaustive answers to those questions, or even to give you an exhaustive theology of work. And part of the reason why I feel liberated from having to do that is because lots of other people have done that before me. In the last 20 or 30 years, there has been an explosion of really, really helpful resources related to faith and work, even in this own church. So, we have our Fellows Program, which is really dedicated in many ways, a discipleship program, but also one that allows our fellows to wrestle with these questions about what it means to be a Christian and to be whatever it is God is calling them to be. We also have resources that folks in this church have published on the topic. I grabbed two that I was looking at this week off my shelf. This is our own Hugh Walsh's book, How Then Should We Work? It's an excellent resource. I've also mentioned to you Dan Doriani's book on work, Work, Its Purpose, Dignity, and Transformation, also excellent. And I could bring up five or six or 60 other books, podcast articles that do a great job helping you think through what it means for you, wherever God has called you, to do your work well. So, I'm not going to spend a lot of time helping you work through those questions because I feel like I can offload those to people who will say it better than I ever could say it. What I really want to wrestle with, though, is the experience of work and how it is that we account for the experience of work. Because you will spend far more time at work than you will spend in church. And work will bring you some of your deepest joys and some of your biggest frustrations. And the question is, how do we account for that? What story do we tell ourselves that accounts for the role that work plays in our lives? Whether you're currently working, or you're looking for work, whether you're done working, or you're just starting to think about work, whether you love your work or hate your work, how is it that God would have us consider this complicated relationship that we have with work? I think Genesis 1 and 2 gives us all kinds of things to think about that I want to think about with you this morning. So, let me pray as we open God's Word together. Father, we pray now that you would be so gracious as to open our eyes that we might see wonderful things in this portion of your Word. We ask it in Jesus' name. Amen. So, I want to talk about three things this morning. The purpose of work, why it is that we work, the problem with work, why is work so hard, and the power for work. Where do we go from here? Let's begin with the purpose of work. If you haven't already asked the question in your life, at some point you will ask the question, why am I doing this? Why am I giving so much time and energy, emotional, physical energy to this job, career, to this work? What is the point of all of it? And our world doesn't hesitate to answer that question for you in a couple different ways. The modern secular story, the modern story of what it means to be a human being would say, well, work is fundamentally utilitarian. In other words, it's a means to an end. And so, our world tells us the reason that you work is that you can make money so you can buy stuff. Because when you buy more stuff, you can be more comfortable and be more happy. Or the world says, actually, no, the purpose of work is self-actualization. Like, work is where you discover who you really are. Like, why the universe put you where he put you, it put you, and the difference that you will make in the world. And not only for other people, just for yourself, to discover yourself. Now, there's truth to both of those stories. I mean, we do need to work in order to provide for ourselves. That's a good thing. And it's also true that we derive meaning from our work. And as we'll see, that's a good thing too. But I would suggest that story doesn't fully account for the experience that we have of work. Actually, I think the story that Genesis 1 and 2 tells us more fully accounts for the purpose of work. We didn't read this verse, but it's implicit in these verses. And we've read it the last couple of weeks. If you just back up a couple of verses to verse 26, we're told in Genesis 1-26 that we are made in God's image. It's interesting that comes at the end of chapter 1, which is a chapter that basically explores God at work as a craftsman, as a builder, as one who is the architect of all things. And at the end of that chapter, when He creates the first man and first woman, He declares that He is making them in His image. So it only makes sense that part of what it means to be made in the image of God is to be made as someone who works, as a creature who has this innate desire to have agency in the world, to make something meaningful, to create, or in our case, sub-create, take God's creation and make things, create things, organize, help, serve. The language, maybe the job description you might say, of human beings is given to us in verse 28, and God blessed them and God said, be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion. Sadly, both Christians and non-Christians have understood this language of subduing and having dominion as somehow God giving permission for human beings to exploit His world, to use it only to serve their own ends and not to serve others. That's not what those words mean. In fact, if you want to keep reading, when you look at verse 15, the way it's described in the life of Adam in the garden is he was put there to work it and to keep it. The word there is actually to protect, in the sense that God gives Adam and Eve the commission to cultivate the good world He has made, to bring out the full potential in the world He has made. Think, for example, about guitars. God did not create a world in which guitars grow on trees, but He made trees and He made animals that have intestines that can make strings, and the trees provide wood to make the body of the guitar and maybe the pegs of the guitar, and He made human beings with fingers that allow them to form chords and voices and vocal chords that let them create melodies. Honestly, after today, I would say some better voices than others. That's okay. You know, we sing joyfully to the Lord no matter what He's given us. He's given us in creation all the potential to write beautiful music on beautiful instruments, but that comes about through the creative energy of those who bear His image, and that doesn't just apply to guitars. That applies to medicine and iPhones and skyscrapers and everything else. Like, the world that, in a sense, we have made is a reflection of the fact that we are made in God's image who made all things, and that instinct to have agency to create, to do something meaningful in the world is God-given and ought to be celebrated and affirmed in every way, understanding that that is also meant to be aimed in a certain direction. So, a moment ago, we sang a song which called us as human beings to fill the earth with songs of worship. Now, normally, we would say, oh, that means that we're supposed to go out and sing hymns and songs out in the world so people know Jesus, and I would say, sure. But this idea of worship very much captures what we're being told here in Genesis chapter 1, that your life ought to be a song of worship, your work ought to be a song of worship, that your vocation is doxology. You see, the fact is, you can take a guitar and you can either use it to bring glory to God and serve other people by uplifting them and helping them explain their experience as human beings made in God's image in ways they are creative, or you can use a guitar in a very different way to write other songs that do just the opposite. The same goes for the iPhone. Some of you looked up the verse this morning on your iPhone. You can read Scripture from anywhere in the world, including in Togo, I found out, on your iPhone, or listen to podcasts, or call a neighbor or a friend who desperately needs to hear your voice or see your face. That's amazing technology. But that same technology can be used for evil, to look at images that are self-destructive to us and tell us lies about our sexuality, to invite falsehood and deceit into our lives, right? Like, the direction matters as well. And so we would say, all work is good work when done to the glory of God and for the good of our neighbors. This is why theologians describe verse 28 as the cultural mandate. So before God says through Jesus in Matthew chapter 28, go and make disciples of all nations, he says in Genesis 1, go be fruitful and multiply, subdue the earth and have dominion over it. Go do good work. Now, the reason I'm camping out here just for a couple minutes is not to give you exhaustive answers as to like, well, then what does that mean for my work? This is where there's lots of resources I can help you sort through that question. It is to say to you, rather, that Genesis actually explains our complicated relationship with work very well. In a way that the modern world doesn't. And I would even say, in a way that the church often doesn't. So, the modern world has its false narratives, utilitarian, self-actualization that don't tell the whole story, but the church often doesn't tell the whole story when it comes to your work either. So, as a pastor, I'll just own this for all other pastors and churches that have pulled this move, but the false narrative that the church often tells you is that there's really important work, like missionary work and preaching and evangelism, okay? Really important work. And then there's ordinary work, you know, the stuff you all do. Kind of convenient that I do all the important work and you do all the rest of it, but actually, we as Christians often go one step further, and what we say is actually, the ordinary work is really important because you make money to give to the really important work. Or, if we're feeling, you know, especially frisky around the missions conference, the reason you do your work is as a platform to tell people about Jesus, evangelism. Now, is giving to the work of the kingdom important? Absolutely. Is evangelism important? Absolutely. But what that does is it unnecessarily, and I would say unbiblically divides spiritual work from secular work. And I hope you see right here in Genesis 1, that dualism is erased. And we've talked about this, the dualism between the spiritual being really good and the material not so good, that too is erased, that we are made as those in God's image to bear his image in all things, including in our day-to-day work. So, the purpose of work, your work is important. Your call, your vocation to work is not the only vocation on your life, but it's an important vocation that God has given you. So, what's the problem with work? Well, let me just say this, it ain't work. Work's not the problem because here it is in Genesis 1 in a world before sin that Adam and Eve are working. So, it's not work, the problem, I have to explain the problem some other way. Now, I'm asking that question, what's the problem with work? Because that's the question you and I are asking all the time. And the question usually goes something like this, after a long day or Thursday at 2.15 or 3.58, you know, and you're asking like, why is this so hard? It should not be this hard. Or, why is this so boring? Like, can I please do anything else than sit in this meeting right now? Or, do I have to do another spreadsheet? Some of you are like, spreadsheets, that's my love language. Other people are like, do I have to do another, you know what I mean? It's like that feeling of like, why is this so hard? You with me? Why is this so hard? The answer is not, well, because work is bad. No, the answer is twofold. First of all, because sin has effects on everything. You know, we just said that there's not a dualism or distinction between the secular and the sacred as if sin just affects the spiritual. Like, sin affects everything. That's how we ought to read Genesis chapter three, which we'll get to eventually, but I'm going to skip ahead just to show you verse 17, that one of the consequences of Adam and Eve deciding, you know, I'm going to make life work without God and turn my back on him and rebel against him and do exactly what he told me not to do. One of the consequences of that rebellion is the corruption of work. So, we read in verse 17 that God says to Adam, cursed is the ground because of you. In pain you will eat of it all the days of your life. Thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you. Just think about this image for a second. He's talking about literal thorns and thistles infesting the ground, right? And so, imagine the complicating effects of thorns and thistles when you're trying to do good farming or good gardening. Some of you know this better than the rest of us, like clearing out the weeds. Even thorns and thistles has this idea of like, they're out to get you. You know, when you walk through thistles and you have shorts on, maybe you have sandals on, they're all getting stuck in your foot. You have to take them out and they get stuck in your finger and you can't get them off, right? Just annoying, frustrating, painful. So, now what's being described is not just the way that sin affects agriculture, but the way it affects work. Because like a jammed copier, when you're five minutes from the meeting, feels like a thistle that you can't get out of your finger. Like, why does it have to break now? Why do I have to spend two hours on the phone with the IT guy just to get my computer working? And on the other side, the IT guy is, why do I have to spend two hours on the phone with this person who doesn't know how to use a computer, right? Like, why does it have to be this hard? And not just those annoyances, but just the heartbreak and the antagonism of office politics, you know, and bosses who take all the credit and none of the blame, and clients who are perpetually ungrateful, and on and on. I don't need to tell you all of this. You brought all of that frustration in and you're going to take it all the way back out. But what I want to give you is an understanding of where that comes from. It comes from the intrusion of sin and the way that it affects all things. And it doesn't help that every organization everywhere consists only 100% of sinners. See, that doesn't help the situation either. Up and down the org chart, a bunch of sinners. And you just know the way that's going to go. Now, on the other hand, people made in the image of God. And so what you get is you get a lot of beauty and goodness and a lot of brokenness all mixed in. The second reason we have a problem with our work, it's not just the intrusion of sin, sort of in that noetic sense, in that comprehensive sense, but also the idolatry of our hearts. I wish we had time to do a little Bible study on Genesis chapter 11. But if you were to flip over to Genesis chapter 11, you find the Tower of Babel story, which I will just summarize as a story of work gone wrong. Because here you have these very skilled, very smart, very creative people who say in the city, let's build a tower, not for the glory of God, not to serve our neighbor, but why? To make a name for ourselves. Ah, and there you have it. There you have the warping of work from an act of worship to the God who made us to an act of worship of ourselves. The idolatry of making your work your primary source of identity and security and significance. Now, look, I already said, because of the way we're made, work ought to bring a sense of significance and identity. There's nothing wrong with that. I'm saying, primary source of identity and significance and security. And that's what idolatry is. It's substituting what only God can give you. It's substituting for God something in the created world and looking to those things for security and significance and worth. I had this really fascinating conversation with a pastor in Togo. We're standing in the church that he had helped start, and we were in a part of Togo that was dominated. These villages around this church were dominated by traditional African religion, which we would understand as idol worship. And so I asked him, I said, do you have people in your church who come to church on Sunday and worship Jesus and then go home and worship their idols? He goes, oh yeah, I have a lot of them. And I said, well, what's keeping them from throwing all their idols away and just worshiping Jesus? He said, fear. Fear that if they were to do that, they would lose the protection of whatever gods they're worshiping, and that those gods would lash out against them and bring sickness and danger into their lives. It's fear. And so I said, that's really interesting. So I got back in the car, and we're driving back down the road, and I said to Nathaniel, you know, he just said to me, that's what I'm dealing with, like in my own heart, but also with my own people. The problem isn't any different. The idols are different, but the problem's not any different. What's the reason that we cling to our work or whatever our idol of choice might be? It's fear, like if I let go of this, I'm not confident God will give me what I need. And some of you this morning, you just need to hear this. There's a difference between sacrificing for your work, which all of us must do, and sacrificing everything for your work. And some of you right now are in a season of life where you are sacrificing your health, your family, your integrity, your walk with the Lord for your work. Again, there are seasons of life in which you have to lean into your work, right? Like if you're an accountant, when it's tax season, sorry, like you're just not going to save money. Or if you're in the military and it's time for a deployment, that's just part of the deal. If you're a teacher and you're the track coach, like track season, you're just not around, okay? We need to acknowledge that and say, that's just, that's part of life. But there comes a point at which those sacrifices are far too much. And we begin sacrificing what's most important for things that are not most important. And then what happens is we begin to medicate and self-medicate when we get in those places of stress and anxiety with pornography and with substance abuse and with, in other ways, workaholism. And we get to a place in which we're not really working out of a sense of joy to serve the Lord, but we're working because we're desperately afraid that this is our only source of meaning and significance. See, for some of us, that's the problem with work. And we need to take a hard look at our hearts. So it raises the question, what do you do? Not just if you're in that place of idolizing your work, but all of us in all the complicated places we find ourselves. Well, it's a challenge to say a couple things that would apply to everybody, but let me give it a shot. First of all, I would just remind you and encourage you with this. The good news of the gospel is that your work is not your primary identity. We live in a town in which the first question people ask after you meet them is, what do you do? That's a fine question. People typically come here at some point to work, and many people have really important jobs. And so it's a fine question to ask. And yet if we let that question nag at us a lot, we may begin to really believe that who we are is what we do. And the gospel says, actually, no. Your identity is not grounded in what you do. It's grounded in what Jesus has done for you. That Jesus came to rescue you from sin and death and hell and to reconcile you to your heavenly father and to renew you more and more in his image every day through the Holy Spirit. And to promise you in eternity with him in the new heavens and the new earth. That's your identity. Actually, it's that identity that frees us up to work well, to be free to fail from time to time and take risks and love people and make decisions that may not be best for our career, but it's best for our family. So your work is not your primary identity. And then secondly, I would just remind you that your work is not your greatest legacy. And that one's not going to go down easy with you, I know. You know, because we have this idea of like, no, the most important thing I'm doing and I will ever do in my life is the legacy I leave behind in my career. And for some of you, you will leave behind a more impressive legacy than the rest of us. I'm pretty sure of that. But the work that I do as a pastor and have done for a couple decades now includes officiating funerals. And I can tell you that I've never been to a funeral in which the grandkids got up and read grandpa's resume. Not once. It's in the bulletin and it's interesting. It's like background information. But that's not what people are going to talk about at your funeral. What they talk about is they talk about how grandma or grandpa or mom and dad or whoever it is, they talk about their capacity to love. Sometimes love the people who work for them. Like those are the folks who get up and they say, this guy was incredibly busy and incredibly successful. And that's great. But what really made an impact is that he stopped and he knew my name and he cared for me and my family. That's what people are going to talk about. But you already knew that. So let me just remind you that your work is not your greatest legacy. Your greatest legacy will be your capacity to love and to model Jesus and to share and shape people's hearts with the gospel. And I hope that's liberating for you. And maybe even challenging for all of us to reconsider Jesus's words. I mean, these ought to stop all of us short every single day when Jesus says, what does it profit a man or a person to gain the whole world, but lose himself? Last thing I want to say, in just a second, you're going to leave. Yeah. Couldn't come soon enough, right? Time to leave. And a lot of times that's kind of the way it goes, right? Like another Sunday, leave, get back to the real world. But you know, when you leave, something actually profound is happening. Because before you leave, I'm going to pronounce the benediction, which is God's word of blessing upon you. And in my mind, anyway, you're not just leaving, you are being sent. You are being commissioned into whatever work God has called you to do, whether it's working with kids at home, working at the office, or whatever God has called you, whatever God has called you, going back to school, whatever it is. And imagine what it would be like if all 1,200 people here at Herndon, what if, what if we really believed that God is the one who sends us, not to like ordinary work, but to important work he has given us to do? Maybe not forever, but for now. We really believe that he's sending us to be the conduits of his blessing and his healing, to give people a foretaste of the world that is to come, to heal, to instruct, to build, to counsel, all to the glory of God and the good of our neighbor. Just think about the difference this church would make if we began to really grasp it, believe it, and celebrate the fact that your work matters. And I would just tell you, that vision, that vision ought to energize you to do your work well, unto the Lord with great joy. Let me pray for us. Father, we do pray that you would help us to live out these words, this calling you have given us to be your kingdom ambassadors wherever you have called us to go. I pray for my friends here, for the men and women in this room. Work is complicated, and some of us are struggling to find work right now. Some of us are struggling to know what to do next. Some of us are really unhappy where we are. Lord, especially for my friends finding themselves there, would you give them wisdom and peace that you are caring for them, even in this wilderness season? And then for those of us who are deeply energized by our work, would you give us humility to not make it about us, but to make it about you? And Father, for those of us who are training, who are in school, and just are in this season of discernment and not really knowing what you're calling us to do, Lord, give them patience to know that you have planned for them the good works already that you intend them to do, and help them to trust you step by step, and entrust their lives to you, even this part of their lives, which is often difficult for us to hand over to you. Father, for all of us, we thank you most of all for the finished work of Jesus, and we pray that you would help us understand our primary call is the one that comes from him, to follow, to bear our cross, to deny ourselves, that you, Lord Jesus, might be glorified in our lives. We ask it all in the Jesus name. Amen.
