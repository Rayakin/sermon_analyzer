Good morning, everybody. We are opening up to Matthew chapter 5 today as we continue third week in the series, walking through our church's mission statement. That mission statement you can find on the front of your bulletin. We exist to glorify and enjoy God by making disciples who make a difference through grace-filled worship, community, and mission. A couple weeks ago, we thought about what it means to glorify and enjoy God in all things. And last week, Pastor Terrence commissioned us, or I guess recommissioned us, to make disciples. I hope you're here for that. And then today, we are looking at that next part of that same phrase, disciples who make a difference. Now, I don't know what you think about the rest of this mission statement, whether it resonates with you or not, whether it even makes sense to you or not. But I think this phrase, we can all get on board with because everybody I know wants to make a difference. And maybe I should just add like a positive difference in the world. Everybody wants their lives to matter, to count for something, to get to the end of our lives, no matter how many years we have on this earth, and to look back and say, wow, my life really made a difference. This reality hit home for me a number of years ago. You might remember the monster.com ads from the late 90s. I'm guessing based on your looks, not really, but, you know, deeply formative for you, I'm sure. But back in 1999, monster.com had this really successful ad, and it's a job search website. It had just come out, I think, at the time. And the ad was sort of documentary style, kids looking at the camera and answering the question, what do you want to be when you grow up? And it was one kid after another giving a different answer to that question. And the answers went like this. One kid said, when I grow up, I want to file all day. I want to claw my way up to middle management. I want to be replaced on a whim. I want to be a yes, man, yes, woman, yes, sir, whatever you say, sir, for a raise, sir. When I grow up, I want to be underappreciated. I want to be paid less for doing the same job. I want to be forced into an early retirement. And yeah, what makes that work is the fact that no one grows up thinking that. And yet, the nervous laughter you hear around the room is that some of us find ourselves precisely in that place in life. And others of us, others of us have accomplished far more than we ever dreamed of professionally, or in our family life, or just in our station of life, and what we've been able to make and share with others. Like, we've done everything on the list and more. But what that commercial doesn't tell you, because the world never really gets around to telling you this, is that you can accomplish everything you've ever wanted to accomplish. You can have everything you've ever really wanted to have, and you can still be haunted by the question, has my life really made any difference at all? And what's amazing about this short little section that we have in Matthew chapter 5, taken from Jesus' most famous sermon, the Sermon on the Mount, is that Jesus gives us two images that kind of cut both ways. Like, on one hand, they're really convicting, which we're going to see. On the other hand, they're actually really encouraging because they tell us that these two ordinary substances, salt and light, can make an extraordinary difference in the world, which should be an encouragement to all of us, no matter where we are in life, no matter how young, how old, no matter what our jobs are, no matter what our relational status is, no matter how we feel like our lives are going, or what kind of impact our lives are making. Jesus is giving us the ingredients for a life that makes a difference. This morning, as we look at this, I want us to think about what it would look like for us to conceive of our lives as salt and as light. As we do that, let me pray for us as we open God's word together. Father, our hearts long to make a difference in ways that matter and that last. We pray that this brief time in your word, as we saturate and are saturated in your truth, that you would help us to see what it means to follow you in such a way that our lives would be salt and light. We ask it in Jesus' name. Amen. All right, I think Jesus gives us three ways to think about following him in such a way that our lives make a difference. First of all, holding onto our identity in Christ, and then halting and helping. So, hold, halt, help. These three ideas, these three categories help us not just walk through this passage, but understand what Jesus is getting at and what Jesus is calling us to. The first of those is to hold, to hold onto our identity in Christ. Notice, I know I'm not making, you know, this isn't earth-shattering, but it's probably something you've already noticed. But in verse 13 and in verse 14, Jesus says, you are the salt of the earth. You are the light of the world, not you ought to be, or you should really think about, or it's in your best interest to try to be. No, he says, you are the salt of the earth. You are the light of the world. And just to bring this home a little more, that word you, that's a plural you. So, depending on where you're from, it's translated you guys, or yous, or my Pittsburgh people, yins, you know, or y'all. There's, wow, a lot of Pittsburgh people here. Welcome. Others of you, many of you, y'all, or all y'all. Look, the reason I'm emphasizing that is because as soon as you hear something like Jesus saying to you, you are the salt of the earth, or you are the light of the world, you immediately begin to disqualify yourself for all sorts of different reasons. It's like, well, I'm not old enough, or I'm too old, or I'm not good enough, or I'm not mature enough in my faith, or, like, my job's really not that important, or I'm really not that important. And we assume that Jesus is giving, like, a graduation speech at the Jerusalem law school, you know, with the best and the brightest right there in front of him. You, you're going to change the world. Some of you are going to hear that speech in about two weeks at a graduation ceremony, you know, the kindergarten graduation ceremony. You're going to have the principal get up there and say, you are the light of the world. Jesus is saying this to his disciples, the most ordinary people you've ever met. I hope that's comforting for you. No matter how important you think you are, or at least less important that you think you are, Jesus is saying to all y'all, to all of us, you, you're the salt, you're the light. This is also important because it's very easy for us to forget that this, this flows out of the change that Jesus has made in our lives. So we sometimes forget this too, that when Jesus rescues us by his grace, by the power of the spirit, he changes us. Theologians call this regeneration, coming to life from the dead. And that means that when Jesus rescues us, he renews our minds that we love his truth and he renews our wills so that we want to follow him in line with his truth. He changes us, he makes us different so that we will make a difference. We read part of 2 Corinthians chapter 5 earlier for our assurance of pardon. If we'd kept reading, we would have arrived at these words. If you are in Christ, you are a new creation. The old is gone, the new has come. Jesus makes you into those who are salt and light. That is our identity. And this has always been the identity of God's people. If you go all the way back to Genesis chapter 12, when God calls Abraham out of his own country and sends him into a foreign land and blesses him with that covenant promise, part of that promise is, I will bless you so that you will be a blessing. And not just you, Abraham, but your descendants. I will make you into a great nation, a great people, and through that nation, the nations will be blessed. So as we see that covenant promise unfolding in the Old Testament, three, four hundred years later, God's people, Abraham's sons and daughters, great-grandsons and great-great-great-great-grandchildren are brought out of Egypt, out of slavery, into the desert. They're given the Ten Commandments, the new way to live, the family standard operating procedure. This is how you live in my family. And then they are placed at the crossroads of the ancient world. They're not put in some backwater part where they'll never have any contact with any other people who believe anything different. They're put smack dab in the most contested piece of real estate in the ancient world. And then God says, do your thing. Show the world what human flourishing looks like under the righteous rule of the one true God, so that they may know that I am God. This is the way it's been with God's people from the very beginning. God places us in the world so that, as Jesus says here, in observing our lives, in observing how we love, in observing how we do justice and love mercy and walk humbly, people may give praise. A doxological life in the midst of the nations, it's always been that way. It's always been the core identity of God's people. A number of years ago, I was visiting my in-laws in Marysville, Ohio, which is just outside of Columbus, Ohio. It was a Saturday morning and I was doing a donut run for the kids and for me. And I'm on my way back from the donut shop. I'm driving through the center of town in Marysville, Ohio, and I get to the main intersection in town. And in the corner, I notice a garden, beautiful garden, grasses nicely mowed and edged, beautiful flowers blooming, trees, squirrels hopping around, little bunny rabbits, just sort of this little piece of paradise right there in the middle of Marysville, Ohio. And in the middle of that garden was a sign. The sign said this, Demonstration Garden of the Master Gardeners of Marysville. And I thought, well, that's a bold move, Master Gardeners of Marysville, putting that at the most busy intersection in town. I mean, all it would take would be one master gardener deciding, I'm done with this, getting sideways with the main other master gardeners and deciding, you know, the azaleas are not going to get budded this year, or I'm just going to stop doing the flower bed weeding. We'll see how they like that. And like, what if after a while that garden starts looking a little shabby, overgrown, not cared for? That's not just going to reflect on the one, it's going to reflect on the whole. Now the master gardeners have a reputation problem on their hands because if this is their demonstration garden, like if you want to see how it's done, how things flourish and come to life, come see our garden, right? That starts going downhill. What does that say about the master gardeners? And then it occurred to me as I was reaching back and eating a donut out of the back seat, I was thinking to myself, God has a demonstration garden and he always has. He's always placed his people in the world among the nations to demonstrate what fully alive human flourishing looks like. And the amazing thing is that he's willing to stake his reputation on them. He says, I'm going to, I'm going to have you bear my name in the world and they can draw conclusions based on how you love each other and based on how you love your neighbor and based on how you love me about me. Now if you know the story of the Bible, you know that God's people did not live up to that calling. And that's not just true of the Old Testament people of God, it's true of the people of God today. And yet the plan remains the same, as a friend of mine likes to say, you know, the church is plan A and there is no plan B. So salt and light begins, it flows out of our identity in Christ. He has rescued us, he has regenerated us, and he sends us as his ambassadors. He sets us out as the demonstration garden of what human flourishing ought to look like. That's what you get to do every day of your life, no matter what you do. It's amazing. So what does that exactly look like? Why all this salt and light specifically? Well here I'm borrowing from someone else who's used this language, but I just want to give you two categories to think about what it looks like as those who are in Christ to live out this holy calling. Halt and help. And I want to put those next to each other because both are necessary. Both are necessary as Christians engage culture. I think some of us, just as I go along, you'll be like, oh yeah, halting is kind of my default mode or helping is my default mode. But I think what's really important is that as a church, as a local church and as Christians, we hold these things together. We are salt and light. So to be salt means to halt, specifically to halt evil and decay. Because even though for us the main purpose of salt is to make things taste better, you know, you salt to taste, you put butter and salt on your popcorn to make it taste good. If something doesn't have enough flavor, you just keep putting salt on it. That's what we use salt for. But for most of human history, that was not the main purpose of salt. The main purpose of salt was to preserve, specifically to preserve meat, to keep it from going bad, to keep it from spoiling. It was a halting agent. It stopped decay in its tracks. And Jesus is saying here, one of the ways that Christians make a difference in the world is by halting evil, halting ethical corruption, halting moral decay, halting spiritual rot. And again, if you know anything about the history of the church or present day history of the church, the church has not always done this well. Because often, we don't even do that well with our own lives. We see all of those corrupting agents make their way into our own hearts and our own institutions sadly. And so I would say the place we begin to understand what it means to live this kind of life is with us, with your own life, that you keep a close watch on your own heart, that evil and corruption and decay doesn't make its way into your own heart and take root. And this means that part of what it means to be salt is to be distinct from the world, that people should look at our lives and come to the conclusion that we're different, odd. Strange. That they don't fully understand all of the decisions that we make, why we act a certain way. Why it is when we are privileged with places of power and influence, unlike the world, which sees that as permission to get people to do what you want and to leverage your own interests, that Jesus comes along and says, it's in those places of power and influence that you are most able to give your life away and to serve, that the greatest among you, Jesus says, will be the least. That the world would look at us in those places and see people who are humble, who know people's names and care about who they are and treat them like human beings in an organization that often feels like people are just cogs in a machine. And the world doesn't fully understand why we would do that, although the world looks at the decisions we make about things like sexuality, a world that says it's just permission giving on everything. If you want to do what the world says, you should go do it. You deserve to go do that. And here Jesus comes along and says, actually, no, there are boundaries, God-given boundaries that help us really enjoy those good gifts, which is going to require you at certain times of your life to say no, to deny yourself, to delay gratification. The world just doesn't make sense. Like, why would you do that to yourself, the world says, that doesn't make sense. That's different. Or the way we handle money, the world would say, hey, just make as much as you can because the more you have, the happier you'll be and you'll spend more on yourself. And then Jesus comes along and says, actually, it's more blessed to give than to receive. And the world sees us being generous with what we've been blessed with. It's different. Do people look at your life and conclude that you're different? And it's not just in our individual lives. It's also in our public life, what we say no to, that we would be consistent as Christians in saying no to practices, and since we're in D.C., to laws which assault human dignity for all people, that go after the weak and the vulnerable, that create situations in which people don't flourish in freedom, that we'd be willing to step out and say, that's not right, to take a stand, often at a cost, or to understand our own vocations as a way of bringing a halting agent into society. So for those who are in law enforcement or in other sorts of military or intelligence where we're actively seeing the evil in the world coming up against the innocent and the weak, we would fight and push back and do everything we can to protect those who would otherwise be overcome by evil, or those who are engineers, engineering technology that helps us to do that and keep people safe, or those who are in medicine, seeing our work as pushing up against the effects of the fall, the darkness of disease, so that more people may flourish in health. And there's all kinds of other ways we can think about our work, our vocations, as ways in which God is immersing us into this world full of decay and bringing life. But notice what Jesus says, Jesus says, the temptation is to lose our saltiness. Now just so you know, I've got some kids who teach me the lingo every once in a while. I'm usually about two years behind with the lingo, but they started about a year ago calling me salty. I didn't know why they were calling me salty. And they were saying I was salty when we'd play a card game and I wouldn't be happy with the way it went, or playing horse out in the driveway, and they'd call me salty. What that means is, you know, I'm a sore loser, I guess, is what they mean. It's fine. They're probably right about that. Well, that's not what Jesus means by salty, all right? Think the opposite, actually. What Jesus is describing is a distinctive life, and yet, what does he say in verse 13? If salt loses its saltiness, it's not good for anything. You see, this is the temptation of our hearts. It's not to stand out, it's to blend in. Because, man, it's a hassle to stand out. I mean, I don't know how many junior high, middle school kids want to stand. That's like the last thing you want to do. You just keep your head down and blend in. And sometimes it's not much better when you're an adult. Like, you don't want to stand out. You don't want to stand up. You don't want to be different. You just kind of want to get through. You want to blend in, compromise. It's the path of least resistance, and yet, Jesus is saying, be careful, Christians. You don't become saltless salt, unwilling to stand out, stand up, stand against that which is evil. And then Jesus goes on to say, we also need to be those who help. The image here is the image of light. You are the light of the world. You're a city on a hill. You're a lamp on a stand. And it's worth remembering that darkness is more or less an inconvenience in our day, but we live bathed in artificial light all the time. This wasn't the case in the ancient world. Darkness wasn't just inconvenient. It was dangerous. So he's like, you didn't go outside at night. You kept your doors locked. That's where bad things happened to you. So you avoided the darkness. That's where you got lost. That's where you got attacked and robbed, et cetera, and worse. And so to bring light in the darkness is really to bring help to those in need. It's the image of a lighthouse bringing a ship to shore. It's the image of runway lights when visibility is poor. It's this image of help in the midst of darkness. And Jesus is saying, Christian, you're not only salt, you're also light. You're help to those in need. Maybe we planned this. Maybe we didn't. I frankly don't remember, but God did plan to have that particular testimony on this particular day for you to hear from Anne and from members of our church who are helping Afghan refugees who have been coming here for a couple years now and need help. You know, not like help with strings attached, but friendship and a ride and a meal, and in some cases, literally clothes because they left it all, or furniture because they left all that too, help. And last week, you heard from Bethany House, which helps women and children who are victims of domestic abuse help in the name of Jesus. And I could go on and talk about Romanian Christian Enterprises, and Project Belong, and Cornerstone School, and Stephen Ministry, and all of the programs and ministries we have in this church that are helping guide you into ministries of help. But the reason I want to cut it off there is because I don't want you to think of this idea of light as something you can subcontract out to the church. Yes, it's good that we do that together, but I also want this to be the vision for your own life because Jesus says there's another danger at play, and that danger is that we put our light under a basket, that we throw a tarp over the lighthouse. In other words, that we become Christians who just exist in our holy huddle because that's where it's safe. You know, the big bad worlds out there, all those people who don't like us are out there and don't agree with us are out there, and so we just hang out with ourselves, and we talk among ourselves, and we form our little Christian tribes, and we go around together in our Christian tribes, and everything is safe, we think, and insulated from the world and protected. And Jesus is saying, no, no, no, you go. Don't retreat, go and help and bring the light of Christ to those in need just as Christ came to you in your own darkness. You know, when we think about that, just think about things like having neighbors over for a meal, writing a card to someone on our street who's lonely or going through a hard time, just those simple acts of compassion and kindness. I think many of us register that and go, that's not going to change the world anytime soon. Really? Just last week, Pastor Bill and I were on a retreat with our officer candidates. These are guys you heard a moment ago, we're going to elect officers in June. These are the men who have gone through training, and as a culmination of that, we go on a retreat together, and we just get to know each other better. And really the highlight of that time together isn't so much the training, you know, that's kind of a C plus. What the A plus material is on that retreat is sitting around talking to each other about life. And so we give everybody, you know, between 15 minutes and two hours, depending on the person, just to share their life, and how did you come to Christ, and what has God done in your life? And I'll just tell you, the common element around the circle is that it was ultimately, it really just came down to something ordinary, okay? Some guy in high school who came over to the lunch table and said, hey, you look like you're new here, do you want to hang out this weekend? And the guy turned out to be sort of, you know, salty in the best sense of the word, which is different, and ended up being a Christian, and this person ended up becoming a Christian, or the girl on your floor in college who recognized you were having a hard time, and that the party life, like, wasn't working out for you, and so she said, hey, I go to this thing called RUF, would you want to come sometime? Ordinary stuff. In fact, I've done this before in a smaller group, but I've just had us take, you know, time as a group, and audibly say, I asked the group, tell me the one person in your life who's made the biggest difference in your life, and not your parents, you know, not someone in your family, but just the one person spiritually who just changed your life, and we would go around, and what's wonderful is that no one else had heard about any of these people. It wasn't like Billy Graham, R.C. Sproul, who were great. It was like, you know, Bill, who's Bill? Who's this guy who just showed up and taught my communicants class? He just showed up. Or Susie, you know, Susie's just this person who lived on the street and just welcomed me in, like, ordinary. You don't think that changes things. Just take an inventory of your own life and recognize how being this sort of health changes things, because ultimately, it's not really about making a difference. That's not what Jesus is after. What does he say? He says that they may see your good works and give praise to your Father in heaven. Jesus isn't asking us to do anything here. He hasn't done for us already. Jesus has been salt for us. He came into this world to halt evil at our door, to take our sin on the cross. And as he says in John chapter 8, verse 12, I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness. He will have the light of life. Jesus calls us this morning to hold on to our identity so that we might live as those who halt and as those who help, so that people might give glory to our Father in heaven. We pray and ask him to help us do that. Father, we thank you for your word, for showing us who you are. We pray that our lives might be salt and light. And whatever way you call us to do that, Lord, give us eyes to see where you have called us to serve you, how you have called us to serve you. Give us faith, moment by moment, to come to you with the empty hands of faith and be willing to do what you've called us to do so that by your grace, we might humbly point people to you, our heavenly Father. We ask this all in Jesus' name, amen.
