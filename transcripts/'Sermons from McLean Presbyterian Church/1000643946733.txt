Welcome, whether you are here in this room, whether you are at our Herndon site, and it is officially, as of today, our Herndon site. Whether you are online, we're excited that we get to worship together, that we get to approach God's word together. My name is Bill. I'm one of the pastors here. And can I ask you to pray with me? God, our Father. We come to these words, which are words from long ago, but words that have power today. And we pray you'd meet us with them and through them that we would be changed people. We ask it, we pray it, and we ask and pray it in Jesus name. Amen. So what is your happy place? One of mine, without doubt, is outside, preferably in the mountains, preferably hiking. And if you are going to hike outdoors in the winter, you desperately are going to need one of these. This is a base layer. You may well know that if you're hiking outside in the cold or if you're just outside in the cold, they all tell you, dress in layers. And that's true. But you can put on as many layers as you want. And if you don't do the base layer right, the foundation layer, the part next to your skin, that in fact, all those layers, they may end up not keeping you warmer. They may, in the end, make you colder. You've got to have the right base layer or the rest of it doesn't work. But with a good base layer, everything's the way it should be. How in the world does that relate to our sermon series, A Good and Better Story? Here's how. Our society rightly values many, many things, equality, generosity, kindness, and our world and our society rightly opposes many, many things, racism, sexism, human trafficking and many more. And that's just right and good. Our world should hate racism. It should hate sexism. It should hate human trafficking. It should hate exploitation. All these things, all these instincts in our world are the nice, warm layers that make things good and right. But here's the question, why should it? You see, our world has many great instincts and it also has, we need to quickly say, many not so great instincts. But when our current society, our world is at its best, it deeply values human dignity. But far too often, these values and these layers, they're missing the why, they're missing the base layer. And as a result, instead of leading to a greater good world, they can leave things instead surprisingly turning cold. Our society and world for all of its good intentions can actually degrade into sort of a Nietzschean disaster because it doesn't have the right foundation for all its good instincts about humanity. Do we want Christianity to be attractive to non-Christians? Well, I hope the answer is an immediate and quick yes. It will be when we tell a good and better story, not when we just carpet what's wrong, but when we bring the better story. And one of the great ways we can do that for our world is to show our world the why behind something our society does value, because Christianity has the base layer that makes the rest of these layers work. So here's our thesis this morning. Christianity isn't just more true than our world stories. It's better. Better because it gives a consistent vision and reason for human dignity. That Christianity is not just more true than our world stories. It's better. Better because it gives a consistent vision for human dignity. And we'll talk about that this morning under three things all about human dignity. Number one, why we have it. Number two, when we forget it. And number three, how to recover it. So let's start with the first dignity. Why do we have it? Well, our text this morning tells us why human beings have dignity. Listen to verses 26 and 27 again. Then God said, let us make man in our own image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, over all the creatures that move along the ground. So God created man in his own image. In the image of God, he created him. Male and female, he created them. Now, there are all sorts of implications to these verses, far more than just this, but the one we're going to focus on this morning is dignity. Because human beings are made in God's image, they have, we have an inherent dignity, one that can be marred, one that can be defaced, but never fully lost. And that means every human being has this status. Notice even in an incredibly patriarchal and often chauvinistic society, a society that tended to elevate men over women, the Bible right at the start goes surprisingly out of its way to say that this dignity is male and female. Psalm 8, our call to worship, says the same thing. Speaking to God, the psalmist says, what is man that you're mindful of him? And the answer is in God, not us. It says you made him. You see, our dignity comes in the end from our creator, not from us. It comes from the one in whose image we are made. Not in you and me. That God created us in his own image. Think about it this way. If I'm out in the woods and I'm walking along and there's a little pile of rocks, maybe a stream sort of pushed all of it in, and I kick over the pile of rocks, there's nothing immoral in that. That's fine. But if you walk into the living room and kick over your little brother's Lego creation, there is something wrong in that. Why? They're just little pieces of plastic. The value to them is not in them, it's in the fact that your brother created them, that they were made. Well, all the more if someone makes something in his or her own image and then you destroy or deface that. This is why statues are such a big deal on both sides, because a statue is an image and how you treat the statue actually is how you treat the person. This is the reason that grandparents have little crayon scribbles on a piece of paper up on their fridge. It's not because of what it is, it's because of who made it. You and I have value, the scripture tells us. All humans have value, the scripture tells us, because we're made in the image of God. And this gives us a vision for a world we want to live in. This is a true or better story. This is the base layer that makes all the rest of the goodness and equality and generosity and all the rest makes sense. It's an understanding of humanity made in the image of God, therefore with inherent dignity. This is why it's worth opposing the slave trade. This is why it's worth fighting trafficking. This is why it's worth fighting for public health, for education. It's why it's worth fostering and adoption or pouring yourself into your own biological children. It's why it's worth building businesses and jobs. It's why it's worth caring for those who make no difference to society, whether they're so young or so old, because their dignity is there simply because of who they are made in the image of God. Christianity has a positive vision for our world, one that you and I want. Think of the old Pinocchio story. It's the maker's love that makes him more than a wooden puppet. It was this kind of vision that led Christianity. It spread like wildfire through the Roman Empire. Roman culture was almost inherently exploitative. It was all about showing your power over other people economically, militarily, personally, socially, sexually, and into that world. Christianity stepped with a vision of love and value and dignity. And it spread like mad. Famous emperor, he's called these days Julian the apostate. Famously anti-Christian emperor. He realized this was how Christianity was taking over the Roman Empire and he badly wanted to stop it, hence the name Julian the apostate. And so he wrote this to a pagan priest. This is what he said. He said, when it came to the poor that were neglected and overlooked by the pagan priests. Then I think the impious Galileans, that was his term for the Christians, observed this fact and devoted themselves to philanthropy. They support not only their poor, but ours as well. All men see our people lack aid from us. And so Julian went on a program of reform of the pagan priesthood, the Roman Pantheon, and said, we have got to copy the Christians or we don't have a chance. So later he wrote this. He said, it's their benevolence to strangers, their care for the graves of the dead and the pretended holiness of their lives that has done the most to increase atheism, which was his term for Christianity. And so Julian's created a program of Christian emulation among the pagan priests. He said, start doing the same things. Bring about a revival. Don't go to the places that have the licentious shows. Don't treat people badly. But you know what? It didn't work. Julian's program to revive paganism couldn't hold. Because while he tried to ban all the behavior, going to the theaters, while he tried to cause charity and hospitality, in the end, his attempt to force this on paganism failed. Do you know why? Because it was missing the base layer. He could try to force the behavior, but there was no base layer. There was no fundamental reason why to do that. So it didn't catch on. Last week, Ryan said this, he said, where we think we come from determines everything about how we think of ourselves as human beings. The creation stories of the ancient Near East, the world of the cultures around Israel, were very different. They said that creation and humanity had emerged out of a cosmic fight. Humanity was intentionally created, they believed, but created to be scum, to be slaves, to serve the gods. And one lucky human, the king, had become the image of God. But everybody else, the commoners, were simply servants and slaves to be worked to death if desired. Genesis 1 stands alone in ancient Near Eastern creation stories because God creates with a word, giving humans dignity in the image of God. And when that was seen and embraced, Christianity spread like a wildfire. Well, the creation story that you and I learn today from modern secular humanism isn't really much better. It's just different. It's not a story of intentional creation of men and women by gods, but it's a story that says we are a fundamental accident. Humans in our modern creation story of our world aren't thought of as an intentional creation of the gods to be servants, we're understood to be cosmic accidents. Incredibly complicated and complex cosmic accidents to be sure, but just the product of an incomprehensibly long sequence of atoms sticking together and ever more and more and more and more and more complicated organisms. Well, here's the implication of that. If that's really true, we should have no more moral obligation to any bunch of humans than we do to a pile of rocks because they're both just atoms sticking together. So if you have a pallet of rocks, you can break them into pieces, you can scatter them across the ground, you can use them for decoration, whatever, but if you were to take a human being and do the same thing, that's truly and terribly horrible. And you and I, I hope, innately recoil at the thought of something like that. We should. Here's what that shows, here's what it tells us. It tells us that even if the logic of your creation myth this morning, even if your understanding of where people come from says we shouldn't value human beings, you and I all innately know we do. This is, by the way, why you can see people of other faiths doing so much good in the world. This is why you can see people who are atheistic doing good in the world. This is why mercy and kindness don't end up restricted to religious people. So if you're here and you don't believe in God and you're starting to take offense being like, are you saying I don't do good stuff? Actually, you may do a lot of good stuff. Because you and I all know the image of God is there in people, we can't turn off that realization. The question I'm asking is, why would you bother to do good stuff? Maybe the best way to see this is in a famous existentialist novel, The Plague by Camus. Not surprisingly, it shot back up the bestseller list in 2020. Go figure, right? The hero of the book is a guy named Dr. Ryu. He fights tirelessly against the plague in this town. He cares for those who are suffering. He develops therapies. He does tremendous good, but he doesn't believe in God. He's just a practical man, a doctor doing what has to be done. So he cleans abscesses. He injects serums. He pulls people from their homes to the hospital to try to stop the spread. But there's little more he can do. And he even has to distance himself from any pity. And he turns out in this book in the end to be a tragic, if good, character, because at the end of it all, when the plague is passed and the gates of the town are finally opening again, he stands and looks at the celebration. But he knows death's still going to win. Here's the last paragraph that Camus writes of the book. He says, and indeed, as he listened to the cries of joy rising from the town, Ryu remembered that such joy is always imperiled. He knew what these jubilant crowds did not know, but could have learned from the books. The plague never dies or disappears for good. That it can lie dormant for years and years in furniture and linen chests, that it bides its time in bedrooms and cellars and trunks and bookshelves. And perhaps the day would come when for the bane and enlightening of men, it roused up its rats again and sent them forth to die in the happy city. Yet Dr. Ryu gave all the effort, he's the hero of the book, and yet at the end, Camus ends with a complete lack of hope, because in the end, Camus thinks it's still gotten you nowhere. Dr. Ryu and the plague gives the effort because he knew human beings were worth caring for. But why? And this is what a theologian, Cornelius Van Til, writing a generation back at Westminster Seminary, called Borrowed Capital. He said, it's a little piece of the Christian worldview that the rest of our world has borrowed from Christianity to make its life make sense, maybe more even emotionally make sense than intellectually. Because logically, if all you and I are is the product of matter, motion, time and chance times billions of years, then there's actually no more innate value to a human being than a pile of rocks. But you know, there is. The Bible says you are worth more than a clump of dirt. And the difference is the Bible gives you a why for that belief. It has a base layer, the one that makes all the other layers work. So let me ask you again the same question Ryan asked us last week, what's your functional origin story? Do you believe people are created in the image of God? If you don't, why are you bothering to care about them? But the thing is, you do and you should. You see, we want a vision of our world that gives people meaning and dignity, and Christianity gives us one, a consistent one. But here's the thing, and it's our second point. And don't worry, they get faster as we go. We often forget it. What happens when we forget this vision? Let's start real quick and talk about how the world forgets it. But to be honest, I'm far more concerned about how Christians forget it. What happens when the world forgets human dignity? Well, here I should add, don't be blinded by merely Western eyes. When Western culture, for all its flaws, comes in and cares about people, it sits at the end of a long, often very Christian road. One of the primary drivers over thousands of years, 2,000 years to increase the dignity of women in Western culture was the Gospel of Luke. Part of the drive to oppose the slave trade in the British Empire was the deep Christian faith of the Clapham sect. Much of the echo that makes human dignity valued in the world that you live in here, in Virginia or D.C. or Maryland, even if much of a world has forgotten it, owes a remarkable historical debt to a Christian influence. And we should remember there are many faiths out there that don't value human dignity. This is how you get people who are willing to hide behind hospitals or under daycare centers and shoot. This is how you get the meat grinders sending prisoners to certain death, because their faith that in the end don't think humans are worth anything. At the time of this text in the Bible, Pharaoh had a faith and his faith said it was just fine to enslave the Israelites because in Egyptian religion, people were not something to be valued. They were a problem to be managed. Pharaoh was understood to be the image of the gods. His nobles had a place, but the rest of the world, whether they were Egyptian or Hebrew people, were just to work, serve and die. And there's a dark turn when our world starts to accept this. You see, for decades, for centuries even, we have been drumming into ourselves and our children in an origin story that says you're just a clump of dirt, you're a cosmic accident. You're a really complicated clump of dirt, to be sure, but in the end, you're not created, you're just the product of chance. But we drum that message in and then somehow we expect people to live as if both they and others are valuable. We've tried to borrow that capital and simultaneously teach people they're just materialist, but then ask them to act like people have inherent dignity. And a society can live like that for a long time, Dr. Ryu does in Camus, but eventually more and more angry young men have started calling our bluff. Our society has tried to have human dignity without the base layer of the why, but that inconsistency shows through more and more in the lack of civility and the incredible ill treatment of others in the violence that breaks through with more and more alarming frequency, we tell people they're one thing, but ask them to act like another. And more and more people reject that inconsistency with just frightening implications. Christianity gives us a true and better story. It gives the base layer, it gives the why to human dignity. But here's my big concern. Here's my big concern. It's not that the world doesn't believe that. It's that we don't believe this. I'm concerned that we as Christians don't seem to have any base layer either, at least not behaviorally. How do we deal with it when Christians seem to live the opposite of our faith, treating people just as badly, maybe worse than non-Christians do, because you and I both know it happens? My big concern is not that they out there don't act about human dignity. My big concern is that we in here, seemingly we don't. Go figure non-Christians don't find Christianity attractive. A Christianity that says what I've said and then doesn't live it, well, we may have the base layer, but it's like we won't put it on. And that leaves our world unimpressed. You see, God makes demands on us, you and me in this, in the fruit of the spirit, in our interpersonal reactions, in our activities, in our world. This has to be how we treat every human being, the ones we love and the ones we're tempted to hate. This has to impact us corporately and individually. We can have a lot of charity about the different ways to live this out, different understandings of how you achieve this, both personally and even politically. I have no desire to advocate a political partisan position in this sermon. Nor do I have any desire, by the way, to talk you out of being political. Politics isn't bad. In fact, I would tell you politics is necessary in any group of people of any size. The question is just how we do it. But here's what I do have a desire to emphasize. All the elements of dignity are incumbent upon us. It's not optional for us to be generous. It's not optional for us to care for the least of these. It's not optional for us to care about justice. And it's not optional for us to have the fruit of the spirit, for us to treat anyone and maybe especially those with whom we disagree with incredible kindness and generosity and patience. Because that person now, not later, is already still in the image of God. Means there's no room for hatred or scorn. And I got to tell you guys, that last one, scorn, to be honest, seems to characterize how almost we all deal with the people we, and I mean me too, deal with the people we disagree with politically. So our society's current move to dehumanizing the other side, something I would say I see the left and the right both do, that's simply not allowable to us as Christians. The Bible simply doesn't allow us to deny the dignity of the other in how we treat them and how we think about them, even the people with whom we have massive conflict. So before we go on, how is this working in you? Who are the people you are tempted to treat as if they are not in the image of God? Is it a group of people? Maybe another race, maybe another sex, maybe another political party, maybe another social class. Or is it individuals? That person who hurt me, that person who can be so cruel him or herself, or that person who didn't bother to treat me like I had dignity. You know, those made in the image of God included both the Hebrews and their Egyptian enslavers. See, here's my concern. Our world forgets human dignity. It doesn't have a base layer for many of the things it values. We seem to forget human dignity because even though we have the base layer, we often refuse to wear it. And so that means at some level we are all wanting, Christians and non-Christians, neither of us is wearing the right layer, even if for different reasons. And that leads us to the last question about dignity this morning. How do we get it back? How do we recover dignity? We need to see that we recover a sense of dignity when we see Jesus. Two things. First, how he treated people, and second, what he did for us. Let's start with the first. The amazing thing about Jesus when you read the Gospels is the tremendous dignity he gives to others, especially those that tended to be societally scorned. In John 4, Jesus sits down by a well to talk to a Samaritan woman. And if you're to look there in the Bible, even she is stunned about this because Samaritans and Jews hated each other. There was this unbelievable racial divide and Jesus crossed it. In Matthew 8, he reaches out and touches a leper to heal him. And in a society that said of lepers unclean and walked carefully away, lest there be even a risk, not just of disease, but even ceremonial pollution, Jesus reached across that health divide and touched a man to heal him. In Luke 7, Jesus was condemned by his society because he did not shun a woman who was a sinner. That probably in their world meant she was a prostitute. An unbelievably large social divide, and Jesus crossed it. Matthew 14 and Luke 6, he feeds the poor. He regularly emphasizes caring for the least of these. Jesus Christ, our Lord in his life on Earth, treated everyone with dignity, including and even especially those you might not have expected. He thought they were worth something. And he thinks you are worth something. Here's how much. If you think something's valuable, you'll pay a lot for it, right? If you think Tesla is a valuable company, you will pay a lot for his stock. And if something suddenly makes it appear a lot less valuable, like last week's earnings call, you'll suddenly pay a lot less for its stock. Things of great value command a great price. OK, fine. But you know what? I don't care how much you think Tesla is worth. You wouldn't die in order to own Tesla stock. You wouldn't give up your life. But in the case of you and me, Jesus said you were worth everything. Jesus Christ, the son of God incarnate, gave his life for you and for me. He willingly hung on a cross and paid an incomprehensibly agonizing price to redeem us, to pay for our sin. That's how much he gave you and me and all people dignity. He was willing to die for us. And that means he gives us grace when we failed. Look, every one of us, Christian and non-Christian, eventually fails to give people the dignity that they need, that they deserve as God's image. Non-Christian, sorry to be a little offensive. You failed at this. I guarantee it. And you need Jesus. Christian, you and I, sorry to be offensive. We have failed at this and we need Jesus. And he died to pay the penalty for our failures. But the great news of the gospel isn't just that he died for us. The news of the gospel is that Jesus rose and his resurrection means that he has power, power to change our world, but also power to change us. If death even could not keep hold over Jesus, the rules of the world have changed and he claims the victory. And that means not that just he saves us, but he changes us. So here's what the Bible says happens when you and I receive that message, when we realize who Jesus is. The Bible says he starts to change us, that when we receive him as Lord and Savior, he starts doing stuff not just through us, but also in us. And so three verses that when you tie them together, put this remarkable truth before us. Colossians 115 says Jesus is the perfect image of God. He is the invisible, the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. OK, that's great. But then here's what's marvelous. Second Corinthians 318 says when we receive him as Lord and Savior. We start becoming his image. And we all with unveiled face beholding the glory of the Lord are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. In other words, when we become Christians, God starts making us more like Christ, making us more and more, even though slowly and with fits and starts into the image we were always supposed to be. And then that lets us leave sin to image God to the world more clearly. Colossians 3 says this verses 8 to 11. But now you must put them all away. Anger, wrath, malice, slander and obscene talk from your mouth. Do not lie to each other, seeing that you've put off the old self with its practices and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator. So how do I know if I'm treating others in God's image? Well, that list from Colossians, there isn't a bad start. Am I angry, wrathful, malicious, slanderous, full of obscene talk? That's a start. Or do I find myself degrading someone else in my mind so that I have an excuse not to treat him or her with dignity? Or do I excuse my own behavior because of what they've done to me? After all, many times we sin the most when we've been sinned against. Or do I care more about defeating that person than loving them? Last question. When have you, when have I not treated another with dignity? Think of a time, a specific person, a very particular face. Now, why didn't you treat him or her with dignity? Let me suggest why. Because at that moment, I forgot who they were and I forgot who I am. So next time when you see red, when you want to take a peek, when envy comes calling, when you find yourself starting to excuse scorn or hatred or a host of other things our scripture calls evil, try this instead. Remember who they are and remember who you are. And then remember who Jesus is. Remember what Jesus himself tells us, he says, what you've done to the least of these you've done unto me. Amen, let's pray. God, our father. We come. And we simply ask that you would work in our hearts. We know that the word is living and active, and so we trust that you will take it and show us how to make it become more and more true of ourselves. Bring us just a little bit more even today into Jesus's image, we pray and ask in his name, amen.
