Good morning. My name is Terrence Little and I serve here at McLean as pastor for ministries. So for all these various ministries you see around here, I work with all of them. I invite you to pray with me. Our father and our God, by your spirit, give us light to see and to hear your precious word, to hear your instruction. By your spirit, transform us that we will love you more and more and live for you more and more. We ask this in Jesus name. Amen. Around the last year of college for me, when I was trying to figure out where to go to seminary, one of the pastors at the church I attended in college in Greensboro, North Carolina, he invited me to a class at RTS, aka Reformed Theological Seminary in Charlotte, North Carolina. And I went down, the class was on worship. The class was packed, packed. And the professor was a man named John Frame. And John made a statement in that class that I remember to this very day. He was standing in the front of the class and he had a big wingspan like Michael Jordan, long arms. But anyway, he held his arms out, stretched his arms out and he said, all of history is headed toward a great big party. I had never thought about it that way. But think about it. Think about it for a moment. The Bible teaches from the first book of the Bible to the last book, times of newness, beauty, peace, significant pain and suffering, the rise and fall of civilizations, empires, and kingdoms through generation after generation of human injustice, all leading up to a moment when the wrongs of history will be made right. That will be a day of celebration, of great joy, of almost inexpressible relief. Praise the Lord. Today we arrive at the last psalm in the song book of God's people, Psalm 150. This psalm is the great crescendo of the book from Psalm 1, which Pastor Bill began in our series, to Psalm 121, which Pastor Ryan covered last week, through all the other psalms that we did and did not cover, they all lead to Psalm 150. It is the culmination of the Bible's message, and it is what life is all about. Worship. Worshiping God. We have three points to cover this morning, three lessons, if you will. You were made to praise. God is praiseworthy. And third, praise the Lord. First lesson, you were made to praise. You were made to praise. Every human being was made to praise. Praise is second nature to us. You don't have to be taught to praise, do you? Think about it. When a family member or a close friend makes a major accomplishment, graduating high school or college, how do you respond? At music concerts where the stadiums are packed with thousands and thousands of people excited to be there, what are they doing? When a major orchestra finishes a flawless symphony, how do you respond? For UNC Tar Heel basketball fans, yes, yes, yes. When our heels win the national championship, how do we naturally respond? We smile. We shout. We jump. We raise our hands. We cheer. You heap praise on them. You compliment them with accolade after accolade after accolade. Praise comes naturally. Praise involves celebration. Celebration is in our DNA, you all. I grew up in the African-American Baptist church, and celebration was always a great part of our worship services, even the funerals. And just like Psalm 150 commands, we used lots of instruments, all right? My Aunt Gail, who is with the Lord now, she could play the tambourine like nobody's business. My Uncle Randy was and is at home playing the drums. My Uncle Bradley loved to play his modern-day lute, the bass guitar. My mama and my grandmothers joyfully sang to the Lord. My father in his lifetime preached his heart out in praise to the Lord. What do you praise? What do you adore? What do you love? What do you worship? Psalm 150, just like Psalms 146 through 149, begins and ends with praise. Can you guess the Hebrew word for praise the Lord? What is it? Hallelujah! Let's say that together. Hallelujah! That one word is a statement and a command. Hallelujah! Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Psalm 150 commands that the Lord be praised. Lord, capital L, capital O, capital R, capital D, is the intimate name of God. Lord is the covenant name of the Lord. The Bible teaches that the Lord created, designed, and purposed, I couldn't find a better word there, purposed humanity and the universe. God made people for God. God made you and me and all the people around this earth to be in relationship with him, to know him. Saint Augustine, living toward the end of the 300s and up until 430 AD, he said, he wrote, you have made us for yourself and our hearts are restless till they find their rest in you. Praise and worship is directed upward to God. There is a praise that only goes to God. Realizing that we were made to praise the Lord, then we also recognize number two, God is praise worthy. God is praise worthy. Let us consider God's attributes and praise the Lord. The preacher A.W. Tozer, he wrote this, what comes into our minds when we think about God is the most important thing about us. The history of mankind will probably show that no people has ever risen above its religion and man's spiritual history will positively demonstrate that no religion has ever been greater than its idea of God. Worship is pure or base as the worshiper entertains high or low thoughts of God. No doubt there may be some here who do not believe, point two, that God is worthy to be praised. I ask you to consider that you do indeed praise something. You do, in fact, adore certain things in an ultimate way. There are things for you that arrest your affections, that claim your loves above other things or people in an ultimate sense. Where did that impulse come from? Why do you have it? I can assure you nothing in this world or this universe apart from the Lord is able to satisfy or ultimately consummate our impulse and desire to worship and praise that is reserved for God that is reserved for God alone. The Lord is praiseworthy. The Lord God is all-powerful. He is a keeper. As Pastor Ryan preached last week, he is an almighty guardian. The Lord is all-knowing. According to Psalm 139, the Lord knew each and every one of us before we were ever born. Verse 16 of Psalm 139, your eyes saw my unformed substance. In your book were written every one of them, the days that were formed for me when as yet there was none of them. The Lord is always present. Psalm 139 verse 7 says, where shall I go from your spirit? Where shall I flee from your presence? The Lord is righteous, holy, wise, good, merciful, loving, gracious, perfect, and patient. Psalm 28 verse 6, blessed be the Lord for he has heard the voice of my pleas for mercy. The Lord is my strength and my shield. In him my heart trusts and I am helped. My heart exalts and with my song I give thanks to him. The Lord is the strength of his people. He is the saving refuge of his anointed. Oh, save your people and bless your heritage. Be their shepherd and carry them forever. Let us say together, praise the Lord. Let's say it, praise the Lord. Let us consider God's excellent deeds and works and praise God. Any of you are saying, Terrence, where are you getting this from? I'm getting it from verse 1 and verse 2 of Psalm 150. Throughout the Psalms, the people of God are told to remember, remember the mighty works of our God. Rehearse how he has rescued you, provided for you, saved you time and time again. Remember and give praise to God. Listen to some examples from the Psalms. Psalm 78 verse 13, the Lord divided the sea and let them pass through it and made the waters like a heap. Verse 14, in the daytime, the Lord led them with a cloud and all the night with a fiery light. Verse 15, the Lord split rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink abundantly as from the deep. Verse 16, I mean, you have to keep going. He made streams come out of the rock and caused waters to flow down like rivers. Hey, we're in a desert. How are we going to get help way out here? In my own life, when I was in junior high school, my father got deathly ill after a surgery. He was in the hospital for a total of two months. Now, he was a tall and big man, bigger than me, but he became almost as small as me when I was a teenager. Because he was in the hospital, he wasn't working much, and therefore, not much money was coming into the house. We lived in a mobile home, in a mobile home park, literally surrounded by a cow pasture. Money is running low, therefore, food is running low. I remember my mother standing in the kitchen and just weeping, crying out to the Lord to help us, help us. I remember just as clear as a day, the next day, this man came to our house. I still don't know where he came from, and he brought boxes and boxes and boxes of food into our house. He brought so much food, you all, that our cabinets could not fill, could not fit all that food. And my mother praised the Lord in that little mobile home kitchen, and she quoted a verse from Malachi chapter three, verse 10. And I'm going to give you the whole verse. I have to bring all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be food in my house. And this is the Lord speaking through the prophet Malachi to his people. And try me now in this, says the Lord of hosts, if I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you such blessing that there will not be room enough to receive it, let us say together, praise the Lord. Psalm 150 commands that we praise the Lord. It leads to the third and final point today, y'all. Praise the Lord. All of humanity is expected to praise the Lord, but our worship is broken. Humanity's worship is broken. Psalm 150 commands that God, the God of the Bible, the God who made the universe be praised, honored, adored, cherished, loved, worshiped above all things. Psalm 150 says God is to be praised everywhere and by everyone in the sanctuary, in his mighty heavens. But there's a problem. There's a problem. Other things keep getting in the way. Consider these verses from scripture. Claiming to be wise, they, humanity, became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man, i.e. people, and birds, and animals, and creeping things. The first two commandments of the 10 commandments deal with idolatry. Listen. You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself a carved image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them or serve them. For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments. Hear the Lord Jesus say this in John chapter 3, and this is the judgment. Other versions say, and this is the condemnation. The light has come into the world and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. Why? Why? The Bible teaches in history and human experience vividly demonstrates that the eyes of your heart and my heart are magnetized to creation, to jobs, to stuff, to each other, to status, to our wants, to our cravings instead of to our creator. We are born into this world with hearts in rebellion to our creator and his instruction for life. As a result, our worship is broken. Our worship is broken because we are sinners. We miss the mark of God's standard. We are idolaters. We worship everything else except the Lord. And the Bible teaches that because our worship is broken, we deserve condemnation. People don't like hearing that. Romans 1 verse 25, they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the creator who is blessed forever. Amen. This means that our love for and treasuring whatever it is that gets in the way of you and me cherishing God, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, whatever it is that gets in the way, it causes us to get in the way. It means we deserve everlasting punishment because we refuse to delight our souls in the life giver. I'm going to give you another scripture, and this is a tough one. It comes from Revelation chapter 21 verse 8. But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, now you must understand this is God speaking. As for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death. But church, there is good news. Hallelujah. There is good news for us today. Worship requires everything of us, and yet God promises us so much. All of humanity, made to praise, and we know that our praise is broken, and yet God has good news for us and the nations today. Consider with me, if you will, the test of a man named Abraham. In the first book of the Bible, Genesis, God made some incredible promises to an old man named Abraham. God told Abraham, I will make of you a great nation. Now, Abraham was a nobody. That's what you need to understand. He was a nobody. I'll make of you a great nation, and I'll bless you and make your name great so that you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, Abraham, and him who dishonors you, I will curse. And in you, Abraham, all the families of the earth shall be blessed. Remember that last promise. Remember that last promise. In you, all the families of the earth shall be blessed. God promises this old man and his elderly wife a son in their old age. His son's born. His name is Isaac, and when Isaac is a boy, God tests Abraham. Listen to what God says to him. Abraham, take your son, your only son, Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah and offer him there and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I'll tell you. Isaac was the treasure. Isaac was the precious promised son of Abraham and Sarah, and the Lord God told Abraham to sacrifice, to take the life of his only son. Can you imagine the agony of this old man trying to obey his creator? God has spoken and I've got to obey, but oh, this breaks my heart, Lord. We know that God is testing Abraham because we read it, but Abraham didn't know that at the time, and he seeks to obey his creator. The sacrifice of Isaac was to be an act of worship, an act of love and adoration of the Lord, and as they move closer to the place of sacrifice, Isaac asks his father, where is the lamb for a burnt offering? Listen to what Abraham says. God will provide for himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son. As Abraham raises the knife to take the life of his son, the angel of the Lord stops him and provides a ram for the offering. Why am I telling you this? Why am I telling you this? Through Abraham, God's promise of good news to bless the families of the earth is accomplished, and we along with Abraham can praise the Lord. What are you talking about, Terrence? What you talking about? Through the descendants of Abraham comes the only son of God who became a man and is the lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world, i.e. the sin of you and me, so that lawbreakers like us and others can praise the Lord. The Bible says, but God chose his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. John chapter 3 verse 16 says, for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life. God gives us what we desperately need, you all, to be able to praise and worship him. He gives us Jesus. Jesus. Jesus enables us to worship God rightly. He enables us to have a heart and mind to praise God. We need Jesus. The nations need Jesus. We need to embrace and cherish what the Bible teaches about Jesus. Jesus is the focal point of all of redemptive history of the Bible and you all of all of time in history. He is the focal point of the Psalms, the Bible, and history. All of history is headed towards a great big party. You and I, the people driving up and down 495 right now, your family members, your friends, your co-workers, your neighbors, your children, the leaders of our cities, of our counties, of our states, our country, the people in Asia, in South America, in Central America, in Africa, Australia, and Europe will not be able to be a part of that party apart from Jesus Christ. Psalm 150 is a glorious psalm and song of consummation and it is a command. I conclude with this. The last book of the Bible, Revelation, describes the great party. God is going to wipe away all tears from his people's eyes. All evil and all those who never and all those who never trust Jesus will receive their due reward, which is God's judgment. For the people of God, there will be great singing, worship, and praise of God because of Jesus. But I want you to hear something else from the last chapter of the book of Revelation because I believe it connects directly to the last statement in Psalm 150. The Spirit and the bride say, come. And let the one who is thirsty come. Let the one who desires take the water of life without price. When you, the church of Jesus Christ, the bride of Jesus Christ, when you praise the Lord, the thirsty see and hear. Don't you want them to see and hear and then them praise the Lord through Christ as well? What are you praising, church? Amen. Amen, brother. Amen. What are we praising? What does the world see us praising? I'm going to close, I promise now I will, with a quote from this book by John Piper, Let the Nations Be Glad. Let the nations be glad. Worship, therefore, is the fuel and goal of missions. It is the goal of missions because in missions, we simply aim to bring the nations into the white-hot enjoyment of God's glory. The goal of missions is the gladness of the peoples in the greatness of God. The Lord reigns. Let the earth rejoice. Let the many coastlands be glad. Psalm 97 verse 1. Let the peoples praise you, O God. Let all the peoples praise you. Let the nations be glad and sing for joy. Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Amen. Would you pray with me? Our Father and our God, we give you praise. We say hallelujah. We long to worship you with pure hearts and minds. We know that we cannot even approach, even now in prayer, you if it were not for your grace, your mercy, your love given to us in the person and work of Jesus Christ. Cause your global church, Father, and us here at McLean to praise you and through us draw others out of unbelief so that they can praise you too. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, we pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.
