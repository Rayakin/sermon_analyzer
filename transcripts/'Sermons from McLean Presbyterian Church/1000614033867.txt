Good morning, everybody. My name is Ryan. It's my privilege to open God's Word with you this morning. We're looking at Acts chapter one. It was just read for us. I'd encourage you to have that in front of you. We forgot to mention earlier as well, just to keep you multitasking, if you could fill out those keeping connected forms that should be on the inside or outside of the aisle, just while you have a second and you're finding your place and your space. If you could fill that out and let us know that you're here, that helps us out tremendously. Thanks so much. We have been working through our church's mission statement. You can find it on the front of your bulletin. We've been doing that so that we can reflect together, not just on what we do as a church family, but why we do it. And so we've been opening up to different passages in scripture to understand what it means to be a church that exists to glorify and enjoy God by making disciples who make a difference through grace-filled worship, community, and mission. The last two weeks we've talked about worship and community and this week we're talking about mission, which may or may not be your favorite of the three. I have no way of knowing that. I suspect worship is not a big stretch for you if you're here or you're watching online, you care about worship, or at least you're connected with somebody who cares about worship who made you come here. So one of those two things is true. And probably no one at work is going to critique you for spending your Sunday morning in worship. They may not understand it, but they're not gonna give you a hard time for it, most likely. Community, what we talked about it last week, even introverts need community every once in a while. They need meaningful relationships. They need to walk together, grow together, especially in a Christian life, we need community. So we got that one covered. But mission, mission we sort of have mixed feelings about. Because mission, especially if you take seriously what Jesus says in this passage, mission is the sort of thing that can be offensive to people that not everyone in your life loves the idea that Jesus has called you into this grace-filled mission to make him known. Not everybody is completely on board with that idea. In fact, that might even make us a little uncomfortable even to know where to start. We appreciate missionaries when they show up and tell us about foreign exotic places and what God's doing there. We tolerate the missions committee and all of their shenanigans and all of their enthusiasm. We're happy for them to do that. We may even write some checks and support people who do different missionary work around the world. But evangelism, being on mission, that doesn't always resonate with our felt experience or even our felt desire for what we envision our lives to be. It's interesting, in this passage, which is in many ways just Jesus reiterating his great commission in different words, the disciples have a question that reveals that they have some mixed feelings about mission as well. It's the question they asked in verse six when they pull Jesus aside and they ask him, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? Now you have to understand, they're asking this question about 39 and a half, 40 days after the resurrection. And so they've spent time with Jesus. He's been teaching them. We learned earlier in verse three about the kingdom of God and they think they finally have it figured out. They think all that's gonna happen right now. Like they're starting to get the mission accomplished banner ready. Like they're hoping Jesus is gonna say, you know, you've arrived at the finish line. It's over. All the work is done. We can just sit back and enjoy. Because of course, what's behind this question is, Lord, are you about to restore the kingdom? Which means we can be with you in the kingdom and talk about worship and community. Woo. They're ready for it. Is the mission over, they're asking. It's kind of like the question some of you are going to get in a few weeks or a few months from the backseat of the car. Are we there yet? All right, if you're a parent, you can handle that question in any number of ways. No. That's one way. But it's coming back. The question's coming back. So you can just say no and be done with it. Or you can do some creative parenting and explain how the journey is part of the adventure. And Jesus here is doing some creative parenting when it comes to our missional reluctance and our kingdom impatience and our desire just to be there. Jesus does some creative parenting. And in answering, he does say no, by the way, but he does it in a creative way that you don't really know he's saying no. What he's really saying is I want you to be part of the adventure of being on mission with me. That's what he's inviting us into this morning. So let me pray for us and we'll consider that together. Father, thank you for inviting us into the mission that you are about. Thank you, Lord, that we ourselves are the mission field. We wouldn't be here otherwise. We thank you, Holy Spirit, that you are present, active, powerful. And we ask, even as you gather us now, that you would equip us for what you have before us this week as you send us back out to be witnesses to the kingdom. We ask it in Jesus' name, amen. All right, so how does Jesus invite us to join the adventure of his grace-filled mission? We have to understand two things that he talks about in this passage. First of all, that the grace-filled mission that we talk about in our mission statement and that we're all about at this church is, first of all, Jesus' work. It's, first of all, Jesus' work. But in response to Jesus' work and in order to join him in that work, he calls us to be witnesses. So when we think about grace-filled mission, we have to start by understanding it's Jesus' work and it's our witness. First of all, let's talk about it being Jesus' work. It's summer, it's sequel season. Some members of my household went out last night and watched the third installment. I think it's the third installment of the Guardians of the Galaxy, move, sorry, thing. And I think it's the third one, right? And then there are other ones coming. There's Mission Impossible 45's coming out later on today, part one later out this summer. Indiana Jones, you can go watch Indiana Jones again. I don't know what you could possibly be up to anymore, but he's still there. But we go back. Hollywood loves sequels because they make money, but the reason they make money is because we go and see sequels. Like, we're willing to go, and in some ways, we're just picking up the story where it left off. We love the characters, we love the story, we wanna know what happens next, and so we go. We put down our hard-earned money and we say, I wanna see that movie. The Book of Acts is a sequel. You have to understand that, okay? It's part two of the Gospel of Luke. Both are written by Luke, the Gospel of Luke, a biography of Jesus, the Book of Acts, the first 30 years of the church, and they go together. They go together. And we know this because Luke starts the Book of Acts with these words. In the first book, O Theophilus, by the way, Theophilus was most likely a curious, interested, inquisitive person about Jesus, and so Luke takes the time to write the whole Gospel of Luke to help him understand who Jesus is, and then he adds on the Book of Acts as part two. But what I really want you to notice is what he says next in the first book, Gospel of Luke, I have dealt with all that Jesus began to do and to teach until the time he was taken up, until his ascension. In other words, the Gospel of Luke is about everything Jesus began to do and teach. By implication, the Book of Acts is everything Jesus continued to do and to teach after he was taken up. Now wait a second, how can Jesus, who is at the right hand of the Father, continue to do anything, let alone be active and alive? Well, Luke goes on to explain in verse three that he spent those 40 days from his resurrection to his ascension presenting himself to his disciples, that they might be convinced that he really was alive and well, that the same Jesus they were with for three years and went to the cross was the same Jesus who came out of the tomb. In other words, the disciples were not men who had a sighting of Jesus in the Galilean hills shrouded with fog like some sort of Palestinian Bigfoot sighting. Like I think we might have seen him one time. That's not who these men were. They were eyewitnesses to the resurrection. Jesus spent 40 days with them. In fact, the Apostle Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians 15, there were 500 other people who saw Jesus during that time. And he writes that at a time when people could have looked those folks up and went and asked, did you really see, touch, eat with, sing with, hang out with Jesus? And they would say, yes, he is alive and well. And not only is he alive and well, he is also ascended into a place of authority. Well, how do we know that? Well, Luke tells us that the disciples were also eyewitnesses to this event. Verse nine, as Jesus was saying these things, like in the middle of the sentence, as they were looking on, Jesus was lifted up and a cloud took him out of their sight. The cloud here was not primarily Jesus's mode of transportation, like he just grabbed a cloud and took off. It's his mode of exaltation. This is a way of saying he's translated into glory because in the Old Testament, whenever the cloud shows up, it was the cloud of glory. The tabernacle was surrounded and filled with the glory of God, it was described as a cloud. Mount Sinai, a cloud descended when the presence of the holy God descended. Even the Mount of Transfiguration, Jesus is shrouded in a cloud. This is a picture of glory, of being moved from a lower place to a higher place. This is the moment in which Jesus ascends in order to be crowned King of Kings, Lord of all, and to sit at the right hand of the Father and to rule. Now, why am I camping out on this? Why am I camping out on the ascension? Is it only because it was ascension day on Thursday, the day when the church around the world celebrates the 40 days after Easter when Jesus ascended? Maybe. It's a good thing to remember that we're part of a worldwide family that recognizes this event in Jesus's life. It's also to say, this is an incredibly important moment as we think about missions. Because it tells us, in addition to the resurrection of Jesus, the ascension of Jesus gives us confidence that Jesus is still at work. That the work didn't stop when he left. That Jesus is still at work. It means that wherever you go, Jesus is already there by the ministry of the Holy Spirit. You can never leave the jurisdiction of the risen, ascended Lord. So, it doesn't matter whether tomorrow you're just going to the office, or the home office, or you're heading off to camp, or maybe you guys are moving away this summer. Maybe you just moved here. Maybe you're going on one of our mission trips to West Virginia, or Scotland, or later this fall to Cuba, or all the other places that we have short-term trips going out. Jesus is already there, and he's already at work. That means, when we talk about grace-filled mission, we're not talking about God giving us a pep talk as the coach, and saying, now, get out there and go get him, make something happen. No, we start with the understanding that Jesus is already there. He's already at work. Everywhere you go, everyone you know lives in the jurisdiction of the risen, ascended King. It means Jesus is at work. So, when we talk about grace-filled mission, when the disciples are given this commission, it doesn't come down to their eloquence, their influence, their education status. Nothing wrong with any of those things. You guys have plenty of all of that. But that's not where we start. We start with the fact that Jesus is at work. And this means, then, that our job is to sit back and watch him. No. Right, at the same time that he says this, he says, and you will be my witnesses. And I'm sending you to go. It's interesting, actually, as we talk about our witness, that Jesus says in verse eight, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria, and to the end of the earth. In other words, here is Jesus, again, affirming that we need the presence of God, the Holy Spirit, in us and through us, in order for us to do any of the tasks that the Lord has given us. And at the same time, Jesus says, and when you go, you are to be my witnesses. There is work for you to do. What does it mean to be a witness? Well, we've watched enough courtroom dramas, I think, to know that witnesses are important. We know that they are people who see something and who say something. I'm even thinking of those, this isn't a witness description, but you've seen those signs in the metro, in the airport, and other places. If you see something, say something. Now, that's talking about reporting suspicious activity, and that's not what the Gospels are talking about. Jesus is talking about seeing Jesus and saying something about Jesus, because this is what you do with good news, okay? Like, good news is meant to be shared. I mean, you can think about having a conversation with a friend of yours, and you walk into the party, and your friend sees you, and you have a big smile on your face, and your friend says, what's going on? I have some great news. Really? Well, tell me what the news is. Well, I can't tell you what that, I can't tell you the good news. Whoa, oh, is it good news? It's very good news. Really? Well, is it like, top secret, classified good news? Like, I can't know? Oh, no, you can know. Oh, well, why don't you tell me? Because I choose not to. That would be odd, right? That would be strange, and yet, when we talk about Jesus, what are we doing? We're sharing good news. If you flip a few pages to Acts chapter eight, verse nine, there's this incredible conversation between Philip, one of the apostles, and a government official from Ethiopia, and by God's providence, they end up meeting, almost running into each other. The Ethiopian happens to have some spiritual questions at the ready. He asks Philip these questions, and in response, Luke tells us that Philip shared the good news of Jesus. That word there is a big, scary word. Are you ready for it? The word there is evangelized. Now, we've made that a big, scary word. You know, it's like the E word, evangelism, but that word just means good newsing somebody. In fact, literally, what Acts eight, nine says is he evangelized him, Jesus. He told him about Jesus, and yes, when we talk about being a witness, we should absolutely include the whole area of being a good character witness. We talked about this a few weeks ago when we said that we want to make disciples who make a difference. We talked about being salt and light in the culture, that our lives are signposts to the kingdom that is here and that is coming. So absolutely, we should have that conversation, but we don't have that conversation because you were mesmerized by the sermon a few weeks ago, and if you weren't, you can go mesmerize yourself and go listen to it. So I don't want to shortchange that, but often what doesn't get mentioned in the conversation is that witnesses see something and say something. And it gets shortchanged because I know that I'm kind of pulling a fast one on you, that it's really not that simple to say that good news is meant to be shared because you know as well as I do, there are people in your life who, if you were to share the good news about Jesus, they would not think it's particularly good. Now, of course, there is some bad news that goes with sharing the good news, and we could talk more about that, but generally speaking, when the Bible talks about talking about Jesus, it's evangelism, it's good newsing somebody. And we know that even if we just mention the name Jesus to some people in our lives, they're going to immediately think that we're being judgmental and pushy, immediately. Or if we share our conviction about Jesus, they're going to think we're deluded and crazy. Like, yeah, if you want to go believe that, you can, but you obviously left your brain somewhere at the door at church, right? Or some people who, when we begin to tell them that the Bible tells us that Jesus is unique, you know, he's not Jesus the great, you know, as in Alexander the Great, he's Jesus the only, he's the only way we can experience forgiveness, the only way we can be made right with God, they're going to immediately say, well, that's intolerant, or that's disrespectful of what I feel. So yeah, we know how some of those conversations are going to go sideways. And yet it seems to me, speaking as not the most bold evangelist in the room, I'm sure there are others of you who are better at this than I am, but it seems to me what we often do is take the worst case scenario, and we just kind of make it the every case scenario. And we just assume that no one wants to talk about Jesus, ever. Which just isn't true, actually. Now granted, in a lot of cases, we have to earn the right to say anything other, you know, that has anything to do with anything other than news, weather, and sports, right? So we do have to earn the right to speak just by relationship and being a good neighbor and all of that. But when we do speak, actually what you find is there are people in our culture right now who would love to have a respectful, thoughtful conversation about something that matters. I know that feels like a low bar. It's not a low bar. And so this is very inconvenient because I've been convicted by my own sermon all week. I just hate when that happens, but it happens from time to time. And here we are. And I think to myself, well, if I'm gonna be a good neighbor, the grace-filled mission Jesus is talking about to be his witnesses, if it starts with Jesus's work, I probably should pray more about, you know, being given the opportunity to share the gospel. Lord, give me an opportunity, again, let's just lower the bar a little bit, to have a spiritual conversation with somebody. And then, Lord, give me the courage and, you know, the intelligence in the moment to give a coherent answer to their questions. Because when you read the book of Acts, when you read Paul's letters, what you find is the apostle Paul often asks, would you pray for me that I would have a window of opportunity to share the gospel? And if Paul felt compelled to pray that, I think we should probably put it on our list. I feel like that's important. Lord, give me one opportunity this week to have a spiritual conversation with somebody. I was talking to a friend of mine, just, I'm gonna throw out some other creative ideas. We're just brainstorming, there are no bad ideas. We're just brainstorming together. A friend of mine this week told me he was on a run the other morning listening to a Tim Keller podcast, actually. And as he was running by his neighbor, he had this idea, what if I started a podcast club with some guys in my neighborhood? You know, a book club with all, you know, without having to do all that reading and such. But, you know, podcasts, people can give you 40 minutes in the car or working out to listen to a podcast, and so he's like, well, what if I just, some guys in my neighborhood who I don't think go to church, I don't think they're Christians, I have a relationship with them, we hang out from time to time, I'll send the podcast out, we'll get together twice a month and we'll talk about it. It's a great idea. Seems to me that that's something that some of us could do. Some of us are in a community group. What if a community group, pick two times a year, rather than just meeting as a community group, invite your neighbors, invite the folks on the block and have people at your home just to care for them and love them and be good neighbors and see what the Lord does. It doesn't have to be complicated, but if you're anything like me, it has to be intentional. I said last week, you know, the drift of our heart is not toward community and vulnerability, it's toward isolation. That's the drift of our hearts. Maybe I'm just, I'm being vulnerable. That's the drift of my heart. It's not toward people, it's a way. It's to kind of protect myself. I would say the same thing about mission. The drift of our heart is not to put ourselves out there in risky mission. The drift is to protect ourselves and to be safe and snugly and comfortable. And here, Jesus is saying Christianity to follow me is not some snug little religion. It is to get out there, get off the sideline, get in the game and to be on mission with Jesus by being his witnesses. Where do we do that? Well, this is the point in the briefing in verse eight where Jesus pulls down the map. Remember those old movies? He pulls out the pointer, he goes, I want you here, here, here, okay? And it's Jerusalem, all Judea, Samaria, and the end of the earth, okay? So you can imagine he's like drawing like, you know, all right, okay, you get it too, right? It's like he's drawing the circles. You're gonna be here and then you're gonna be here and then you're gonna be here. And the disciples are thinking, that looks like everywhere. If my math is correct, sir, that's everything. And yet Jesus marks it out in circles. That's chronologically how it happened because they were all starting in Jerusalem. But I think it's also important for us to recognize that this just reemphasizes the importance of community, of church, because some people have a passion for the right here. Like some people are all about serving at Cornerstone School in DC. Some of our people are on the board there. Some of our people teach there and volunteer there. I mean, it is a Jerusalem ministry, a here ministry, a DMV ministry, and you're all about it. And other people are all about going to Romania and caring for kids there and sharing the love of Jesus and everything in between. And sometimes as a church, we kind of get into like, well, I think Jerusalem's more important than the end of the earth. I think the end of the earth is more important. And yet Jesus is saying, it's all in the scope of my mission, why? Because that's how big God's heart is for the nations. This has been the case from the very beginning. God is a missionary God. When he called Abraham to himself, he said, I'm gonna bless all nations through you. Jesus came to seek and to save the lost. Paul was sent to the Gentiles. The spirit drives the church into the world and the climax of history is a missionary moment. It's Revelation chapter seven, when we get a glimpse of the multitudes in heaven, which is the fruit of the mission, a family God has gathered to himself from every tribe and nation and language. And John tells us there, a multitude too numerous to count. Jesus is at work doing that now. And he invites us to join him. It's amazing. It doesn't need us. But as I said a couple weeks ago, the church in God's wisdom and God's grace is plan A for the mission. And there is no plan B. One person has put it this way. God does not have a mission for the church. God has a church for the mission. Joe mentioned a few moments ago, I think what most of you have already heard, that our former senior pastor, Steve Smallman, died a week ago, actually last Sunday. He was pastor here, as Joe said, from 1967 to 1996. And the church has been in a few different buildings over the years, beginning in Georgetown and eventually working its way out to the small hamlet of McLean, Virginia. And the building that the church used to worship at, in, around, in, was down the street, go down Balls Hill, take a left on Old Dominion. And it's where the Korean church meets now. Our Korean brothers and sisters worship in that church now. And then that's when the church came over here. So this week I was talking to folks on our staff and going through some old photographs. Several of them are in the church history, if you've seen our church history book. And I ran across one that I wanna share with you. So they're gonna put it up on the screen here. So this is a photograph. This is at the old church, okay? And this is the day that the cross went up on the steeple at the old church. And that is Steve Smallman up on the crane. So the official history is that Steve volunteered to do that. I think the real story is one session meeting too many went after midnight and so he was volunteered for that task by the elders. I'm not sure that that's true or not. I also know that that is not in the job description of the senior pastor any longer. I know that for a fact. I put it in the bylaws yesterday as a matter of fact and approved it myself. I love a lot of things about that picture. One thing I love about that picture is it says a lot about Steve and what his ministry was all about. To be a faithful shepherd of God's people for almost 30 years is a gift. It's a gift that keeps on giving by the way. To be a preacher of the gospel week in and week out where he lifted up the cross before this congregation for 30 years is a gift. It's a gift that keeps on giving. And I also love this picture because it says something about our church. So I don't know what year this was taken. I'm guessing the 70s or 80s. But the church has been around longer than that. Church has been around for almost 80 years. Some version of acclaimed Presbyterian church, the capital Pres family. And so this picture tells me that and reminds me that as a church, by God's grace, he has placed us in D.C. to bear witness to Jesus. Now even though that's no longer our steeple, that's no longer our cross, now that the sound wall is down, more people are being able to see our cross, that's not really what I'm getting at. I'm actually not just talking about being able to gather together for worship each and every Sunday. As much of a joy as that is to my heart as I know it is to your heart. Or not just to be in our community groups where so much good stuff is happening, but actually this idea that every week the Lord gathers people from all over the DMV to worship him. To worship the risen, ascended Christ who one day will return to make all things new. And to bring to him our prayers and our needs and our supplications. And then you know what he does? He sends us back out. By the spirit he sends us back out into all different jobs and relationships and all kinds of responsibilities. So that we might lift up the cross we might bear witness to Christ. What a privilege that we get to be part of that, you get to be part of that. And you don't have to be dangled from a crane to do it, that's even better. But the Lord is calling you to be faithful wherever he's called you to go. And he's promised that he goes with you. Let me pray. Father, we thank you once again for the example of Steve and Sandy. We do pray for them, for their comfort. That they would grieve with hope. Hope the gospel. Lord we thank you too for your faithfulness to this church that as imperfect as we are and often faltering as we are, you have faithfully used this congregation in this city. And through this city really use this congregation for the world. That more and more people might see Jesus, might look to the cross and place their faith in him. May we do this work for your glory and may we enjoy you above all things. We ask it in Jesus name, amen.
