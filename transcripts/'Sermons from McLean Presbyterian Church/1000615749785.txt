Well, good morning, everybody, and welcome. It's good to see you as we open up together to Psalm 116, the psalm we just sang together. It's a psalm we're going to be taking a closer look at this morning. Our summer series, our summer preaching series this summer for the next few months is to take a closer look at various psalms. Last week we started out by looking at Psalm 1, Psalm 116 is before us this week. As I was studying this psalm this week, I also ran across a story, maybe you saw it as well, that this past week there was a dramatic rescue off of Mount Everest. Now it's probably not uncommon that climbers get rescued off of Mount Everest, it kind of happens all the time because of how dangerous that place is, but this rescue was rare in that it took place in an area of the mountain known as the death zone. If you read about Mount Everest at all, you know this is the place where many climbers run into danger, and in fact where many climbers die because the air is so thin at this one particular point and the temperature drops so significantly and so many climbers get stranded in that area and can't get out and helicopters can't get in. Well in this particular case, this climber was stranded in that death zone and thankfully for him there was a guide who heard about it and was willing to descend about a mile down into that area to find him and to carry him out. In fact when you go and look at the pictures or the video of this rescue, which you can find, literally this climber, this guide goes down into that area, takes a bedroll, wraps him up, straps him to his back, and backpacks him out for five miles down the mountain. Six hours. It's an amazing story and it's one you don't hear very often, but it's also one that you can find in other places. Some of you have probably watched the documentary on the rescue from the flooded cave, those boys and their coach rescued in Thailand a number of years ago, incredible, incredible what those rescuers did, how they risked their lives to save those kids. And those stories may interest us, they may entertain us, they may inspire us, but what Psalm 116 wants to do for us, and you maybe even picked up on it a little bit when we were singing it, is Psalm 116 wants to pose a question. And the question is, what if that was your story? What if you and I are part of a great rescue story? What if you sit here today as someone who has been rescued just as dramatically, like how would that change the way you live today? How would you respond to the person who rescued you, who risked his life to rescue you? Psalm 116 says, even as it poses that question, that this is our story. And that as those who have been rescued, we need to learn to respond in a way that gives honor to this incredible rescue. Psalm 116 is before us, I hope you have your Bible open or some version of it on your phone or otherwise. I'm going to read it for us. Psalm 116, I love the Lord because he heard my voice and my pleas for mercy, because he inclined his ear to me, therefore I will call on him as long as I live. The snares of death encompassed me, the pangs of Sheol laid hold of me, I suffered distress and anguish. Then I called on the name of the Lord, O Lord, I pray, deliver my soul. Gracious is the Lord and righteous, our God is merciful, the Lord preserves the simple. When I was brought low, he saved me, return, O my soul, to your rest, for the Lord has dealt bountifully with you. For you have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling. I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living. I believed, even when I spoke, I am greatly afflicted, I said in my alarm, all mankind are liars. What shall I render to the Lord for all his benefits to me? I will lift up the cup of salvation and call on the name of the Lord. I will pay my vows to the Lord in the presence of all his people. Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints. O Lord, I am your servant, I am your servant, the son of your made servant, you have loosed my bonds, I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving and call on the name of the Lord. I will pay my vows to the Lord in the presence of all his people, in the courts of the house of the Lord, in your midst, O Jerusalem. Praise the Lord. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God, our God and our Father, I pray that the words of my mouth and the meditation of all of our hearts would be pleasing unto you, our God, our rock and our redeemer. In Jesus' name, amen. If you have a hard time relating to a climber plucked off of Mount Everest and backpacked out for five miles, I understand. Most of us have not experienced that. If you happen to be someone who was rescued off of Mount Everest, wow, and I'd love to grab a cup of coffee with you after and hear more about that. Either way, Psalm 116 is given to us like every other psalm as a song that is meant to be sung by God's people. The psalms are not a discovery of King David's private journal. The psalms are the official hymn book of the church. They are given to us that we might sing them together and mean it. And what that means for us is that even if you can't relate to every single line or word in this psalm, it is given to us as a way of framing our lives, understanding our lives and ourselves, as a way of orienting our hearts toward the one who has rescued us. Psalm 116 is a deliverance song. It's a rescue song. It's the kind of song you sing when you have been dramatically rescued and it is given to us this morning that we might sing it and mean it. So how do we do that? I want to give us two thoughts this morning, the ways in which this psalmist guides us through this song. First of all, we have to remember our deliverance. And then secondly, we have to consider our response. We have to remember our deliverance and then consider our response. We don't know exactly what the psalmist was going through. There are other psalms like Psalm 18 that come with liner notes, so they give us background. They're very specific. They say this psalm was written at this time in this place, so we have the historical context. We don't have that here. What we do have, however, are vivid details. You can't read this psalm and not feel what's happening here. We're given, for example, in verse 3, these vivid recollections of what this person was going through. The snares of death encompassed me, a snare, a trap. Other translations say the cords were meant to feel this trap gripping us and pulling us back. This isn't like walking through a spider web. You walk through a spider web and you feel the invisible strands. You try to wipe them off you because it's inconvenient and maybe a little yucky and scary for some of us who are scared of spiders, but that's not what's being described here. What's being described here is feeling the cords, the snare around your body, and it's the snares of death. It goes on to say in verse 3, the pangs of Sheol, that's the realm of the dead, lay hold of me. It's a sense in which what's being described here is a life and death struggle. It's that feeling of being pulled toward death, maybe physical death, maybe spiritual death, maybe emotional death. And by describing his situation this way without defining it, the psalmist is actually doing us a huge favor because he's inviting us into his story so that we might make it our story because all of us have experienced something like this before. Some of us have experienced the distress of a cancer diagnosis or the pain of cancer treatment. Some of us know the exhaustion of chronic pain, the frustration of chronic pain. Some of us know the heartbreak of infertility. Some of us know the struggle of mental illness. It feels like a snare, like a trap that pulls us. The harder we fight, the tighter it clutches at us. Some of us know the snare, the real trap of addiction, of eating disorders, of besetting and persistent sin that no matter how much willpower we apply to it, we just continue to fall into it. It almost feels like an invisible force that has its hold on us. We know what this feels like. Some of us have had close calls with death. We got into a car accident when we were 16 years old that looking back we never should have walked away from. Some of us because of our jobs have been in death-defying situations, firefights and other physical dangers that looking back and even in the moment we say there's no reason I should have walked away from that. Others of us have been stranded without water, have been left behind, have experienced the anguish and distress that's being described here. The question the psalmist wants us to ask is when you review that, when you look back from where you sit this morning and you look at that situation and you look at how you were brought out of that situation, the question is how do you explain it? How do you make sense of it? What happened back then? Was it just chance? Were you just fortunate that things just kind of work out? What's the explanation for you going from a place where you were almost gone to a place in which you were walking again in the land of the living? How does that happen? The psalmist wants us to remember our deliverance and enter into this story and begin to ask ourselves how it is that we're still here, why we're still here, and also guide our understanding because you see the explanation he gives is when I was in that situation, verse 3, verse 4, I called on the name of the Lord, O Lord, deliver me. Now, some of you know what a foxhole prayer is, a prayer of last resort. When you're desperate, when you're at the end of your rope, you're out of answers, you just shoot up a prayer and hope that God answers. This may sound like a template for a foxhole prayer. Maybe it is, but it doesn't stay that way for this psalmist. As he looks back, he finds this prayer of desperation to be a foundational prayer for the rest of his life. He learns things from this experience of deliverance. First of all, that the Lord is attentive. I mean, this is what amazes him the most from the very first verse, that the God of the universe actually listened to him. Notice how he says it in verse 1, three times basically says the same thing. I love the Lord because he has heard my voice and my pleas for mercy. He inclined his ear to me. If you're a parent, you know how this works. Your ears are finely tuned to the frequency of your child's voice. It's amazing. It defies logic and maybe even physics, but it's true. You can be in Chuck E. Cheese with a thousand other kids and families. You can be on a playground with people all over the place and kids screaming all over the place. You can be dead asleep where nothing else would wake you up, but as soon as you hear your child cry, you incline your ear. You just know it. You can pick it out of a crowd. And what the psalmist can't get over is that this is the way God looks at him. Of all the voices, God heard his voice. God hears your voice. God is attentive to your life. And not only is he attentive, he is also able. It's one thing to come to the conclusion that God is sympathetic to your pain. It's quite another thing to come to the conclusion that he can actually do something about it. He's not just sympathetic, he's also sovereign. He is able. And so he goes on in verse five to say, it's not just what the Lord did, it's who the Lord is. Gracious is the Lord and righteous, our God, is merciful. When I was brought low, he saved me. You probably know this and you've probably heard this from this pulpit at some point, but the adage, God helps those who help themselves, it's not in the Bible. It may be true at some level, but it's not the foundational truth that you need to hear this morning. What you need to hear this morning is God helps those who cannot help themselves. The word grace means God helps those who don't deserve help. The word mercy means God helps those who have no way out. The word righteous means that even though we are unrighteous, even though all mankind are liars, Jesus is true and he is righteous and he keeps his promises to his people to be their shepherd even through the valley of the shadow of death. This is good for us to hear. It's good for us to hear that the psalmist even adds another line just to make sure that we understand this principle that God is able to help those who can't help themselves. Verse six, the Lord preserves the simple. If you were with us last summer, we studied Proverbs and we talked about simple people. In our vernacular, that means salt of the earth people or people who are just kind of keeping it simple. But in the Old Testament, a simple person was a naive person, a rash person, a fool, a knucklehead. What the psalmist is saying is the Lord gives help to knuckleheads so that if you're here this morning, you're like, well, I appreciate what you're saying, pastor, but God probably reserves his help for those who haven't gotten themselves into messes. The psalmist is like, no, no, I'm talking about when you messed up, when you put yourself in that situation, when you made the knuckleheaded choice, when you turned your back on God and decided to do it your own way. God helps us even when we act like simple fools. Isn't that great to think about that God isn't worried about enabling you? He doesn't size you up before he picks you up. It's like the climber climbing down into that crevice and pulling that or that guide going down there and pulling that climber out. He didn't check his resume before he went. He didn't scroll his social media to make sure he was worth saving. He just went. God just comes to those who are in need and rescues us. Here's what that means. It means that this psalm doesn't turn out to be just this explanation, high theology explanation of the mechanics of God's saving in some impersonal way. As if what's being described here is the cosmic equivalent of the arcade crane, you know that game where you move the crane out and you go get a prize, Toy Story, you know, the claw. Remember that part? That's not what's being described here. It's not cold, mechanical, impersonal, like the man upstairs just like looking out for me kind of thing. This is intensely personal. So much so that throughout this passage you'll notice that the Lord in our English translations is translated with all caps. And the reason it's translated with all caps is that's not just the translation of the word Lord, it's the translation of the name of God. That's the word Yahweh in Hebrew, which is being translated into the English for us to remind us over in verse one, in verse four, again in verse four, again in verse five, again in verse six, that we're not talking about a cold, impersonal deity. We're talking about the covenant Lord who met with Moses in Exodus chapter 34 and proclaimed his name on Mount Sinai and his name, if you go back and read Exodus 34, the Lord himself proclaiming it, the Lord, the Lord, that is Yahweh, Yahweh, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness. This is an intensely personal rescue. The Lord is attentive to me. He is attentive to you. He is able and willing because he is the faithful covenant Lord. The God of Moses, the God of Psalm 116 is your God. He is our God and he delivers those who are simple and brought low. So what does this mean for you? How do you remember your deliverance? Let me just give you one homework assignment now that it's summer and school is almost out. Some of you are just going to be eager to get back to homework. So let me give you a little homework. I would encourage you this week as you've thought more about this Psalm to pick a moment in your life that is, was clearly a deliverance of some sort. And I've given you a few categories to think about, but just pick one sometime, something in the past that you look back on it and you're like, just, there's no logical explanation for me being here today because of that, whether it was close call with death or just a close call with, with, uh, with anything else that felt like it was pulling you closer toward death. And, and I want you to write that down. I just want you to write it out. It doesn't have to be, you know, a five page essay. It can just be a couple sentences, a paragraph, but I want you to begin to understand that moment as you remember your deliverance. Think about that moment as a deliverance, not by the, the cosmic crane, but by the personal living God who heard you even if you weren't crying out to him at the time, but saw you and rescued you. Write that down. I'm thinking of that partly because this couple of weeks ago I was having a conversation with somebody about some challenges in their own life right now. And this is someone who was in the military and so I, we just started, I started asking him some to tell me some war stories. And at one point he was telling me about a couple situations he found himself in that, where he thought in the moment, this is it, like I'm not making it back from this. And he did. And they were harrowing stories. There were incredible stories of deliverance and rescue. And then he said this to me, he said, Ryan, those are the ones I know about. You can, you can pick a story you know about, but in the back of your mind, this is what I want you to be thinking. There are a lot more stories I don't know about. Stories in which the Lord has delivered me, rescued me, and I had no idea. If you do that, I, I'm confident you will arrive eventually to verse 12. And you will ask this question in your own words perhaps, but you're going to eventually get to this point where if you really believe the Lord rescued you, you're going to ask some version of this question. What shall I render to the Lord for all of his benefits to me? All right, let's just think about our Mount Everest climber for a second. When he finally comes to, what is, what is he going to say to the man who rescued him? You know, two enthusiastic thumbs up, high five, thanks for the lift, you know? No, he's going to, he's going to say, what could I possibly do to repay you for what you did for me? You name it. If I can do it, I will, I will do it. It is, it's, it's the logical question. If, if this really is our story, then, then, then the question that should be on the front of our minds all the time, all the time is, what can I possibly render unto the one who has rescued me? What can I possibly do? How do I respond? That's what I mean by consider your response. How do I respond to what the Lord has done for me? And I want us, I want you to see that the psalmist gives us two ways to think about this. First of all, that we would tell the Lord that we love him. That's how the psalm begins. I love the Lord. And I'm sure at this point, your Hebrew tolerance is about at its maximum, but I'll just give you one more insight. The first word of the psalm in Hebrew is the word love. I'm not breaking new ground here. This is often the way that verb constructs go in Hebrew. Nevertheless, it's worth emphasizing that word is love. The first word out of his mouth, love. I love you, Lord. Talk about intensely personal. It seems to me that a lot of us are more comfortable with other ways of talking to God. You know, like, I thank you, Lord, I praise you, Lord, I worship you, Lord, I revere you, I'm sorry. That's often the first prayer, I'm sorry. First word out of his mouth is love. I don't know if that's comfortable language for you or not. I think for many of us, that just feels too close, too familiar, too intimate, too vulnerable. But it's worth asking, and I don't mean this in any kind of corny, hokey way, but simply to ask all of us this morning, when was the last time we simply told the Lord that we loved him? I would think that if that is often the first word out of our mouth in response to him and all he's done for us, it would begin to change everything else. I would even suggest it would be like this runaway train. Once we begin to say, actually, my posture toward the Lord is one of love, intensely personal, passionate, visceral love, then it begins to change all the other words of worship and praise and obedience, which aren't bad words at all, but they're all expressions ultimately of love. Tell the Lord that you love him, and then second of all, tell others that you love him. You'll notice that everything that's listed here in verses 13 and verse 13 and following, everything he says he's going to do in response is public. This is not, again, this is not the psalmist writing these words down in his diary, locking it, hiding the key in the top drawer of his dresser, and sticking it under his mattress for someone to find later in life. He says, nope. I'm going to tell as many people as possible, as often as possible, what the Lord has done for me and that I love him unashamedly, without embarrassment, without qualification, without worrying people are going to think I'm some sort of nut or some sort of zealot, no. I'm just going to tell people to lift up the cup of salvation was a formal act of worship in the temple. To pay vows to the Lord, well, we just saw an example of that with our confirmation class, paying vows, and not just in a formal sense, but simply by being here in gathered worship, you are expressing with your body, with your presence, that it is the Lord who owns your heart. And if we missed it the first time, he repeats it again in verses 17 and 18, lift up the cup of salvation, pay my vows, all of it done in the courts of the house of the Lord in the midst of you, oh, Jerusalem. This is a public testimony. This is not a shy private faith. This is a faith that just works its way out in spoken, lived out testimony to the goodness of God. And he will have it no other way. He wants to tell others what God has done for him. And so this is the second part of the assignment. This is really just a two-part assignment, which is great. Not just one, but a two-part assignment. Write out your story of deliverance and then tell someone about it. If you're in a community group, maybe you set some time aside over the next few times together to share your story. Maybe for the person who wants to share six, awesome, you know, overachiever, maybe just share one so everyone can have a turn. If you're in a D group in our student ministry, just pick one, but set some time aside and have those conversations. Maybe at the family table, this is something you do over the summer, let's just pick one way the Lord met us in our need and have that conversation. Maybe you have a friend who doesn't know Jesus and what they really need to hear is the way God showed up in your life that one time. However you do it, the psalmist is urging us that in our response, we not only tell the Lord we love him, we tell others. Some of you, I suspect, have been, have had sort of this thought in the back of your head for a while since we started a few minutes ago. And the thought has gone something like this. I would love to be able to pray this and sing this with confidence, to recite this psalm and mean it, but my hang up, you say to yourself or you say to me, pastor, my hang up is that I have asked the Lord to deliver me and he hasn't. I've asked him to help me. And if I'm being completely honest, he hasn't. I've asked him to heal me or someone I love and he didn't. I've asked him to take away the thing I hate the most about my life and he hasn't. So it's very hard to pray in the present tense, something you haven't seen in the past tense. Right? Now look, if you're thinking that, I just want you to know, you're not alone in thinking that. If you, anyone here who's been a Christian for any length of time, we have been where you are. There are times God seems much more aloof and apathetic than present. I know that. You know that. And so it's at moments like this, it's really important that we remember something. It's important for us to remember that Jesus sang this psalm at a time in his life that felt a lot like the time you're experiencing in your own. You see, Psalm 16 is part of a set of psalms known as the Halal Psalms. That's from the Hebrew word. I'm sorry, one more Hebrew thing. Hebrew word praise, we get our word hallelujah. Psalms 113 to 118 were sung at every Passover meal before, during, and after. In fact, this is why in Matthew and Mark, we're told that after the Passover meal on the night Jesus was betrayed, he sang a psalm. You can go find the psalms, psalms 113 to 118 would have been the psalms they worked through that night. Psalm 116 is on that list, and so you need to know that Jesus himself, at the very moment when he knew that his father would not deliver him from what he feared the most, still prayed and sang this song with confidence. Because he knew that there was a greater deliverance. And Jesus himself knew that even as he praised the Lord and lifted the cup of salvation at that meal, he was about to lift a different cup. He prays about it in the garden. He says, Lord, take this cup from me. He's not talking about the cup of salvation, he's talking about the cup of judgment. That in order for you and I to be delivered from our sin, Jesus took the judgment we deserve. That in order for us to be delivered from death, Jesus allowed the snares of death to pull him all the way into the grave. In order for us to be rescued, Jesus was rejected. That means this morning that no matter what you're going through, no matter what the circumstances of your life might be, whether it seems like deliverance is close at hand or far away, we are still rescued people. That Jesus has delivered us from what threatens us the most, our sin, death. And it's not just this psalm that puts this into words, it's this table that puts it into bread and the cup so that together, as God's people, we might gather around this table, which reminds us that we are rescued people. We might celebrate the one who rescued us. Let me pray for us. Father, we thank you for this psalm. We thank you for this table. We thank you that you have rescued us, not because we deserve it, but because you are gracious and righteous and merciful. I pray now that as we come to this table, you might meet with us by your spirit. We ask it in Jesus' name, amen.
