Good morning. Our passage this morning is from the Gospel of Mark, chapter 12, beginning in verse 28. Before I read that passage for us, I want to take you back a few years to July of 1991. I had just graduated from high school, I know, and I was about to begin my time at West Point at the Military Academy as a freshman, as a plebe, and the first thing that happens is you arrive for what's called reception day, our day. We all gathered in this auditorium, me, my parents, along with several hundred of my classmates. We heard a speech, a very inspiring speech about how great the next eight weeks of our lives were going to be during that summer from the commanding officer, and then at the end of that speech, the officer said, families, you have 90 seconds to say goodbye to your candidates. We weren't cadets yet, we hadn't quite made it that far. We were candidates, and we had 90 seconds. So as you can imagine, the auditorium began to fill with noise as everyone stood up, and parents began to hug their kids, and shed a few more tears, and offer a few more words of encouragement, maybe a few prayers on behalf of their children. And as we were going through all of that, I could kind of feel the clock ticking in my head. It's about to happen, like it's going down. And my dad, who had graduated from West Point about 30 years before, and knew what I was getting into, he probably saw that look in my eye. It was probably the same look he had 30 years before. And as I looked at him, and the clock was ticking, he gave me a hug, and then extended his arms, grabbed me by the shoulders, and looked me in the eyes. And I knew what was about to happen. He was about to tell me everything I needed to know. Okay, he was gonna tell me everything I needed to know to survive. And trust me, I needed to hear it. And so he looks at me, and he says, Ryan, listen to directions. I'm not sure what you were expecting. I'm not really sure what I was expecting to hear in that moment. Maybe something a little more profound, something that would take me a little further than listen to directions. And I'm thinking, okay, if that's all it's going to take, this should be a cinch. It turns out that when you have people yelling at you, and multiple people yelling at you various directions, some of which are in conflict with each other, it's not as easy to follow directions as you might think. Like that turned out to be really good, important advice, and almost impossible to carry out. But he was right. If I could just do that, it would have been a cinch, but I couldn't just do that. In the passage we're about to read, Bill mentioned it a second ago, Jesus gives us that 90 second speech, okay? So if he were to grab you by the shoulders, and look you in the eye this morning, and say this, this is what you need to do with your life. With your life. This is it. If you do this thing, you will live a good life. And how does he answer? Mark chapter 12, beginning with verse 28. And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that Jesus answered them well, he asked Jesus, what commandment is the most important of all? Jesus answered, the most important is, hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength. And the second is this, you shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these. And the scribe said to him, you are right, teacher. You have truly said that he is one, and there is no other besides him. And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, you are not far from the kingdom of God. And after that, no one dared ask him any more questions. This is the word of the Lord. Yes, you are. Let's give him thanks and pray for our time. Father, we give you thanks for your word. You have not left it to us to figure out how to live, but you have shown us in your word. But we admit to you that even this morning, we may come into this place distracted, or preoccupied, or uninterested. And so we need you also now out of your love and mercy to open our eyes to this portion of your word that we might see you and respond the way you call us to respond in this passage with love. We ask it in Jesus' name, amen. Well, if you've been with us the last few weeks, you may remember that every time we've opened up to the gospel of Mark the last few weeks anyway, Jesus is having an argument with somebody. And so it's nice to finally meet Jesus not having an argument with somebody, and especially a religious person, because they seem to really get under Jesus' skin quite a bit. And we've learned the reasons why from Mark, because every question that they've been asking in the last couple chapters has been an interrogation, or a trap, or somehow tried to catch him in his words to get him in trouble, or even get him arrested, which was their goal, was to put him out of the picture. But here we have a scribe, an expert in the Old Testament law, someone who was an expert in what the law of God taught, coming to Jesus and asking a genuine question and getting a genuine answer. It's like refreshing that we have this honest dialogue about this most important topic. Now, the question he's answer, that this scribe is asking is a question that many of the rabbis and religious leaders and biblical scholars were asking at the time, and here's why. So when you think about the commandments, what do you normally think about in the Bible? You think about the 10 Commandments, right? And so the 10 Commandments are that reference point, even today for us, if we want to think about what a moral life looks like. And even in this time, that was often the way this conversation went. When a rabbi would answer this question, he'd point to one of the 10 Commandments, or how they fit together. But the scribe knew that actually, the scribes and other religious experts had identified 613 distinct commands in the Old Testament. So if you actually read through the Old Testament, if you get past Exodus 20, and you get the rest of Exodus, there are a lot of corollary laws that go along with that, that specify what it means not to steal, or not to bear false witness, or how to treat your neighbor. 613, that's a lot, like I can't keep track of 10. And they were trying to keep track and live in light of 613. This is a very practical question, like Jesus, help me out, whittle it down to one, if you please would. And Jesus does. And he answers the question by giving an answer that at first might seem a little underwhelming. Because the answer he gives is, well, all of the commandments really depend on love. Like at the end of the day, it's about loving God and loving others. It's kind of like my dad said, listen to instructions. Like our first instinct might be, oh, love? Well, I can do that. And then you go out in life, and you actually try to do that, and you realize it feels almost impossible to love God the way that Jesus is talking about here and to love other people as ourself. How do we do that? And how does this answer actually help deepen our understanding of what it means to live a good life? And so this morning, what I wanna do is show you how Jesus's answer actually deepens our understanding of two things, what God expects of us and what God connects for us, what he expects of us and what he connects for us. So first of all, the question behind the question here is from the scribe, what does God expect of me? Like, what is he asking me to do? That may or may not be a live question in your life. I don't know where you're coming from spiritually, but even if you don't frame the question that way, I think deep down, all of us want our lives to count for something. You know, we want our lives to be seen as respectable and not even respectable, but even noble. There's this longing in our human hearts for our lives to be assessed and evaluated in a positive way. And so Jesus is answering this question out of the Jewish tradition. He's going back to the Old Testament. So even though he doesn't quote one of the 10 commandments, he quotes two passages in the Old Testament here and he puts them together. The first is Deuteronomy 6. That's where the command to love God comes from. And the second is Leviticus 19. That's where the command to love your neighbor comes from. And he puts these together and he says, this is what God expects of you. This is one of those places in which, if you look at the other gospels, there are four gospel accounts. And sometimes they tell the same story in a slightly different way, just sort of like a different angle on the conversation. And in the gospel of Matthew chapter 22, we have the same account. And in that account, we have this wonderful phrase that Jesus says, on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. That's a helpful way of understanding what Jesus is saying and what he's not saying, all right? So for him to narrow down all of the commandments, all of the law to love, does not mean that he's throwing out all the law. Okay, he's not saying all those other laws, yeah, forget about those. Don't worry about those, just love and you're good. Now what Jesus is saying is all of those laws are about love. All the law is pointing us toward the work of love, loving God and loving others. Now, when you actually begin to test this out against the laws you can readily find. So if you were to look at Exodus chapter 20 start working through the 10 commandments, like for example, the commandment, you shall not steal. Now, I think for most of us, that doesn't sound immediately like a command to love. It doesn't really feel like romance poetry, does it? You shall not steal. It feels very much like, all right, what I'm being told there is I shouldn't take other people's stuff. Parents, you're trying to teach your little kids to share their toys. Or actually before you even get to that, don't take your little brother or little sister's toy. Don't take their food when they're not looking, like keep your paws on your own stuff and don't take other people's stuff. And then later on, as we get older, we get into high school and we're told by our teachers not to plagiarize, not to take someone else's words and steal them and act like they're ours. And then we get into the corporate world and we're told, hey, don't steal pencils from the office and don't steal time from your employer and don't embezzle money from your company. Don't steal. Now, the wisdom of the ages, Christian theology has taught us to say, well, but the commands are actually going further than prohibiting certain things. The commands actually have a positive requirement as well. For example, if you look at the Westminster Larger Catechism and its explanation of the 10 commandments and you begin to read through there, what it does is it says, what does this commandment prohibit? Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot. What does this commandment require of you? So, it's not enough simply to say, well, I didn't take anybody's stuff. There's also an expectation that you share, that you be generous, that you be fair in your transactions, that you be fair in your contract, that when the waiter brings you the check and they didn't put that extra soda that you ordered, it's not on the check, you flag the waiter down and you say, I don't want to take something for free. So, you need to put that on it and I'll pay for it. I know you all did that last night when you went out to dinner, right? Because you know the commandment, you shall not steal. And when you begin to see the negative and the positive aspects of even the 10 commandments, you begin to see they both derive from the same principle, which is to love God and love your neighbor as yourself. Let me just put it this way. You cannot fulfill the law without love. The reason we do not steal is because we love God. And we know that the person that we're interacting with who has the thing that we want to take for our own, even though it doesn't belong to us, that person is made in God's image. And if that person is a fellow Christian, they have been bought by the precious blood of Christ. And because we love God, we don't want to do violence to the person God has made in his image. And furthermore, we love God because he provides all things for us. And we trust him that he's given us all that we need. So, we don't need to go take it for ourselves. And the commandment to love is not just to not do bad things to our neighbor, like chuck trash over the fence or pour our grass clippings on our neighbor's side of the yard. It is to seek the welfare actively of our neighbor. And just in case you're wondering and you're starting to do the inventory, when Jesus defines neighbor, he just doesn't mean the person who lives next door to you. You see, we cannot fulfill the law without love. Just a place to explore this more if you're interested is Romans chapter 13, the beginning of the chapter. Paul, the apostle is going through the commandments. He named several of them. And then he concludes his little speech on the commandments with this sentence. Therefore, love is fulfilling the law. Now, this is not what we expect God to expect of us. Sorry, I know that's confusing. That's not what we expect God to expect of us. For a couple of different reasons. Because we live in a culture that tells us that rules and laws are the opposite of love. You know, our culture is more Beatles than Moses when it comes to love, right? Love, love, love. All you need is love. All you need, all you need is love. Now, what does that mean? It means you don't need rules. You don't need laws. You certainly don't need authorities telling you what to do. You don't need a God telling you this is what's expected of you. You don't need parents telling you the right thing to do. You don't need institutions. Being heavy, man. Just back off and let us love. But see, the problem with that way of thinking about love is that it doesn't actually work. Because, I don't know about you, but I find myself in situations all the time in which I don't know what the loving thing to do is. I don't know. When you're in conflict with somebody and that person's mad at you and you're mad at them, what's the loving thing to do? Is it to pretend like everything's okay? All you need is love, let's just love? Is it to talk it out? Is it to wait for that person to apologize? Is it to scream and yell and get in her face? Like, what's the loving thing to do? When you have a friend who's dealing with a compulsive habit or an addiction, what's the loving thing to do? When you have an aging parent who, by the way, isn't listening to your advice on what to do, what's the loving thing to do? And this is why, when Jesus says, you can't fulfill the law without love, it's also true of saying that the law provides guidance. You know, it directs the current of our love in the direction of actually benefiting the person before us. And not only that, but there are others of us who hear what God expects, and our response is more like, well, all this talk of love feels very touchy-feely to me. Like, just tell me what I need to do. Tell me where I need to be. Tell me what God expects me to do, and I will do it. And I'll give you a spreadsheet and a Gantt chart, and I'll show you all the ways that I'm doing exactly what God wants me to do. But remember what Jesus says here. You cannot fulfill the law simply by external behavior. You must accompany what you do with who you love. So that many of us get in this place in our lives where we are evaluating our Christian obedience based solely on what we do, and we've forgotten that we can do the right thing with a hard heart, and with a heart that resents God, and resents our neighbor, and feels self-righteous toward people. It's like a little boy, a little four-year-old boy who's at the dinner table, and he was misbehaving, and so his parents told him to sit down. He didn't do it. Please sit down. He didn't do it. You need to sit down. You're gonna be in a timeout. He finally sits down. He has that look on his face. You know, if you're a parent, or if you've been around little kids, you know that look. And after a few minutes, he looked at his dad, and he goes, I may be sitting down on the outside, but I'm standing up on the inside. And that's how many of us live with God. We're doing it, but not with a heart of love. Jesus says, this is what is expected of you. This is what God's always expected of his people, God's always expected of his people, to love God, to love others. That's what God expects. And then notice what God connects for us. God connects for us what we tend to separate. The scribe asks for a commandment, and he gets a two for one. He asked for the greatest commandment, and Jesus gives him two, but then again, he kind of gives him one. Okay, he gives him two, love God, love others, but notice the way that Jesus says it, or finishes his answer in verse 31. There is no other commandment greater than these. Okay, questionable grammar, good theology. Jesus is connecting loving God and loving neighbor. He's saying, these always go together. You cannot do one without doing the other. So just think, for example, about how he talks about loving God. He begins in verse 29 with this statement. Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. Now, this was an ancient Jewish prayer. It actually was more of a confession of faith. It would be more like our Apostles' Creed. It was called the Shema, from the word hear, and pious Jews would recite this in the morning and in the evening. Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. This is where the whole conversation about loving God begins. It begins with a confession of who God is. Okay, so loving God isn't just having like vague notions of affection for the universe. Okay, it's not just like an attitude of gratitude. It's not hashtag blessed. It begins with a robust understanding of who God is. He is majestic and holy and glorious and what he's done in his mercy. He has rescued his people from slavery. So our affection for God is grounded, always grounded in our confession of who he is. That's why reading the Bible and loving God and loving neighbor go hand in hand. This is not merely an intellectual exercise. This is how we are reminded every single day of who God is and how worthy he is of all of our heart and all of our strength and all of our soul and all of our mind so that we can respond to who God is the way David does in the Psalm we read earlier in Psalm 18. I love you, Lord, my strength, my rock, or the way Jesus says it here. Lord, I love you with everything I have. That is to say we can't pull apart from this whole conversation a love for God which is grounded in who he is, but right alongside that, we can't pull out love for neighbor. From that love, Jesus connects the two. They are of one fabric. That is to say you can't obey the great commandment without loving your neighbor. If we're just a little soft on this or not exactly clear, that's what Jesus is saying. In 1 John chapter four, the apostle John shows up like the blunt uncle at Thanksgiving who just says it like it is. In 1 John chapter 4, 19, John just says it like it is. We love, why? Because he first loved us. If anyone says I love God and hates his brother, he is a liar. Whoever loves God must love his brother. If you're here this morning and you're a Christian, then I think you probably know this is true because you see the impulse in your own heart, but we certainly see it in the wider church that Christians have somehow got it in our brains that we can somehow demonstrate how much we love God in ways other than the way we love our neighbor. It's like, Lord, just look at my Bible reading plan. Like it's mostly checked off. And look at my podcast library. There are robust and precise theological and biblical content on there. And I go on a mission trip every single year and just go tell people about Jesus. And I lead a community group and people I think like being my community group and my attendance record, not to brag, but my attendance record at church is pretty good. It's certainly better than a lot of people. And I always fill out the getting connected pad. I do that every single week and the whole thing. As if we could pursue all of those religious activities and more and not have love as if God would say, yeah, that's good enough, no. Jesus says that for us to love God means that we are loving our neighbors. You see all of those things that I just described to you, those are not bad in and of themselves. I don't want you hearing me say that, but by themselves, they are not the demonstration that you love God. What does Jesus say here? What does John say later? To love God means that we are going to love our neighbors or just go to the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 13. So the next time you're at a wedding, you're gonna read the love passage, most likely just back up a little bit because that's when it really gets, that's when the strong medicine hits in the first couple of verses where Paul says, I could do everything that would give everyone around me the sense that I am the biggest lover of God in the world. But if I do not have love in my heart, doesn't matter. How many of you remember the gong show? All right. Like what Paul is saying is, I can do all of these external things that make people think that I'm the greatest Christian of the world, but if I don't have love, gong, right? No, I'm just a clanging gong, a clashing cymbal. And at the same time, we have to recognize that many of us as Christians have gone in the opposite direction. We've said, well, then we're just gonna give our lives to loving our neighbors. And many of you moved to this town for the purpose of lifting people out of poverty and putting them in the presence of better public policy or working for better schools or working in schools or caring about the law in such a way that loves our neighbor and we pursue those things and those are good things. But if that does not flow out of a heart that is connected to the source of inexhaustible love, what happens? We get cynical, we become self-righteous because no one else cares about the things that we care about like the things we care about them or we get discouraged or we find out that, you know, people aren't really all that pleasant all the time or lovable. The only way we are going to love the way Jesus says, we're to love is as we experience for ourselves the radical steadfast love of God. It's the only way. He's putting back together what we so easily pull apart. Look, at the end of the day, when you read the great commandment, what it really does is expose our greatest need because I don't love like this. I don't love God with all my heart and soul and strength and mind. There are thoughts I'm ashamed of. There are words I wish I could take back. I don't love my neighbor as myself. On my good days, maybe I get close. He got close to the kingdom of God on his good day. Maybe on my good days, I get close, but there are a lot of bad days too. This exposes my great need for Jesus because I may not have loved like this. You may not love like this, but you have been loved like this. On the cross, Jesus gave himself for his neighbors and not just his neighbors, but his enemies. Those who were far from him, God showed you love through Christ so that we might not only be forgiven of our sin, but we might be liberated to show love toward God and toward others. You know, all those years ago, when my dad was talking to me in that crowded auditorium, he had a few seconds to tell me everything I needed to know. When he grabbed me by the shoulders and looked me in the eye, those words proved to be true and actually maybe surprisingly proved to be true. It was something profound, but it wasn't just his words that mattered the most. What mattered the most in that moment was his love for me. The fact that the person speaking those words had known me longer than anyone else in the world, that he had prayed for me before I was born, that he knew me inside and out, that he knew what I was getting myself into and that he would be with me every step of the way. It was a father's love that sustained me as much as those words did. I knew who was speaking those words and the one who was speaking those words knew me. And this morning, as we come to this table, the one who calls us to give ourselves to the work of love out of a heart that is passionate, for he knows you, he loves you, he's never gonna leave you, he delights in you and he brings us to this table to give us a taste once again of that love that we might give the world a taste of it ourselves. Heavenly Father, as we come to this table this morning, we come with needy hearts, hearts that need to be refreshed by your love, hearts that recognize that we have failed, to live up to this greatest of all commandments and yet hearts that desire in the deepest parts of us to conform to your will and live in your way that we might live as ambassadors of Christ and his love. We pray in Jesus' name, amen.
