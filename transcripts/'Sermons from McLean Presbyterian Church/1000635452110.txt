Good morning, our scripture reading this morning is Galatians chapter six, verses one through 10. You can find this passage in the Bibles we provided for you there in your seat on page 975, Galatians six, one through 10. Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself lest you too be tempted. Bear one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ. For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. But let each one test his own work and then his reason to boast will be in himself alone and not in his neighbor, for each will have to bear his own load. Let the one who is taught the word share all good things with the one who teaches. Do not be deceived. God is not mocked. For whatever one sows, that will he also reap. For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption. But the one who sows to the spirit will from the spirit reap eternal life. Let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap if we do not give up. So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone, and especially to those who are of the household of faith. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Let's pray. Father, I pray that these words would form us and shape us more into the image of Jesus. Help us now to give attention to what you are teaching us because we know that you love us and you care for us and you've given us your word here in this moment that we might take this opportunity to do good and not grow weary. We ask it in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, if we haven't met yet, my name is Ryan. I'm the senior pastor here. It's a pleasure to open up God's word with you. We have also, if you haven't been with us, we've been studying this book of Galatians for this fall season, and we are down to our last two sermons in Galatians this week and next week, and it's somewhat appropriate that we are finishing up at this time of the year on these two passages because these two sermons, these two texts in Galatians 6 really bookend Thanksgiving week for us. So we have this week and then we have Thanksgiving, and then next week, if you come back for our Thanksgiving service. At my previous church, we had a Thanksgiving service, and it was the one service during the year that I didn't preach. We just had like testimonies of Thanksgiving and songs and things like that, and people would often remark to me that it was their favorite service of the whole year. And while I am gonna preach next week, all right, it still may be your favorite service of the year because it'll be a little shorter and we'll have a chance to hear from each other, and that is very important, and I get why they said that because it is always a good thing as a community, as a church community, to be together and to hear what God is doing in our lives. It's just incredibly encouraging. So I'm excited for next week. But this week isn't always the easiest week of the year, right, because sharing a table with somebody, depending on who those people are, is a blessing and can also be something of a challenge, but so it is with all kinds of community. I mean, every relationship is both a blessing and a challenge, and some, you know, a little more one than the other, and maybe you're already thinking about that, and that is why this passage, which is laying out for us this vision of what it looks like for the gospel of Jesus to shape community is so timely for us, and I hope is encouraging to you. I was reading an article or listening to an interview, I don't remember, about someone who got really, really into making chili, like that became his thing, and he became so good at it that he eventually took his chili to the World Championship Chili Cook-Off, which takes place every year, and there he is with all of these past winners, you know, who have won cash prizes because their chili was so tasty, and what was remarkable to him about that community is how much people shared information, like this just, this was odd to him that here they are in the midst of this very heated competition, don't mind the pun, but you know, very heated competition, and there are people who are experts at making chili who are sharing recipes and like giving tips on how to make your chili a little better than it is, and then he kind of sat back and he's like, well, this kind of makes sense, because the only reason you would wanna make your chili good is to share it with other people. I mean, most people don't make a big pot of chili for themselves, maybe you do, but like, maybe you do, but most of us don't, like the reason we make a big pot of chili and we wanna make it better is because we want other people to enjoy it, it's like it's made to be shared, and that idea just infiltrated this whole community, and it was so unusual to him because he was coming out of a life that was marked by striving, and I would think most of us in this room know something about what it means to be in communities in which everyone is striving, like this competitive edge to everything, this sense that whether you signed up for it or not, if you live in an area like this, you are in the comparison game all the time, like how you look, how you measure up, how you succeed, what your grades are, your accomplishments, your resume, you're always looking to the left and the right to derive your sense of self-worth, it's just like in the water, and what we learned from the book of Galatians, this letter that Paul wrote to this church in the first century in modern-day Turkey is that, surprise, surprise, this is not a DC problem, or a geographic issue, or merely a cultural issue, that certainly affects things, but this is just a human problem because when Paul is writing this letter, he eventually gets to these themes of community. In chapter five, he talks about the fact that in this church, there are people who are acting like wild animals, who are biting and devouring each other with their words, they're so competitive, he says, at the end of chapter five, this is the verse before, the verse where we started, verse 26, they become conceited, they're provoking each other, envying each other, and we see it again in this passage, that there is this warning that when we make our lives about striving, and that's where we get our deepest sense that we're worth something, there are these toxic communal effects. So Paul has been preaching against this from the first verse of this letter, he's been saying, actually, when it comes to your relationship with God, don't believe those false teachers who are telling you that you just need to keep striving in order to earn God's favor or prove that you're worthy of his love, he goes, that's nonsense, that's not the gospel, the gospel is that our worth is anchored in the righteousness of Jesus, which is given to us and received by faith. But then he goes on to say, and if you want evidence of where a life of striving leads, just look to the way it affects your relationships, even in the church. So the solution that he gives is not, you know, just make a big pot of chili, or just get along, or find some common ground, his solution is to bring the gospel in front of us again, and to say, actually, it's the gospel that shapes us into a culture not of striving, but a culture of sharing, in which we share our very lives with each other. I mean, that's what this community ought to be, not just a place where we share ideals, and commitments, and theological abstracts, but where we actually share our lives with each other. And this morning, I wanna talk about what that looks like, because Paul is incredibly practical in this passage. And he gives us very practical advice as to what it means for the gospel to shift us from a culture of striving to a culture of sharing. Sharing our burdens with each other, sharing our brokenness with each other, sharing our blessings with each other. So Paul starts by laying out this principle of the gospel calls us to share our burdens with each other. You see it in that principle he lays out, and then he works with it on either side of the verse, verse two, bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. The image here is the image of a weight that is too heavy for one person to carry. So this past weekend, we had some friends over from the neighborhood for an event, and so we had to move some heavy furniture out of one room and into another room. And so I enlisted my son, said, hey man, we gotta move some stuff. And I looked at this big couch, I said, I could move that by myself if I felt like it, but I don't feel like it, so I need your help. Like, let's bear this weight together. Or maybe some of you, as the Christmas presents start to get mailed in, maybe in your garage at some point, there's gonna be a big cardboard box, maybe there's a basketball hoop in there, or a shed for dad, or something like that. And it's gonna have that logo on it with the two people lifting, you know, or the four people lifting. This is a two-person or four-person lift. So you can try to lift that by yourself if you want, but that is against medical advice to do something like that, right? You need more people to lift the weight. That's the image that Paul is giving us here, that in life, we all encounter burdens that require help to carry. That is universally true. And we can act like, I got it, I can handle it, I can do it myself, but if there were a label on that burden, it would be two-person lift, like, or four-person lift. This requires more than just your sheer willpower and strength, so the burden of grief that some of you carried into this room, the burden of losing a parent, the burden of infertility, the burden of a miscarriage, the burden of anxiety and depression that you just can't talk your way out of, the burden of a failed relationship. Like, we bring all of those burdens into this place, and some of you are trying to carry that burden all by yourself. And the beauty of Christian community is that it is your Christian brothers and sisters, Paul says, who are called by the gospel to look at you and say, no, no, no, your burden is my burden. Your burden is my burden. This is why Paul connects in verse two, bearing burdens with fulfilling the law of Christ. You're thinking, wait a second, if you've been with us, like, wait a second, I thought we left, I thought we left the law behind, like way back in chapter one. Why are we talking about the law being something we now fulfill? It's because Paul has already defined for us that we're not saved by keeping the law, but because we're saved, we keep the law out of love and gratitude to God. And when Jesus was asked to sum up the entire law, he said, the whole law could be summed up in loving God and loving your neighbor as yourself. You see, Paul is connecting something here. He's saying, not only did Jesus summarize the law that way, Jesus modeled it for us. Like, the reason we bear each other's burdens, the reason we look at each other and say, your burden is now my burden, is because that's how Jesus treated us. He bore the burden we could not carry ourselves, the burden of our sin. Peter puts it like this in 1 Peter 2. Jesus himself bore our sins in his body on the cross that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. Now, all those burdens I listed, we could keep going. There are other weights that bear us down and that are weighing you down today. The one that Paul has in mind is the one he lists in verse one. Brothers or brothers and sisters, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. So, the burden he has in mind is the burden of a brother or sister who has messed up royally, who has blown it, who has fallen on her face, fallen on his face spiritually, who has sinned, who has engaged in some of these works of the flesh that are listed in verse 19, just to kind of activate your imagination as to the sorts of things that Paul has in mind. And Paul's response to this is that too is a burden that we are to share with one another. The language he uses here is the language of restoring him. And the people who are to restore this brother or sister are those who are spiritual. And so, when you hear Paul say that, you're thinking, okay, these must be like the super spiritual people, you know, like the Christian special forces who are like deployed into just these kind of situations. But again, if you've been paying attention, Paul has been very clear that by those who are spiritual, he means those who are filled with the spirit, which means every Christian on earth. Like there is no other kind of Christian than a spirit-filled Christian. So, this is a command to all of us that when we see a brother or sister in Christ fail, sin, fall into transgression, we are to restore, that word means to mend, we are to mend, to restore them. And notice how Paul guards us against two common responses, okay? So, he says, we are to restore them how? With the spirit of gentleness. Okay, not with the spirit of condemnation, not by walking up to them and being like, what, how could you do something like that? Shocked, baffled, and in many senses, looking down and saying, well, good thing you have me here to help and to sort all of this out for you. No, he says you are to restore that brother or sister in a spirit of gentleness, which by the way, is on the list of the fruit of the spirit. That's not just being a nice person, that's being a spirit-filled person that we would be gentle in restoring brothers and sisters in the same way that Jesus restored us, not with harshness and condemnation, but with grace and love. That's one reaction, Paul's saying, don't do it that way. Paul's also saying, don't just sit there and do nothing, which I think is what many of us think love often looks like in these situations. It's just to say, well, you know, I'm just not gonna get involved, it's just not really my problem, I'm not going to bother this person, they clearly have some issues, but you know, we all have issues. No, Paul is saying love requires entering in and restoring gently. And so this just ought to provoke, I think, all kinds of questions for us, and perhaps the most simple. As you look at the brothers and sisters in Christ in your life, who is carrying a burden you can share? And as you look at your own life, what burdens are you carrying that you need to share? That you can finally stop saying, okay, I got this. I'm good, even though it's a four-person lift, I'm good, I'm gonna struggle, I'm just gonna exhaust myself, try to carry this all by myself, when Paul says, no, actually, what it looks like to be shaped by the gospel is to live in a community where we really bear each other's burdens, even the rough stuff, like what's being described here. Now, right along with this, Paul says, not only do we share our burdens, we also share our brokenness. And I almost just kind of put those together because Paul puts these together, but I wanted to pull this out because Paul goes out of his way to say, in order for us to bear each other's burdens well, and out of a desire to love one another, it has to be matched with an awareness of our own brokenness so that as we walk with each other, we don't walk with each other in a way that encourages us to look down on other people in a sense of superiority or looking up to other people in a sense of inferiority. That's what Paul's talking about in verse 26 when he says, let's not become conceited, provoking each other or envying each other. Looking down or looking up. Instead, he says, we need to be honest about our brokenness. It's interesting in verse one that right after he gives this command to restore each other, he says this, keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted. It's Paul's way of saying, don't enter into that relationship or that conversation and give off the sense that you could never do such a thing. Because the fact is that you could. That we're not immune to temptation. We're not immune to falling into sin ourselves. Maybe the exact same one. And so we're honest. We're honest about our brokenness. And we're also humble. Verse three, he goes on to say, again, this is all just kind of embedded in the same command. For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. Well, that packs a little bit of a punch, doesn't it? If anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. I sort of think of this as like the fortune cookie you don't expect to open, you know? So like your friend opens up one and it says, you know, an exciting opportunity lies before you. You're like, oh, great. Well, what does yours say? Well, mine says, if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. Like, what's that about? And you really don't expect this from Paul who has been saying, look, I'm telling you, like God really delights in you because he's adopted you into his family. But Paul is not saying here like, hey, just remember, you're nothing. Like you need to really keep that in mind. Like you're really not worth anything. Paul's actually saying, remember why you are worth so much to God. It's not because of your awesomeness. It's not because you didn't fall into the temptation your friend did. It's because of what Jesus has done for you. And as he's gonna say in the next chapter, we'll get to this next week, that's the reason you have to boast. You don't boast in yourself. You boast in Jesus because he is your righteousness. Because this isn't like, this isn't Paul just sort of putting us in our place. This is Paul actually empowering us with honesty and humility about our desperate need for Jesus our shared desperate need for Jesus. That doesn't send you to the ground groveling. That actually gives you new life because it means that there's no more pressure for you to like prove yourself to other people or to strive in such a way that people notice how excellent you are, how spiritual you are. You don't have to present yourself as having it all together. You can be honest. You can be honest about your need for Jesus. The German reformer Martin Luther said this about his own church. May a merciful God preserve me from a Christian church in which everyone is a saint. I want to be and remain in the church and the little flock of the faint hearted, the feeble, the ailing who feel and recognize the wretchedness of their sins, who sigh and cry to God incessantly for comfort and help and who believe in the forgiveness of sins. I hope you feel the same way that that's the kind of church you want to be part of too. Who share in our burdens and with it our brokenness and finally share our blessings. In the second paragraph, Paul is working off another principle. This one may be derived from the farming world or the gardening world, whatever your vibe is. Verse seven, do not be deceived. God is not mocked for whatever one sows, that will he also reap. Also, not a very grace-filled verse. So like what is Paul doing here? Is this the old switcheroo, right? Was it grace, grace, grace, grace, grace for five and a half chapters? And then he's like, eh, actually you get what you deserve. It's like, wait a second. I thought the whole point of grace is that we don't get what we deserve. I thought Paul's point the whole time has been actually your relationship with God is based on not what you sow into your life, but what Jesus gives you. Well, one way to think about that is to say, well, actually no, Paul isn't undoing grace. He's actually explaining it from a different angle. That is to say the scandal of grace. Like what's really scandalous about it, what really gets your attention, what really wakes you up is the fact that grace says that you sow sin into your life and selfishness into your life. And so you deserve to reap a harvest of death and separation from God forever. And yet you don't get, you don't get the harvest of what you sow. You get the harvest of what Jesus sowed. That's the great transfer of the gospel that Jesus sows righteousness in love, not us, but we get to share in his great harvest. So this principle of the harvest is still in play when it comes to how we are saved. But Paul isn't thinking so much about that. Now he's thinking how it is that we live. So if grace is functional in the way that we're saved, now Paul is saying this is the way that grace kind of works out in the way that you live. And this principle actually we can understand. In a sense, we all get that when it comes to a community, you get out what you put in. This is generally true. So the other day I was at the fall sports extravaganza celebration at my son's school and all of the coaches got up and they talked about their teams and how great the kids did and all of that. And I will tell you, not one coach, not one coach got up and said, look, I'll be honest, the kids, like they just never practiced. They never practiced. And when they did, they had like this terrible attitude. And on game day, I was like, just kind of surprised if they'd even show up. And we won everything. Like I can't explain it, but they didn't put anything in, but they got all this stuff out. So there's a life lesson for you kids. There's a life lesson, right? No one said that. Everyone, everyone said the same thing, basically. These kids have been working so hard, summer workouts, in the weight room, on the track. They've sacrificed their time. And look, look at the harvest that they received. What? What they put in, they got out. We understand this is the way that life works. And Paul is saying, and it's no different when it comes to our life together. You get out what you put in. And Paul is saying, when you share your blessings with others, you get blessings in return. Now, let me just say very clearly that there are ways in which this principle and this verse is twisted and abused among certain preachers and in some churches today. So sometimes you will hear this verse used as a justification for saying, hey, if you give us your money, if you sow a seed financially, you're gonna get a lot of money back, right? It's like sow the seed and God will bless you and with either health or with wealth. And that's nonsense, that's not what I'm saying. And we can talk about why that's nonsense after if you have questions about it. No, what Paul is saying here is that there are tangible blessings that we receive in Christian community when we share our blessings with others. And he gives us two examples. The first example, ironically enough, does have to do with your wealth, okay? So he says in verse six, let the one who is taught the word, that's you, share all good things with the one who teaches. That's me. Thank you for that nervous laughter. This is a little awkward, I'm not gonna lie. It's a little awkward to preach on this text, but Paul says this in other places as well. And so it's really not all that awkward at all because yes, would a principle like that be open to abuse both by a congregation and by a pastor? Absolutely 100%, but it doesn't have to be because the idea here is simply this, like by financially supporting the church, one of the things you allow is for pastors and teachers and other people and children's and student ministry and around the church in their teaching ministry to sow the word of God into your life faithfully. So by supporting the work of the church, you're allowing me during the week, it's not all I do, but one of the things I do is study the word, prepare the sermon, preach the sermon, recover from preaching the sermon, you know, study again, preach all that. Like you're allowing me the time and space to do that and not have to go get another job where, you know, to make ends meet so that I can faithfully sow the word of God in you. Which is not so much me blessing you is the Holy Spirit blessing you so that the word of God might dwell in you richly. So this idea of sowing and reaping is embedded in what he's saying here, that by sharing your wealth, that's one of the ways that God returns blessing into your life. Secondly, it's not just your wealth that we share, it's also our works. In verses nine and 10, Paul says, let's not grow weary of doing good. Verse 10, as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone. Paul could have simply said, hey, Christian, brother or sister, go do good. You know you're supposed to do good, so you're supposed to do good, so do good, just go do it. And we would have said, got it, we should go do good. What do I do good? How do I do good? And yet Paul is a helpful, kind, savvy pastor and so he gives us some very specific principles as to how this happens. Verse nine, notice what he says. Let us not grow weary of doing good. I don't know about you, but I need to hear that. I grow weary of doing good. I get tired of just doing good all the time. Because the distance between sowing and reaping when it comes to doing good, that distance can be like miles, years, generations. Like it'd be one thing if every time I unloaded the dishwasher without being asked, I got like a $10 Amazon gift card, okay? Like that would be one thing. I could do good for a while if that were the situation, right? Maybe that's the way it works in your house, I don't know, it's not the way it works in our house, you know, we try to say thank you and all that, but we don't always get around to it and not everybody notices all the good that you do. And so we can get tired of being like, I'd rather just like do my own thing instead of putting yourself out there and doing good. And yet Paul says, do not grow weary, why? Because there is a harvest you don't know about going on. Okay? You're not just taking seeds and throwing them to the wind when you actively serve people. What you're doing is you are reaping a harvest of godly character. Like the spirit is making you more and more like Jesus as you choose to give your life away in very practical acts of service. And not only that, we know there's a harvest coming because Jesus promises all who trust in him will one day hear, well done, good and faithful servant. Now your good works aren't earning that, you already have that because of Jesus, but that harvest and the eternity that stretches on beyond it is motivation for us to do the simple act of service in front of us, even if no one notices. The second practical guidance that Paul gives us here is found in verse 10, as we have opportunity. I love that, I love that. Paul will often do this in his letters where he'll say, look, I'm not asking you to do everything. I'm not asking you to help every needy person. I'm not asking you to fix every problem. I'm just asking you to do the thing that's in front of you. Those divine appointments that God sets up in your life as you have opportunity. Do good, do good to the people who do good to you. No, do good to everyone. And especially to those in the household of faith, especially to those who are brothers and sisters in Christ. I love the language of household. It's just a reminder that whether we're married or single, whether we're a widow, widower, whether we're divorced, whether we want to be married and aren't married, whatever our station in life, we are brothers and sisters in Christ, and this is a place that we express that and we fulfill that as we do good to one another. Now look, the holidays are upon us. As I mentioned, as you well know, it means all of those commercials are soon to be on television and social media and everywhere else that will lend some gentle cultural pressure for you to be in the spirit of giving, right? That you need to get into the holiday spirit. What does that mean? Be more generous, be less selfish, give extravagant gifts, you know, a car with a bow on it in the driveway, all that stuff. Like get with the program, all right? This is like the one time the world is gonna kind of agree with the Apostle Paul in this passage. Like, yeah, this is what your life should be about. Do you think you're something? When you're nothing, you're deceived. Like, don't be so conceited, don't be so selfish, don't be such a Scrooge. But you know what? That's gonna last for like eight weeks, that culture of sharing. And then we're all gonna take a break and we're gonna come back into the new year and it's off to the races again and we're back to the culture of striving. Paul's not just giving you a fad or some advice, he's actually telling you what it looks like to keep in step with the spirit of God. That our lives together are now marked by this remarkable, open-handed generosity of life as we share our burdens, as Jesus bore ours. As we share our brokenness, as Jesus met us in our brokenness, as we share our blessings, as Jesus has shared all of his blessings with us. Let me pray for us. Father, we thank you again for your word that it speaks to us with the power of the truth and the testimony of the Holy Spirit. We pray, Lord, that you would help us to live out well what you've given us, these challenging words that you've given us today, Lord, that these would not be added burdens that my friends here wouldn't leave saying, wow, okay, I got a lot of stuff to do. But instead, it would just add this clarity to what you've already given us to do. This clarity of heart and mind that the aim of our lives would be the aim of love. It would become second nature for us to ask the question, what does love require of me here and now with the person who is in front of me here and now? Lord, help us not to grow weary in doing good, but as we have opportunity to do good to all that many might know and see that you, Lord Jesus, are a good and gracious king. We ask it in Jesus' name, amen.
