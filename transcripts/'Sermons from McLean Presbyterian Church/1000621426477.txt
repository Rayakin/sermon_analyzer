Father, by your spirit, give us light to see, to hear, and to be changed through the preaching of your holy word. This we ask in Jesus' name. Amen. Trust. Trust. It is an ache inside each and every one of us, children, teenagers, and adults. It is the yearning to confide in someone else or to share something significant about you with someone else. Who do you trust when it really counts? When you're hurting, heartbroken, ashamed, when life falls apart, when you've received soul-crushing news, when you feel the circumstances of life have you backed into a corner, who do you trust? Who do you turn to? What do you turn to? Psalm 56 teaches us to trust, to trust God. In this psalm, we're going to see three things today, a life in crisis, our response to life in crisis, and the Lord's provision. The first thing we see in Psalm 56 is a life in crisis. David. David's life is in crisis. Well, how do we know David's life is in crisis? We see that his life is in danger daily according to Psalm 56. He says he is being attacked, trampled on. He's got enemies who attack him proudly, he says. Enemies hate you. Enemies are our adversaries. They are against you. They seek, they hope for you to have negative, terrible life circumstances. An enemy is not a friend. These enemies, they twist David's words, seeking to injure his cause and his calling, which we will get to in a moment. Their thoughts are totally against David. They want evil. They want calamity. They want harm for David. Notice in verse 6, look down at verse 6. They stir up strife, attack. They lurk. They watch my steps. They have waited for my life. David's enemies desire devastation for him. These enemies plot his demise. This situation is a living nightmare. It is a living nightmare. And to quote some middle schoolers from a few years ago, this is the worst. Well, what is David's crisis? What is David's crisis? Well, first, you might be wondering, who is David, Pastor Terrence, who are you talking about? Who is he, and why is he so important? Well, he is the author of this psalm, as you see at the very beginning. David is the son of Jesse. The youth who killed the Philistine giant, Goliath, is David. He killed this giant when the giant threatened the people of Israel, when the king was too afraid to confront him. David is the man called by God to become the next king of Israel. The prophet of God named Samuel was sent by God out to Jesse's house to anoint not the oldest, but the youngest son, David, to be king. There's a great problem here, you all. There's a great problem here. Israel already has a king. His name is Saul. God also appointed Saul years before as ruler of Israel. And Saul knows that David is God's next chosen king. He hears it in the cheerings of the people. Saul has struck down his thousands, but David, his ten thousands. Saul's jealousy and his displeasure with David is venomous and deadly. Psalm 56 was written when David was fleeing from king Saul. And here he came before the Philistines in the city of Gath. Essentially, David was afraid. David was still a young man. He's afraid of Akish, the king of Gath. And so David fakes as if he is insane when he's brought before the king. As a result of David's faking madness, Akish rejected him from coming into his house. From Gath, David continues to escape the murderous intentions of king Saul. David is on the run and his life is in chaos. Here is a man who, having received a divinely given new appointment in life, desperately wonders about seeking to preserve his life from the current king. The current king whose singular intention is to end David's life and thus preserve his own kingdom. Understand this about Psalm 56. The will of God has been spoken and yet David is on the run. Let me say it another way. David has said, you're going to be king. And yet right now, David is running from town to town, city to city, hiding in caves, trying to stay alive. His life is in chaos. Can you identify? Can you identify? Do you know what it feels like to have enemies, for life not to go the way you want and need? Can you relate to feeling as if the Lord is not for you because of the desperation of your circumstances? Lord, are you there? Do you even care? God, are you listening? Will you help me? What is David's response? Well, getting to David's response, we move to the second thing I want us to see in this Psalm today. Number two, through grace, we can respond to crisis in faith. Through grace, we can respond to crisis in faith. And there are four responses that I see here. Number one, by grace, cry out to God in your situation. By grace. When I was in college, the campus ministry, I was a part of campus outreach. We had what we called investigative Bible studies with guys on the hall or girls on the hall. We were trying to win them to Jesus. And I remember having a conversation with a young fellow one day, and we were talking about grace. And I said to him, we live in God's ocean of grace. He wrote a very nice poem about it. The believer in God, in Jesus, we're getting to Jesus, lives in God's ocean of grace. And by grace, which we do not earn, which God gives, in grace, we can cry out to God in our situation and be honest with the Lord. Psalm 56, as our brother Ryan said, is a song. And it's also a prayer. David cries out to God in his desperation, be gracious to me, O God. Be gracious to me, O God. God, God, I need you. I need your help. I need your grace. Man tramples on me. My enemies trample on me all day long. Imagine him in a cave crying out to God, I need you. He tells God all about his situation. He doesn't leave anything out. He places his fear, his worry, his concern, his fatigue, his pain, his exasperation before the Lord God of Israel. In prayer, he prays to God, which leads to the second thing I want you to see here in responding to crisis in faith. By grace, have faith in God. By grace, have faith in God. By grace, trust God. Look at verses three and four. When I am afraid, when life's not going the way I want it to go, when my circumstances seem to crush the very life out of me and my hope, I put my trust in you. In God, whose word I praise, in God I trust, I shall not be afraid. What can flesh do to me? He repeats the same thing in verses 10 and 11. Look at them there, 10 and 11. In God, whose word I praise, in the Lord, whose word I praise, in God I trust, I shall not be afraid. What can man do to me? It reminds me of Paul's letter to the Romans, chapter 8, the last few verses. King James says, for I am persuaded that neither death nor life, it goes on all these different things that can be against you. He says, shall separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus, our Lord. David believes that God will help him, that God is intimately acquainted with his situation. You see that in verse 8. God, you've kept count of my tossings, of my wonderings. That's also what it means, of my wonderings. He says, put my tears in your bottle. I'm written in your book. David believes that the Lord God Almighty knows he's afraid. God knows Saul wants to kill him. The Lord knows that David has been running from place to place, trying to stay alive. There was a time, y'all, when the men of Israel were fighting against the Philistines, their enemies, and the Philistine champion, Goliath, could not be beaten. His sheer size brought tremendous terror and fear over even King Saul. I want you to hear what David said when he was about to face Goliath. He says this to Saul and his brothers and the other army, the members of the army of Israel. You got to remember, he's young. He's a youth. He's young. He's young. The Lord who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine. His job was guarding sheep. Sheep. Stinking, dirty, stupid sheep. And the bear came, and God protected him from the bear. And the lion came, and God delivered him from the lion. David stands in faith. This is a confession of faith. Trust. Confidence, if you will, in the Lord God Almighty. Though he is on the run, David trusts that the Lord will see him through this chaos and bring him safely to the other side. How? How does he have such faith? The third thing I want you to see here under responding to crisis in faith. By grace, remember and recite God's word. By grace, remember and recite God's word, God's promises. Verse four, I praise God's word. In God whose word I praise. In the Lord whose word I praise. You see the repetition, it's over and over and over again. Why? The word of God can be trusted. The word of God contains promises for those who believe in the Lord. God's word is intended to keep, to maintain, to sustain, to encourage, to heal, to motivate, and to guide God's people. David says, I know that God is for me. David, like all other Israelites, heard the word of God, the book of the covenant, on a regular basis. The word of God was always a part of the life of the Lord's people. David is a believer in the covenant Lord, who is the triune God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. David's like us, a disciple of God Almighty, if you will. David knew God's word in Deuteronomy chapter eight. I want to rehearse just a few verses, starting in verse one. And here you got to know that they heard this all the time. The whole commandment that I command you today, you should be careful to do, that you may live and multiply and go in and possess the land that the Lord swore to give to your fathers. You shall remember the whole way that the Lord your God has led you these 40 years in the wilderness, and they were in the wilderness because of disobedience. Remember that, because they didn't obey the word. That he might humble you, testing you to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments or not. And here I want you to hear this one very closely. And he, God, humbled you and let you hunger and fed you with manna, which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, that God might make you know that man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord. It's why I'm standing up here this morning. Amen. It's why Pastor Ryan is here from Sunday to Sunday preaching. We need the word of the Lord to live. Your clothing did not wear out on you. Your foot didn't swell these 40 years. Know then in your heart that as a man disciplines his son, the Lord your God disciplines you. So you shall keep the commandments of the Lord your God by walking in his ways and by fearing him. In Matthew chapter four, Jesus Christ, the word of God, the second person of the Trinity, the son of God who became a man out in the wilderness. He's being tempted by the devil. And he quotes the same passage to the devil, to Satan, to the adversary. Remember and recite Psalm 50 verse 15. I love this verse. Call on me in the day of trouble and I will deliver you and you shall glorify me. By grace, remember and recite the word and promises, promises of God in your life situations. The fourth response, by grace, actively walk with the Lord. By grace, actively walk with the Lord. The Holy Spirit teaches us today through Psalm 56 to walk with the Lord by demonstrating faith, by trusting God's word. Look at verse eight. God, you've taken account of my wonderings. He knows God is with him. Put my tears in your bottle. Are they not in your book? God, I'm calling on you because my life, my travels, my tears, my pain, my anxiety, you have known very well. My life is in your book, Lord. I'm placing my heart, my thoughts, my needs, my everything before you day after day after day. And I'm waiting on you, trusting you to answer because you know me. God, in you, I put my trust. Church, pray this every day. If you can't think of anything else to pray, pray this every day. In God, I've put my trust. I shall not be afraid. And say, Holy Spirit, do it. To actively walk with the Lord in faith means we have to make time to spend in God's word, the Holy Scriptures. Now, the DC life doesn't let you do that, does it? I'm busy. I don't have time for that until your life falls apart. Are you able to say, Psalm 23, the Lord is my shepherd? Are you able to say, Psalm 46, as we heard earlier, God is our refuge and strength. God is my refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. My mother says about the Old Testament, and the Old Testament is where you get your strength, meaning the Old Testament believers teach us by their faithfulness and their failings, how to trust God in the hardest times of life. It's not easy, lest you say, preacher, it's not easy all the time. How dare you tell us to do this? It's not easy to cry out to God, to trust God's promises, to actively walk with God when life is hard, and I'm in my feelings, and I don't want to listen. And yet David says in verse 12, he's preaching to himself, I must perform my vows to you, O God. By grace, I will walk with the Lord. Church, this is not easy. It's not easy. There are times when it seems we just cannot or do not want to call out to God in faith. And get this, God has got you covered. Let me just say it like that. God has got you covered. What you talking about, Terrence? Second Timothy chapter two, verse 13, the apostle Paul tells the timid Timothy this, if we are faithless, he, God, remains faithful, for God cannot deny himself. Hallelujah. God never lets go of his children. Psalm 56 teaches us one more lesson today. Number three, and the last, the last of the overall outline of this sermon, the Lord's provision is deliverance. The Lord's provision is deliverance. Look at verse 13, the Lord delivers. Listen to David's confession about the Lord God. For you have delivered my soul from death. Yes, my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of life. The Lord saved David from Saul. Saul did not succeed in killing David. Rather, Saul at the end took his own life. And David became king of Israel. God kept his word to David. God made him king. This psalm, this song teaches us to come honestly to God in prayer. And it teaches us that God is our answer. It teaches us that God is our answer, that God is our deliverer, that God is our ultimate rescuer. David is a witness to the delivering power of Almighty God. Psalm 46, through the power of the Holy Spirit, who is God, compels us to trust God to be our greatest good and our greatest answer to all of life's problems and circumstances. When my life is in chaos, God is the answer. When your life is in chaos, God is the answer. Jesus Christ, the Lord, is our deliverance, y'all. This world has problems. You want to know why? Because we got problems. We are what is wrong with the world. The Scriptures teach that we are what is wrong with the world. People are born into this world with dispositions that are in rebellion to God's design for what is good and right and true and just. And you see it every single day. We are sinners. We fail to miss the mark of God's standard. We are lawbreakers. We are covenant breakers. And we need a Savior. And God has given us a Savior, and his name is Jesus Christ. Listen to what the Apostle John says, "'For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him, the Son, Jesus, should not perish but have eternal life.'" Hear what the book of Hebrews chapter 12 has to say about Jesus, our deliverance. "'Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses,' and he's referencing chapter 11, what they call the hall of faith, "'let us lay aside every weight and sin which clings so closely. Let us run with endurance the race that is set before us.'" This gets me energized. I love this passage. Looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith. Jesus is the founder and the perfecter of our faith. Amen. "'Who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross.'" He had some enemies, us. "'He endured the cross, despising the shame, and is right now seated at the right hand of the throne of God.'" Listen to this. "'Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or faint-hearted in your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.'" Jesus did what David couldn't do. Jesus, God delivered David, but Jesus does even more. He endures hatred, persecution of his enemies, us, in order to bring us back into right relationship with God Almighty. In all of life, in any crisis, in any and every situation, Jesus is our Savior and our deliverance. Church, in crisis, you can trust and depend on God, his promises through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Let me say this. Church, God wants, he always wants us to trust and depend on him. Would you bow with me in a word of prayer? Life is filled with swift transition. None on earth unmoved can stand. Build your hope on things eternal. Hold to God's unchanging hand. Heavenly Father, you truly know us, the good, the bad, and the ugly. You know our failures and our faithlessness. You know when we are overwhelmed with the situations of life that we encounter. You know when we forsake your word and go our own way. Father, by your Spirit, increase our faith in you through Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. Teach us to prize your word and to trust you now and always as we journey through this world that we might share the good news of Jesus with others. This we pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
