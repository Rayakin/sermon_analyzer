Good morning once again. Good morning to our folks at our Reston campus tuning in today. Good to have you with us as well. We are working our way through our church mission statement, which you can find on the front of your order of service. We've talked about the fundamental purpose of human life and therefore the fundamental purpose of our church, which is to glorify and enjoy God. We've talked about how we do that primarily by making disciples who make a difference in the world. In the last week, we talked about living that out together through grace-filled worship. This week, we are looking at the topic of grace-filled community. Each week, we're opening up to a different passage to understand the biblical basis for why we think these things are so important for our life together. As we tackle this topic this morning, let me pray for our time in God's word. Father, we pray that the words of my mouth, the meditation of all of our hearts, would be pleasing unto you, our God, our rock, and our redeemer. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. I'm sure many of you read with excitement and relief that the COVID endemic has been officially declared not a public health emergency. That same week, actually just the week before, however, the U.S. Surgeon General announced a new public health emergency. You may have seen that headline, loneliness. It has been labeled such in other places, but it's now officially a public health emergency here. That might sound odd. It might not sound like such a big deal to you, but research continues to show that there are serious negative effects to social isolation. Research has shown that those who are socially isolated, those who are alone, are at increased risk for heart disease, 30% more likely. 30% more likely to have a stroke. Research has shown that those who are socially isolated and lonely can have their lifespan shortened by up to 15 years, which is the equivalent of the impact of smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Now, at the same time, you may have also seen earlier this year a study that was put out by the National Chamber of Commerce that tried to sort out the loneliest cities in America. Number one on the list, Washington, D.C. Number two on the list, the city I just moved from, St. Louis, Missouri. Number three on the list, Alexandria, Virginia. The DMV were number one and number three. Obviously not something you'd want to brag about, but certainly something you understand and maybe even experience. In some ways, these statistics are just telling us what we already know. We already know building meaningful community is hard. It's hard. And that loneliness hurts. We learned that a long time ago. First time you went away to sleepaway camp, you figured that one out. Loneliness hurts. Maybe the first time you went to college, maybe a long deployment taught you that, a long business trip, maybe just separation from friends and family and moving to this area. We all know that familiar ache of loneliness. And what's even more frustrating to us, I think, and baffling to us, is that we can even be in a room like this, surrounded by mostly friendly people. I think most of you are friendly people, I think, looking at you. You're sitting close together, so you kind of like each other. You can be in a room like this and still feel utterly alone, unseen, unknown. Like you're just going to walk out of here and you're just going to assume no one really cares that you were here at all. And there's nothing to be ashamed of. All of us have felt that way. Loneliness is just part of the human experience. And in some ways, that's what makes this passage such a fascinating case study in community. There are lots of places we could go in the Bible to talk about community, but we chose this one partly because it shouldn't be here, humanly speaking. Like much of the New Testament, when we open up to the book of Philippians, we are reading someone else's mail. Legally, but we are reading a letter from the Apostle Paul to the church in Philippi, hence the word Philippians. And the Apostle Paul is in prison when he's writing this letter, probably in Rome, awaiting trial. And he's writing to the Philippians 800 miles away. And so here, in the middle of that letter, you have this beautiful portrait of deep, meaningful, life-transforming relationships written by someone who was utterly cut off from meaningful community. He has human contact with his guards. We learn that in chapter 1. And also with his two faithful men, Timothy and Epaphroditus. Timothy was Paul's protege. He was a pastor in training that Paul brought along and was here with him in Rome, at least for a time. And Epaphroditus was a man the Philippians had sent from their congregation to visit Paul with a financial gift. And in the process, they struck up quite the relationship, and Epaphroditus becomes a very close friend. But other than that, Paul is alone. And yet, when he talks about friendship, relationship, he's talking about the sort of community many of us long for. So how does this happen? Well, Paul drops a hint right away in verse 19 when he tells us, when he tells the Philippians, I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon. Now, if you've ever done, like, archival research into letters, you see, kids, back in the day, people used to write letters to each other, and they saved everything. And when you do that, you think you're going to run across this treasure trove of historical information. What you mostly find is logistics, because that's how people sorted out logistics back in the day. They wrote letters. I will see you henceforth in, you know, two fortnights or whatever. They're making plans to meet up with each other. Paul is just talking about logistics. I'm going to send Timothy to you soon, hopefully. But he doesn't just say, I hope to do that. He says, I hope in the Lord Jesus. As if to signal right away that Jesus isn't just interested in the spiritual stuff over here. He is right in the middle of our community life, orchestrating, building community for our good. And so with that little hint, we're going to talk about two things this morning, the way Jesus builds community in two ways, by connecting us in community and by freeing us for community, by connecting us in community, by freeing us for community. First of all, Jesus connects us in community. And I want to talk about this in two ways as well, because there are two relationships I want to make sure we have in mind. The first is our relationship with God, that Jesus connects us in community with God himself. And on the basis of that connection, connects us with each other. Now, Paul doesn't go into all of this about how Jesus connects us to God, but we really need to start there, because our topic this morning is not, you know, how to make friends and influence people. This is not just how to have people in your life so you're less lonely and have something to do on Saturday night. This is not how to recruit people onto your kickball team, or your hip hop crew, or whatever it is that you do socially. This is fundamentally about a reality that takes place when Jesus gets a hold of your life. Reality number one, he connects you to God. Which means, straight away, we have to sort this out. Loneliness is not just a social problem that can get fixed by increasing our social circles. Loneliness, as the Bible understands it, is also a spiritual problem. It's a way of understanding our fundamental problem as human beings, that we have been, as Paul says in Colossians 1, alienated from God by our sin. This is the story that the Bible tells us about ourselves, that we were made to have fellowship with God, but we bailed. We decided we wanted to live by ourselves, for ourselves, and so we sabotaged our relationship with God in order to pursue our own proud, sinful way. There is a relationship problem that has to be dealt with by every single one of us. I've always found it incredibly moving that the English writer Julian Barnes, who is an agnostic, began his memoir with these words. I don't believe in God, but I miss him. Some of you really can't relate to those words at all. Some of you know exactly what he's talking about. Because when Paul says in Colossians 1, in another letter, that we are alienated from God, you have a felt sense of that distance, what Francis Schaeffer has called cosmic loneliness, that ache. What we all need to remember, whether you really resonate with that felt sense of alienation or not, what all of us need to be reminded of is how Paul completes that thought in Colossians 1. He says, yes, in our sin, we have alienated ourselves from God. We have cut the tether between us and God, and we are floating into the void of meaninglessness, and yet Jesus, in his grace, has reconciled us to God. That's the word Paul uses. How? By his death. Why? So that he might present us holy and blameless in his sight. You see, that's the gospel. That's the good news, that Jesus came fundamentally to reconcile us to God, to repair the very relationship we ruined with our sin. So the first question of grace-filled community you need to answer is, have you been reconciled to God? You can't do that yourself, but Jesus can do that for you. And when Jesus reconciles you to God, you need to begin to grapple with a second reality, that when he connects us to God, he connects us to each other. It's a package deal. All right, you know they say when you marry the one, you marry what? The family. Welcome to the family. When God adopts us into his family, he adopts us into his family. You just inherited a global network of brothers and sisters in Christ. It's not like, oh, it's okay, I don't want that option on the menu. It's yours. You have it. You belong to Christ, and when you belong to Christ, you belong to everyone else he has purchased with his precious blood. That's why Paul uses the language of brother and sister in his letters. That's why he says here when he talks about Timothy in verse 22, Timothy has proven his worth, how as a son with his father. That's not unusual for Paul. He talks like this all the time. Timothy is not his literal son. He is his spiritual son. Paul is his spiritual father to Timothy. The same thing with Epaphroditus. It's actually just quicker to say my brother than Epaphroditus, but that's not why Paul's doing it. It's because Paul really understands him to be my brother. It's not a term of endearment. It's not a nickname. It's not like, hey, bro. It's not that. This is Paul stating a spiritual reality, which is true of every Christian in every place, in every culture, speaking every language across the globe right now. We are related in Christ. You can start calling each other brother and sister if you want. That's up to you. The Apostle John refers to his congregation in 1 John as my little children. So just like heads up, that's how I'm going to be speaking to you for a while, just like my little children. I like that. So week in and week out. You can use the language if you want. It doesn't really matter to me. What matters most to God is that we actually treat each other like family. That's not optional. So that when Paul says in Ephesians chapter 4 that we should be eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit and the peace of Christ, therefore, we should be humble with each other, bear with one another patiently, love one another, give each other the benefit of the doubt, keep a short list of accounts, and on and on and on. What he's saying is this is how family treats one another. On the basis of your connection together, because of your connection to the Heavenly Father, it changes the way you act with each other. Now look, I know not all of us grew up with the best family dynamics. I get that. And I get that the church hasn't always operated with the best family dynamics. I get that. But this is the bar that our Heavenly Father sets for us. And here's the question. What happens when that connection gets threatened? You know, wasn't that long ago that the tensile strength of our bond in Christ was under a fair bit of pressure, wouldn't you say? I don't know. It tends to happen every four years. I'm not sure why. It just does. Maybe not here, but I'll just talk about other places. This tends to happen, you know? And the reason it tends to happen is we tend to begin to operate more out of our commonality, whether it's our political affiliation or ideological view or whatever it is that's important to us. And these things are important to us, and they should be. But it's when the differences between us arise that our bond in Christ gets tested. So here's my challenge for you. Capital Prez, family. When differences arise, and they will, I can promise you they will, what's going to win out? Is it our bond in Christ, or is it all the other competing commonalities and bonds and fabric that we've woven into our lives? I was talking to another pastor just this week. In his congregation, two men who are part of opposing political campaigns, not just different sides of the aisle, that happens all the time, but literally like Monday through Saturday, duking it out. And they finally had to have a cup of coffee and say, how are we going to do this? Because we're brothers in Christ. That's the challenge, not just in the political world, but also in all the other things that we hold dearly and we should. To have Christ in common does not mean to have everything in common. To be unified in Christ is not to be conformed to one way of thinking about the world. That's never going to happen, nor should it. It's not good for us. But when disagreements happen, what does God our Father say? You need to treat each other like family. So there's this connection in Christ, and we recognize that that's not easy. So we also need to talk about how Jesus frees us for community. Not just connecting us in community, but freeing us for community. There's a little hyphenated word, grace-filled, in the mission statement that's purposeful. It's modifying three words. It's doing the work of modifying worship, community, and mission. So what is grace-filled community? Well, what we mean by that is partly what we've already said, that our expectation is that we would treat one another with grace. But we also recognize this in many ways is what distinguishes this gathered community from every other community that you're part of. Because every other community that you're part of, you're part of that community because of what you like, or what you do, or what you contribute, or how you perform, or what you prefer. But this community, the basis of this community is not what you do. The basis of this community and every other gathered church around the world today is what Jesus has done for us. So I love the word grace-filled because it gives us a high bar in how we relate to each other. I also really love the word grace-formed because in order to be grace-filled in your relationships, you have to be grace-formed. You have to be formed by the grace of God as it is displayed and magnified in the person and work of Jesus. That's not being formed by the idea of grace, like, yeah, let's just kind of be cool to each other. That would be cool. It's not what we're talking about. It's not what Paul's talking about. Everything he says here about being a grace-filled community is predicated on what he said in the beginning of this chapter, verses 1 through 11. One of the great theological statements about how Jesus set aside all the rights and privileges of God, even though he is equal with God, in order to humble himself to become like us and live a life of perfect obedience to the Father and go to the cross and pay for our debts and rise again that we might rise with him. All of that is right there in the first 11 verses, not as a systematic theology lesson, but as a systematic community lesson. Because right away in verse 1, Paul is saying, you want to know what it looks like to be a grace-filled community? You have to get this first, that Jesus put you all together like this out of his grace. Not because you deserved it, not because you got your act together, but out of his grace he has done this sacrificial work for us. This has a number of effects on our community life together. First of all, it frees us to be vulnerable. Paul goes on to say in chapter 3, so if you scoot ahead to chapter 3, you'll notice that there's a place at which Paul gives his resume. He's interacting with some people who are infiltrating the church in Philippi, who are pulling out their spiritual resumes every chance they get to show how spiritual and righteous they are. And Paul says, look, if you want to play that game, I can play that game all day. I've got all the religious cred in the world. He goes, but that's nothing because my righteousness, my sense of worth and significance, my worth before the face of a holy God is not the righteousness that I've done, it's the righteousness of Christ. This is how he puts it in Philippians 3, verse 9. It's not the righteousness of my own that comes from obeying God's law. That's not the basis of my relationship with God. No, the basis of my relationship with God is the righteousness which comes through faith in Christ. Now, we could talk about that for a very long time, but let me just bring it down to this very practical outworking in our lives. This means that you are liberated from having to prove yourself. You are freed from having to pretend that you have it all together. You don't have to pull out your resume every chance you get to let everybody, I know this would never happen in DC, but let's just pretend it happens here every once in a while. We're like, all right, I got to measure up, level up, and the gospel actually frees you to do something very different and very healthy. Instead of trying to keep up and measure up and level up, you can just own up. You could admit your faults, mistakes, sins even. You can admit that you actually need help. See, this is not the vision we have of Paul, the Apostle Paul striding through the Mediterranean, planting churches, taking beatings, preaching sermons, getting in the face of religious leaders, speaking before the great philosophers of the age. This is not the image of high-maintenance, vulnerable Paul, and yet when you get him talking about his friends, he says things like this. I have no one like Timothy, and I would let him come to you, but I need him, so you can't have him. Or to say about Epaphroditus, he is my fellow brother. He is my fellow soldier. He's ministered to me in my hour of need. Paul's not shy about receiving help. He's not shy about saying, if anything had happened to Epaphroditus, I'd be devastated. Sorrow upon sorrow. He's emotionally vulnerable. Why? Because he's been liberated by the gospel. To be vulnerable and also to be authentic, I want you to think of it this way. Jesus has paid the highest compliment to you that he could ever pay, that anyone could ever pay, that you belong to him, that you were worth his life. Yet so many of us are just scrambling for affirmation and fishing for compliments, hoping that someone notices when in fact in the gospel we have all the affirmation and all the acceptance and all the worth our hearts could ever need. The gospel liberates us to say things like this. For Paul to be able to look at Epaphroditus and say, you should receive him with honor because he has done well. It's not flattery. It's not manipulation. There's no qualification. You know those backhanded compliments? It's not that. It's simply Paul looking at this man and saying, God has made you well. Can I just tell you that the power of being an encouraging word to people, to being freed up to be able to look at somebody not with envy or a competitive edge and say, what you've done is good. Who you are is important. Paul is free to be authentic in that way. He also recognizes how the gospel frees us to be tenacious. The word tenacious means determined, dogged, in pursuit. We see in this, Paul was certainly that way, but Epaphroditus was also a tenacious guy. He'd been sent by the Philippian church over 800 miles with a bag full of money to deliver it to Paul. In the process of doing that, in the process of staying in Rome with Paul, he got so sick. Paul tells us that he nearly died. He risked his life for Paul. You could say, well, he certainly loved Paul, which he did. He certainly had a sense of duty, which he did, but you also have to think that Epaphroditus recognized the way that Jesus not just risked his life, but gave his life. He looked at our needs, Jesus did, and he put them first. That's what the first few verses of chapter 2 tell us. He put our needs before his own. Jesus did that for you, and then calls us to do the same for one another. Those three words may sound familiar to you, tenacious, vulnerable, authentic. That's because that's the kind of community we talk about wanting to foster and cultivate, especially in our community groups. Sometimes we just call them CGs for short. But community groups, we have about 70 community groups in our church, about 800 people. That's about over 50% of our church are involved in these small groups that meet throughout the DMV a couple times a month or once a week. It's not the only way for you to be known and for you to begin to build community, but it's a really effective and good way. Because this is a big church. Folks at Reston, maybe not this many people, but just as easy at a church there as it is here for you just to kind of slip in and slip out on Sunday. I talk to a lot of new people, maybe you're new to the church, and they'll say things like, man, people here are so friendly, but I never sit next to the same person twice. I got to know this person, and then I never see them again for three months. It's not because people aren't here, it's because they're at a different service or sitting in a different part or whatever. Community groups are a way to fight against our drift into isolation. Do you know that about yourself? Okay, pastor confessing in front of the congregation time. I know this about myself. The current of my heart is not toward community. If I stop paddling, what happens? I drift into isolation. I can say this on authority because I'm a man. It is statistically verifiable that men drift into isolation, drift into being guarded, drift into addiction, drift into loneliness. That's where our hearts go. It's not just true about men, it's true about women, but men are...we're really good at drifting into isolation. Last week, we attended my oldest son's college graduation. It was a wonderful time, and we got to celebrate. He made it, all that stuff. One of the great joys, and if you're a parent, a grandparent, or just a sibling or something, you've seen this. One of the great joys of that experience is all of a sudden being in the inner circle. You've heard about all these people that your kid hangs out with, and then you're there. These people are really weird. No, that's not it. It's like, really? Four years with these folks? No, but you just sit back and you watch community. I'm really glad he has a degree. That's really a wise investment for all of us. I'm even happier that he has friends. As a parent, that's what you want. From the time your kid goes to kindergarten, like, who's your friend? Who do you have? Even into adulthood, parents worry about that. Like, who are my kids' people? Don't think your Heavenly Father thinks any differently about you. It's more so. He wants that for you. Who doesn't want that for the children they love? He wants that for you. So much so that he gave us Jesus to connect us in community with himself and package deal with each other so that we might grow, cultivate a community that is marked and distinguished and different because of his grace toward us. It's a delight to do that together, to figure that out together, to build that together. Let me pray for us as we do. Father, I thank you for this word that you give us and thank you for the gift of the church that you give to us. We pray, Lord, that we might live in such a way that we exhibit the unity of the spirit, that we might demonstrate that there, in fact, is one body, one spirit, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of us all so that we may all be of one heart and one soul and glorify and enjoy you. We pray in Christ's name, God's people said together, amen.
