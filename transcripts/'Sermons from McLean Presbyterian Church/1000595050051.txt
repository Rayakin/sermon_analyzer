Good morning. It is good to be here with you all. Well, I wanna start off just by saying thank you. Thank you for your partnership in the gospel and prayer and giving. RUF is the denomination's official campus ministry and we don't go to campus alone. We go to campus sent by the church, sent by the church's prayers and sent by the church's generosity. So McLean is a partner with us as a church and many of you have partnered with me as individuals and families. And so I just want to say thank you. As Pastor Ryan has said, we are in Mark and we are in chapter nine, starting at verse 30. So Mark is a gospel account, meaning it is a telling of the life, death and resurrection of Jesus. And in this section, Jesus is showing us what it means to have our lives shaped by the cross. What it means to embrace a mission shaped by the cross. So in our time this morning, we will see that Christ invites us to be great by becoming small. That's it, that's the whole message. Christ invites us to be great by becoming small. So again, turn with me to Mark chapter nine at verse 30. I'll read, excuse me, I'll pray for us and then I'll dive in. Lord, we thank you for the opportunity to know you. To sing your praises. Lord, there's literally no one greater than you. There's no one in your category. There's no one in your league. God, your glory is weighty. And Lord, I pray that we would see that this morning. We have already seen it through the prayers, through praises, through confession, through greeting one another, through serving one another. And Lord, I pray that now you would come and meet us as your word is preached. Lord, you know, and I know that I'm made of dust. You know my frame. And so Lord, I pray that you would send your spirit to fill me. That Lord, you would have your way in and through me this morning. God, I really do need you. Lord, I need you every day, every hour, every second. So Lord, I pray you would give me love, humility, boldness, clarity, conviction, a clear conscience that I might declare your word. Lord, I pray that you would make it plain through me. And Lord, I pray that you would open the hearts of your hearers, that they might be able to receive your word. Lord, I pray that they would give their ears to it and not only hear it, but love it, believe it, cherish it. Lord, I pray that they would leave here with your word planted inside of them and that it would bear fruit. Lord, I pray that they wouldn't just be good hearers of your word, they would be good doers of your word. So Lord, refresh us, comfort us, build us up, do the things that only you can do this morning. Lord, we love you, amen. So I was recently interviewing Professor K.A. Ellis in a podcast interview. She's the director for the Edmiston Center for the Study of the Bible and Ethnicity at RTS Atlanta. And she studies theological ethics and world Christianity. And she works really closely with stealth Christianity and Christians who are following Jesus on the margins. And she was telling me about a powerful opportunity she had in serving Christians on the margins. She was honored to facilitate a handwritten letter from a group of pastors in a closed country to another church thousands of miles away. And it was a letter of encouragement and it was across a language barrier. And so she was exulting in this opportunity and reflecting on this opportunity, she said this, I'm just the middle man standing in the middle of all these people doing really amazing things. She says this, all I have to do is just stand here and be small. Isn't that powerful? Isn't that a great way of viewing all of ministry, all of life, really? If I could just stand here and be small, Lord, and you'd be great. But don't we oftentimes want the opposite? Don't we oftentimes tell the Lord, we don't explicitly say this, but we feel this, Lord, I will only stand here if I can be great, if I could be seen, if I could be known, if I can associate myself with the greatest in serving. And if that's not true, then we are actually reluctant and may refuse to serve God. And that's exactly the mentality that the disciples embraced in this passage. But Jesus corrected them and he shows them a different way of being great. He showed them a different way of being great. So like I said, our main point for our time today is Christ invites you to be great by being small. Christ invites you to be great by being small. And I wanna look at four different ways that we become small. I wanna look at the lifestyle of those who are small. So first, Christ invites us to be great by embracing the small. Christ invites us to be great by embracing the small. And we see this in verses 33 through 37. So our passage is actually a part of a larger section that begins in Mark 8.22 and ends in Mark 10.52, where Jesus kind of gives his disciples three rounds of teaching on his suffering, death, and resurrection. And so in our passage, the disciples, they are traveling through Galilee and Jesus is teaching them for the second time about his own suffering, death, and resurrection. And of course, the disciples are confused because in their conception of a king, a king doesn't die. And then what, rise again? And so as they're traveling, he noticed that they were having arguments and divisions amongst themselves. There was drama amongst Jesus' disciples. So when they got to their destination and Jesus asked them what they were arguing about. And it's funny because the disciples were silent. Jesus asked them a question and they were silent. Either, I'm assuming because they were too embarrassed to tell the truth or maybe they were fearful. But Jesus knew exactly what they were arguing about because in verses 33 through 34, the scriptures tell us that the disciples were arguing about who was the greatest. And Jesus knew this. They were arguing about who was the greatest, even while Jesus was teaching them about suffering and death. Now, I don't have a good idea of what their measurement system was in order to figure out who was the greatest, right? Like, what does that even look like among Jesus' traveling company and their argument? You know, hey, I've done more healings than you. I'm definitely the greatest. Or yeah, I've spent more time with Jesus this last week. I'm definitely the greatest. I'm definitely the one at the center of this group. Or yeah, man, the exorcism I did last week, impeccable, I'm the greatest. I don't know what that conversation looks like, but they were obsessed with their own status and their own exaltation and glory in comparison to others. And so Jesus sits down in the middle of the house to reinforce what he was teaching them while they were traveling. And he says this, he begins by saying, if anyone would be first, he must be last of all and servant of all. Did y'all catch that? The way to become great is to become small. And the greatest leader among them was the greatest servant among them. See, Jesus totally revamped their measuring system about what it meant to be great. And he does this with a live illustration. You know what Jesus does in good Jesus-like fashion? He sits down in the middle of the room with his disciples. And I imagine that maybe the disciples' children were in the room and he calls a child to him and literally embraces a child in his arms. And he says this, to receive this child in my name is to receive me and to receive me is to receive the one who sent me. This is powerful, y'all. The apostles, just like Jesus was literally doing, were to embrace the small. And so like the parables, this is meant to impact us. We're not meant to like totally dissect this, but let's notice just a few things about this. Why a child? You see, people saw children probably a little bit different than we see them nowadays. Children were the most humble and unimportant and lowly in society at that time. Jesus embracing a child here would have actually been a little scandalous. They would have been like, what is Jesus doing bringing one of the children into his lap while we're sitting here learning as apostles? And what does it mean to receive someone in Jesus' name? To do something in the name of someone means to represent them. Jesus is saying, in order to understand me, you must understand that I can use the most unimportant, small and lowly of society to be my representative. Jesus embraced the smallest as worthy of association with the greatest. And Jesus shows us by embracing a child in his arms. And not only that, but we must notice the language formula that Jesus uses here. So Matthew tells us in chapter 10, verse 40, that when he sends out the apostles for ministry, Jesus told them, whoever receives you receives me and whoever receives me receives him who sent me. You see the same language that Jesus used to commission the apostles is the same language that he's using here with this little child. Jesus is artfully challenging the apostles' conception about what it even means to be an apostle. To be an apostle, you must embrace the persona of a little child, to be small, unimportant and lowly. To be an apostle is to be a childlike representative of Jesus. But the disciples were exactly the kind of people who would have not embraced the small because they would have actually seen Jesus as too important to receive a child. And how do I know this? Because Mark, I think actually has a sense of humor and maybe he doesn't have one, maybe the disciples are just funny on their own. But in chapter 10, verse 13, basically the disciples, they rebuke people for trying to bring people, I mean, bring children to Jesus. People are trying to bring the children to Jesus and disciples are trying to shoo them away and Jesus rebukes them. We see that the disciples fundamentally do not yet understand their Lord. Family, this passage ought to shape the mission of the church. As a church, we must ask the question in our community, in our city, what does it look like for us to serve Jesus as those who embrace the small? What does this look like for us? What does it look like for our church to embrace the persona of the lowest social order, to be small, unimportant, and lowly in our mission? And I think this is a particularly important question for those of us in the PCA, in our kind of church circles. We typically are those who are at the center of power, who are affluent, who are oftentimes silently middle income or having more access to wealth and power. And it is very tempting for us to forget that being a Christian is about being lowly, about being humble, about being those who are generous and self-sacrificial. I know it at least is for me. But next, Christ invites us to be great by uniting with the small. Christ invites us to be great by uniting with the small. And we see this in verse 38 through 42. So again, I think the disciples are just funny. After Jesus has told them this, John speaks up and he basically shares with Jesus that the disciples have done what Jesus just said not to do. He's basically says, hey, Jesus, we actually tried to stop someone from casting out demons because they weren't in our crew. I don't know why John says this. He must've wanted to get rebuked. But it makes sense that the apostles would do this because they were obsessed with being great. And watch this. When you're obsessed with being great, it brings about a competitive spirit. When you wanna be great, you don't wanna see others being great. And that's why they tried to stop this other disciple who wasn't in their crew from doing an exorcism. And this is comical again, because literally 20 verses earlier, Mark tells us about a situation where the disciples tried to cast out a demon while Jesus was away. And guess what? They failed. Here you have the great apostles who failed in contrast with this other random lowly disciple who was succeeding. And the apostles thought the only way that God will work is through us. And if not through us, then through no one. And Jesus here encourages the apostles to embrace a spirit of celebrating people who have united with Jesus in the apostles' cause, even if they aren't in the end circle of the apostles' traveling company. Jesus then tells them that he will reward the smallest act done in service of his name. Here what's really happening is that, and really when you look at this long passage, it all feels random because at first they're talking about children, and then they're talking about exorcisms, and then they're talking about millstones and cutting off your hands and your feet. And you're like, how does all this fit together? And I think what's happening here, is again, like I said, the apostles are bringing up a situation where they were trying to prevent a little one to serve Jesus. And here Christ gives them a warning about causing little ones to stumble. He says, it will be better for him if a great millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea. You see, a millstone was a big circular stone that was moved by donkeys to grind grain. And to have the stone wrapped around your neck and then thrown into the sea would have been a gruesome drowning with no hope of burial or rescue. What Jesus is saying here, he's saying something really hard. He's saying that his judgment belongs to those who refuse to unite with the small. His judgment belongs to those who refuse to unite with the small. And family, is it possible that maybe part of us could be like the disciples in our heart of hearts, and maybe not even only our heart of hearts, but outwardly? In what ways do we have a competitive spirit with other people, with other ministries, other churches that we see as lesser than? That even though they're serving Jesus and they're doing powerful work, we really wish they were shut down because they're really not in our crew or our denomination or in our community group or in our family or in our friend circle. In what ways are we refusing to unite with the small and celebrate with the small? And are we taking seriously Jesus' warning to those who hinder the kingdom ministry of his little ones? But thirdly, Christ invites us to be great by sacrificing for the small. He invites us to be great by sacrificing for the small. And we see this in verses 43 through 48. And so in the next several verses, Christ begins to talk about the things in the disciples' lives that prevent them from becoming small. He's basically saying that they must eradicate anything in their lives that caused them and to borrow Matthew's words, to despise one of these little ones. Even if it means becoming crippled, physically lame, or partially blind. And so though Jesus is using an exaggerated statement here, we shouldn't allow that to have his words miss us. We should feel the depth and the impact of what he's saying here. To be great according to Christ's standard requires deep, deep sacrifice. The kind of sacrifice that if I'm honest, if we're honest, many of us are reluctant to give. And so Christ, you know, three times he's giving the disciples two paths. He's basically, in Jesus-like fashion, he's giving them the path of life or the path of death. They can either sacrifice for the sake of the small and receive life in the kingdom of God, or they can refuse to sacrifice for the sake of the small and receive fiery judgment. Family, this is a hard word. This is not teddy bear Jesus. This is not security blanket Jesus. This is Jesus, King of Kings, Lord of Lords, who is gentle and he is lowly and he loves his little ones. He loves his weak ones. He loves those who are afflicted and lowly, and he will move to defend them and protect them. Mission requires sacrifice. We must ask ourselves, what are the things in my life that I refuse to sacrifice in order to associate with the small and to become small? It could be a way of thinking. It could be a friendship. It could be a certain possession or a certain job or a certain social club. What causes us to stumble in becoming small for the sake of Christ's mission? And lastly, Christ invites us to be great by giving it all. Christ invites us to be great by giving it all. And so again, like I said, this passage has a lot of weird sections. You know, like I said, we're starting off talking about children and arguing about who's the greatest. And then we talk about drowning and then we get to cutting off limbs. And now Jesus starts talking about fire and salt. It's like, what is going on here, Jesus? And we see this in verses 49 through 50. And this is actually hard to interpret. This verse is hard to translate. Jesus says this, for everyone will be salted with fire. Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its saltiness, how will you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves and be at peace with one another. So like I said, this is hard to interpret on multiple levels. One, at the level of Greek grammar, and at another level, the manuscript tradition, and then at the level of how this imagery of salt and fire even connects with what Jesus has been telling his disciples before this. But here's what I think is going on here. I've spent a lot of time staring at this verse. I believe that Christ is switching from one location in Jerusalem to another. Now, earlier in the passage, your passage, likely what your ESV translation or maybe another translation says is hell. The word hell comes up. But your Bible translates this as hell to help you out because we're in the Western hemisphere and we're connected to culture where hell is familiar. But really what this actually says is Gehenna. The word there is actually Gehenna. It's really a, Jesus is pulling from the Old Testament. It really is actually the Valley of the Sons of Himnon. And it kind of shortens into Gehenna, but it was a valley outside of Jerusalem. And in the Old Testament, it's associated with God's fiery destruction. Gehenna is associated with God's fiery destruction. So he starts out by saying, hey, if you do not sacrifice for the small, Gehenna is a danger for you. He starts out with a warning. But then what Jesus does is he travels out from outside of Jerusalem at Gehenna to the center of Jerusalem, to the temple altar. You see also in the Old Testament, when they would offer sacrifices up in fire, they would season the sacrifice for God. Did y'all know that? Isn't that interesting? They would season God's sacrifices with salt. Christ is basically saying there's two fires. There's no way that you escape the fire as a human being. You either face a fire that separates you from God or a fire that offers you up to God. A fire that brings down the great or a fire that lifts up the small to God. Just like salt was used to prepare sacrifices on the altar in the Old Testament era, the disciples are to embrace smallness in preparation to give their lives for Jesus as a pleasing aroma to God. And then in verse 50, he asked a rhetorical question, basically saying, he's basically saying this, how can seasoning season itself when it's lost its flavor, right? It's like, how can salt regain its saltiness when it's lost its saltiness? And the answer is it can't. Seasoning cannot season itself. He's basically saying, just like salt cannot be anything other than salt, salt is salt. The disciples cannot be anything other than small servants. A quote unquote, great disciple of Jesus is an oxymoron. It's a paradox. And so Christian, what do we do with this? We must adopt a mindset, all of us, whether you're officially a missionary or not, we must adopt a missionary mindset that thinks outwardly, that embraces smallness, that unites with smallness. A missionary mindset is one that is willing to embrace the small, unite with the small, sacrifice for the small, and to give it all. When we are tempted to only engage in the mission of God, when it means serving those we deem as great, when we're tempted to serve alongside those who you regard as first, when we're tempted to only serving when it is comfortable, only serving if it means we get to keep our lives as they now stand, in your own city and across the seas. Because this small mindset leads to peace within the church and a church that is at peace within itself can actually execute its mission as the church. And this is why the last thing that Christ tells the disciples in this passage, he says, be at peace with one another. Churches that embrace a spirit of greatness are actually divided churches. They're churches that are always at turmoil within themselves. They cannot accomplish anything for Christ, anything at least that will last. But a mission-minded church is a humble church and therefore a united church and therefore a powerful church. So I urge us to continue to find ways to be prayerful and active in service in our city, in our community and within our church. And particularly find ways to serve that aren't popular, that aren't flashy, that aren't grand, that won't put you in front of people. Find ways to serve that are behind the scenes. Find ways to serve where people may not thank you, that people may look over because it is good for our souls. It's good for our souls. This is why I'm so grateful that when I started out ministry I started out as a church planting apprentice at my home church. And I found out that ministry was much more than standing up front and preaching. As a pastor, I was a janitor for the church. I also did wiring for the church. We built stages. I actually found out you kind of have to be strong to do pastoral ministry because I was carrying cones and lifting plywood, right? You're helping people walk into the sanctuary. You're cleaning bathrooms, right? You're vacuuming. This, I'm so glad my ministry started out that way because this is what it means to be like Jesus. And so when I stand up before people, I do it as an act of love, as an act of service in the same category as cleaning the floors. At least at my best, that's what it is. But y'all, this word is hard, isn't it? Being small, isn't it hard to be small? Do any of us naturally want to be small? I'll confess, I naturally want to be great, right? When I daydream, I daydream about being great. I don't daydream about being small, right? This word is a hard word. It sounds scary and it sounds impossible. If you're thinking this, I'm with you. But I think it is beautiful that Christ in this area, he doesn't call us to do something that he hasn't first done himself. Christ knows what it is like to stand, serve God and be small. Christ, though equal with God the Father in power and glory became small by becoming a human. Christ, though the King of Kings and Lord of Lords became small by rejecting the royal city and ministering among the everyday folk, the peasants of Northern Palestine. Christ, though the creator of the whole world, he became small by pursuing in love a world that did not even recognize him as God. Christ, though the embodiment of cleanliness and purity became small by touching the diseased and the lepers in order to heal them. Christ, though righteous and just in every way became small by eating and partying with the morally scandalous of his day. Christ, though the King of the Jews became small by conversing with the despised Samaritans and the untouchable Gentiles. Christ, though the Lord of heaven's armies became small by allowing an armed mob to capture his body for you and I. Christ, though judge of all the earth, he became small by submitting to the unjust court proceedings of unjust judges. Christ, though clothed in the righteousness of God became small by allowing his enemies to dress him in a crown of thorns and robes of mockery. Christ, though the one worthy of all honor became small by allowing his enemies to shamefully hang him naked on a piece of wood. And Christ, though the giver of the highest of life became small by dying the lowest of deaths as a slave. Christ did all of this to serve you and I. He did this for us because he loves us. He did not hold anything back in loving us. Mark chapter 10, verse 45 says, for even the son of man came not to be served, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many. Isn't that powerful? If anybody came, had the right to come to be served, it was Jesus. But he came to serve. Our selfish obsessions with being great deserve the millstone of drowning in the eternal fires of judgment. But Christ himself drowned in the wrath of God and faced the fires of God's fury in your place so that you can have eternal life and an entrance into the kingdom of God. The great one became small so that us great ones might have the power to become small. Christ gives us his pardon and power so that we can actually embrace smallness in real life, in real time, not only in theory. You see, with man, this is impossible, but with God, nothing is impossible. We can only become small and give it all for Christ when we realize that Christ became small and has given it all for us. Family, Christ invites you to become great. He invites you to become great by embracing the small, great by uniting with the small, great by sacrificing for the small, and great by giving it all. Will you stand, serve, and be small? Amen? Would you all pray with me? Lord, we thank you for the fact that Jesus, you came not to be served, but to serve and give your life as a ransom for many. Jesus, I pray we can be like you. Jesus, you are so glorious and so beautiful. Lord, the honor of our life, the joy of our life, the goal of our life is to reflect you. And so, Lord, I pray that the power of your spirit would make that a reality in our lives. Lord, help us to be great by serving. Help us to be great by being the least. Help us to be great by being small. I pray that this just wouldn't be something that we spiritualize and that we say we're doing inside of our hearts, but it would overflow into our words. It would overflow into our actions. It would overflow into our relationships. It would overflow into our community service. It would overflow in the ways that we engage others in our church, in our community. Lord, I pray that this would bring about a beautiful, rich communion of the saints, as the Apostles' Creed says. Lord, I pray that we would not be at war with one another, but like you said, Jesus, we would be at peace with one another and be a church that is humble and therefore united and therefore powerful. Jesus, we thank you that though you are small, you are the exalted King. You have been given a name that is above every name so that every knee may bow in the heavens, in the earth, and under the earth. And Lord, as we bow, as we lean on your power, I pray that we would also walk in weakness to serve others. Lord, we love you. Amen.
