Good morning. My name is Ryan. It's good to be with you this morning. You already know we're looking at Genesis chapter one, so I'd encourage you to turn there. I mentioned last week that last week marked our two year anniversary of coming here for me to be the senior pastor, and I expressed then, I'll say it again if you weren't here, what a joy it is to be, have the privilege of being your senior pastor and opening God's word with you. Most Sundays, including this Sunday, we probably know each other well enough for me to share this with you at this point. In our family, we have a rather impassioned debate over which of the nine Star Wars movies is the best. Based on the fact that I grew up with the originals, I know what the right answer is, which is that episodes four through six are the best, but I have kids who grew up with the prequels, and so they should know better, but they think that the first three episodes are the best. Interestingly, the latest movies never really make it into the conversation. I think that's a little unfair, but we all agree that regardless of which movies you think are the best, that the prequels have their place in the story, and actually a really important place in the story, because if you don't have the backstory of like Darth Vader, for instance, you don't really know who he is. If you don't know who Anakin Skywalker is, you don't really know who Darth Vader is. If you don't know who Obi-Wan Kenobi is, you don't really know who Obi-Wan Kenobi is come episode four. The backstory tells you a lot about the present story, and it's kind of supposed to work that way, because that's the way a lot of stories work. That's even the way that our stories work. Like what we think about where we came from has everything to say about who we think we are as human beings. And so I would suggest that all of us, regardless of what our religious convictions might be, all of us have what I would call a functional origin story. Like we have a working explanation of how in the world we got here, how all of everything we see came into being. Like we have something we're working with. We may not really think about it very much. We might not really be able to articulate what it is. Some of us can, but maybe some of us aren't so sure. But whatever that functional origin story is, it has profound effects on what you think about yourself as a human being, who you think you are, what you're about, what you're for. And this morning, what I want us to do is we look at Genesis one, which is what we're calling the true and better story that you and I need. And I would even suggest that you and I, even if it's not the one we have, it's kind of the one we use to make sense of life. As we go through this one, I really want you to think through what is my functional origin story? And as we ask that question and then are confronted with the beauty and the power of this story, that we would be open to what God has to say to us this morning. So pray for us as we open God's word together. Father, I pray that our hearts would be open to you. I don't know everything that every person in this room brought in to this space, but it is certainly a mixture of wonderful and good things and also hard and painful experiences and questions, and even questions that might be very distracting right now. But Lord, we also trust that you know all of those things and you have appointed this time for us that under your word and by your spirit, we might be changed. And we ask it in Christ's name. Amen. I mentioned that we're calling this series a true and better story. Last week, we supplied you a postcard that looks like this. They weren't in the bulletin because we don't want to become annoying giving you things in the bulletin too often. But you can find these on the way out if you didn't grab one already. And the reason I'm recommending it to you is because on the back, there are a list of topics that we're covering, all right? And so last week, we looked at before the beginning and what the Bible tells us about what was going on before Genesis 1-1. And then today, we're talking about creation. And then next week, we're gonna talk about what it means to be made in the image of God in terms of gender, and the next week, dignity, and then diversity, work, rest, marriage, singleness, sex, sin, death, promise. That's it, that's all. We're just covering a few things, a few light topics. In fact, I thought again this week, like last week was the Trinity. And I told you, it feels like the easy one of the bunch. And now I'm like, actually creation is feeling like the easy one of the bunch, which is crazy for me to say out loud. Because way back when, when I was growing up, and I was in high school biology class. And my teacher was teaching me that we all, we just came from evolutionary process and all that. And I was a young buck trying to figure out what the Bible said about all these things. Like creation, evolution, that was what we were all digging into. Those were the questions that we were writing, or that I was writing papers on, and not getting good grades on, as a matter of fact. And wrestling through it, really thinking through it. And there are all kinds of questions having to do with how creation, the account of creation here, lines up with what we know about the world through science. So questions like the days, maybe that's been a question you've asked before. If you didn't notice, you probably noticed this last time through, when this was being read for us a moment ago, there's this rhythm of the first day, and the second day, and the third day, and the fourth, fifth, six. And six days, in the space of six days, God made all things. What you might not know is there's a debate, even within the church, and it's been going on for about 2,024 years, over how long is a day Okay, the obvious answer would be, well, maybe it seems like it would be 24-hour days. But the Hebrew word day, the word yom, has more of an expansive semantic range than that. And so theologians as far back as Augustine and others have said, well, maybe a day represents something longer than what we know as a day. Maybe it's a longer period of time. Maybe the earth isn't as young as some people say it is. And so even within a denomination like ours, the Presbyterian Church in America, which takes very seriously what the Bible says and wants to teach what the Bible says, there's a range of views as to the creation days, so much so that you can go and you can read our denominational study report, if you're really in the mood. It was published about 20 years ago, and it lays out all of what we would say are the biblical ways of understanding the creation days. And if that's a question that you have, I'd encourage you to read it. It's a really helpful, fairly short report. It's on our website. It's on the PCA website. That's an important question. It's just not the question we're gonna spend a lot of time with today. And I think what you just heard me say is it's not an important question. That's not what I said. And it is an important question. It's just not the question we're gonna spend time on today because I'm really aiming us toward everything else we're gonna talk about for the next couple months. And so in order to do that, I want us to really grapple with this idea that Genesis is the true and the better story. The true and the better story. Because there is a reason that the hot topics of the day in this cultural moment are questions about gender and sexuality and diversity and all the rest of the things that we're taking up. It's because people not only need to know that Christianity is true, we have all these questions now about whether Christianity is good. Whether following Jesus really leads to the good life. So to do that, we're gonna ask this question. What is your functional origin story? Have you given that much thought? And then that's sort of the question that's in the backdrop and I just want you to wrestle with. And then you need to know I'm going to argue for the next few minutes together that Genesis is the true and better story you need in order to make sense of your life as a human person. Genesis is the true and better story you need. And the reason for that is because only Genesis gives you meaning, beauty, and authority. Meaning, beauty, and authority. Let's take that first idea that Genesis gives us a sense of meaning, a sense of purpose and significance in the world. If you were, and you can do this, if you were to go back and you were to read all of the, what I would call the contemporary creation accounts from the time that Genesis was given to God's people. So the accounts that were given are like Babylonian culture, and Assyrian culture, and Mesopotamia. What you would find is across the board those other creation accounts are horrific stories. If they were made into Netflix miniseries you would not let your kids watch these shows. It's sort of like Game of Thrones meets The Bachelor. Okay, if you could mash those things up it's like that. It's sort of like the real housewives of Mesopotamia is what it feels like, all right? And the gods are arguing with each other. The plural gods are arguing with each other. That's how the stories open up. They're fighting with each other. They wanna trick each other. They're mutilating each other. And the creation is like this afterthought. It's what happens when the mutilated body parts get thrown into the seas. Then the earth comes and then the human beings are either an accident that annoy the gods or they are created purely to do all of the grunt labor that the gods don't wanna do. So that's what you're dealing with with all of those stories across the board. Every single one of them. Genesis, even in that culture, Genesis stood alone. And it still stands alone. Because in Genesis you have God calmly with the word creating. You have God, as we talked about last week, who is creating out of an overflow of love which is at the core of who he is, Father, Son, Holy Spirit, one God. Not out of chaos, not out of conflict, not out of warfare, out of love. And you have God creating men and women in his image, dignifying them, not as like slaves that just need to do the work that no one else wants to do, although sometimes it feels like that on Monday, but no, dignifying them as image bearers of God. Now we're gonna talk all about that for the next six weeks. I'll just leave it there. What you need to know is that this story, even in that culture, stood apart as completely different, a completely different accounting of reality. And I would say to you, it still stands completely different. Okay, even though you could go on the internet, maybe not right now, but another time, you can read all those stories, I have a feeling those Babylonian stories aren't gonna be interesting to you. Those aren't the ones that you learned in high school biology class or are learning in high school biology class. The story you're learning is the story that the modern secular world tells you. And make no mistake, the modern secular world, call it secular humanism or scientific materialism, it is a story, okay? It's presented as a theory of how all things came to be. It is very much a story in which you are situated, which defines who you are or aren't as a human being. So back in the day, when Carl Sagan was making PBS specials and movies and things like that, he was very famous for defining this way, this story like this. The universe is all that is, all that ever was, all that ever will be. That's not a theory, that's a story. And if I may say, that is a faith story. The fact that it sounds a little bit like the Gloria Potri is a little eerie as I read it, but it's a story about who you are and how you got here. The universe has always been here and always will be here. It'll be here when you're gone. Many people have connected the dots into how this informs who we are as human beings. The historian Carl Becker said this, human beings are little more than a chance deposit on the surface of the world, carelessly thrown up between two ice ages by the same forces that rust iron and ripen corn. That's a story of who you are or who you ain't. Some of you will know the name Stephen Jay Gould, the late scientist, paleontologist, was asked by Life Magazine, what is the meaning of life? His answer, we are here because one odd group of fishes had a peculiar fin anatomy that could transform into legs for terrestrial creatures. Because the earth never froze entirely during an ice age, we may yearn for a higher answer, but none exists. This explanation, though superficially troubling, if not terrifying, is ultimately liberating and exhilarating. Now, it may be liberating and exhilarating to Stephen Jay Gould, to Ricky Gervais, to Christopher Hitchens, the list goes on. It may be exhilarating and liberating for many people. I don't think that's an exhilarating and liberating explanation of who you are for most of us. I mean, for one thing, you've just gotta grapple with this idea that, wow, my life really, in the big scheme of things, doesn't really matter all that much at all, ever. And even if you sort of just accept that premise, then you set about the crushing task of having to create your own meaning in life. Because you know what that means. It means that you're always going to be asking, am I enough? Did I do enough? Did I succeed enough? Did I live a life that really counts? Did I live a life that really means anything? In other words, you are signing yourself up for a midlife crisis for all of life. So, I'm not saying it's not liberating and exhilarating for them. We could talk about the reasons why it might be, but I would say there are lots of reasons why it's not, that actually the absence of meaning creates a vacuum that we're very, very uncomfortable with. And that something down deep inside of us tells us, I feel like human beings are more than just a chance deposit on the surface of the planet. I think that's, this weekend, as we remember Martin Luther King, I think what he was about was about dignities, about the dignity of person and the dignity of personhood that's grounded in far more than just this idea that we showed up and we're here and let's just make the best of it. See, the truth is, most of us don't live that story. You may talk a good game, but most of us don't live that story. We borrow from another story. We borrow from this story that tells us that we are made with dignity and value and worth by a God who overflows with grace and love and glory, that we are made in his image, that we have purpose and significance because we are those who are designed to glorify God, to enjoy him forever and to reflect his image to the world. And this true and better story not only gives us a sense of meaning, it also gives us an account for why we are so attracted to beauty, creating it ourselves in art, appreciating it ourselves in the world and in the things that our fellow human beings make. In fact, reading Genesis 1 is a little bit like watching a great artist at work. Maybe you had a parent who was an artist, who was a painter, or your dad maybe was a carpenter. You just watch him make amazing things, watch her make amazing things, watch your grandmother knit or make a quilt over the months, over the years. It's amazing to watch someone who's creative create. But here's the difference. The difference with God is that when it comes to human beings, they have no choice, we have no choice, but to create something out of what already exists. So, you know, a sculptor uses stone or clay or a painter uses paint, et cetera, et cetera, but God, we're told, creates from nothing. The fancy Latin word, if you want to impress the community group, ex nihilo, God creates ex nihilo, he creates out of nothing. We see that in the first verse. In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. That's just another way of saying God created everything out of nothing, but it doesn't arrive in a finished state. There's still some work to do. In verse two, the earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And so we see that the rest of this chapter is really divided, the first three days, into God forming, and the next three days into God filling. Do you see that? God forms the earth into a place that supports life, and then God fills the earth with the abundance of living things. And what's interesting to me, well, maybe not interesting to me, but what I can relate to is the fact that even by day five, it's not like God gets bored. You know, this is such a tidy and orderly account, especially when you hear it read out loud. That wasn't just to test your patience. It was for us to feel the repetition, the rhythm, almost the liturgy of creation. And you can get the sense of like what's about to happen is kind of boring and bland, but it's not like on day five, God just like ran out of ideas for birds, you know? Like at three in the afternoon, it's like, ah, okay, let's just do some more chickadees and some more sparrows and press on, right? Like it is full of color and life and vibrancy. I love the fact that we get the word swarm more than once, just to give us a visual of what it looks like for these creatures to move through the water, flying through the expanse of the sea. There is a joy that accompanies this creation. It's the joy and the delight of God in his own creation and the beauty which is there. I was talking to a good friend of mine who is super into pandas. She's very sad that the pandas are leaving Washington, DC, as am I. But she pointed out to me, and neither of us are scientists, so some of you can correct us on this, but I think this seems like an interesting argument. She said, the reason I like pandas is because in some ways they're entirely impractical. So pandas have teeth, like the kind of teeth you'd need to be a meat eater, to be a carnivore, and yet they don't eat meat, they eat bamboo, and they look kind of cute when they do it. And pandas don't have a natural predator in the wild, and they don't prey on other animals, even though they're big, strong creatures, and all the rest, they could be, but they're not. Pandas, did you know, have very wiry, coarse fur, so you don't see people shearing pandas for panda coats, like Taylor Swift didn't walk into the game last night with a panda coat on, because it's not the kind of material you want to make clothing. Like, everything about a panda is like, makes you wonder, what are pandas good for? And the answer my friend has, we realize this is not a thoroughly scientific answer, but the answer she likes to think is this, they're good because they're cute. Like, the reason God made giant pandas is because they're delightful. And they're not just delightful to us, when we used to go to the zoo to see them, they're delightful to God himself. I mean, you can hear God delighting in his creation each and every day as it goes along, you heard that refrain as well, that repetition, and it was good, and it was good, and it was good, and then verse 31, we didn't get there, but you can skip ahead, verse 31, and he beheld everything that he made, and he said, behold, it is very good. Now, the Laughlin translation of that, that is the accurate translation, let me give you the Laughlin interpretation. The Laughlin interpretation of it is good is, good stuff. Such a great expression, good stuff. You can use good stuff for just about anything. A meal's good stuff, a good game's good stuff, you know, a good sermon, good stuff, right? Like, all of it, it's just good, good stuff, it just works, good stuff. That's not the reason I like it. The reason I like that phrase is because what God is dignifying with his benediction is stuff. It's physical stuff, and as, and I'll just, for those of us who are Christians and have been doing this for a while, our tendency is to think that God thinks spiritual stuff is good, and physical stuff is, meh. Maybe bad, but at least, meh. Like, spiritual good, physical, meh. Which is actually gonna inform our conversation going forward when we start talking about our bodies, physical stuff. No, actually, no, no, no. God is saying about all he has made, good stuff. We actually see this playing out in the early church in the book of 1 Timothy, the letter of 1 Timothy. Paul is writing to his protege Timothy, and Timothy's having a little trouble in the church. People are getting restless in the church, and there are some folks who come in, and they begin to teach that to be really spiritual, you need to not get married, and by not getting married, they also mean not having sex, and by not having sex, they continue that conversation to say, and abstain from certain foods and certain drinks, because that's what spiritual people do. They don't get all mixed up with the physical stuff, and so Paul says to Timothy in his letter, he says, yeah, this is how you deal with that. Remember, everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving. Everything is good, and then there's this governing principle, so Paul doesn't say, everything's good, so go for it. He says, everything is good. It should be received in thanksgiving. This is sort of the governing principle, which is when we receive what God has given according to his guidance and his commandments and his design, we receive it with thanksgiving. We'll come back to that, but it's a good reminder for us as Christians that we ought to be the most grateful people on the planet, not just for the good stuff that we have in our spiritual relationship, but the good stuff that God gives us. Now, some of you are thinking, all right, Laughlin has never seen Planet Earth, the miniseries. He's never seen the blue planet. He's never talked to anybody who is an atheist who still has an inherent sense of wonder and awe at creation. No, I have, and I'm not gonna dismiss that at all. I think there are lots of people who are living in a different story who are still living with a profound sense of gratitude and awe and wonder. I will grant you that, but I would also push just a little bit to say, if we really do live in a meaningless universe, how deep does that appreciation of beauty really go? And I'm stealing that, I will tell you, I'm stealing that idea from C.S. Lewis in one of his essays. He's writing about this idea, and he says to the materialist, to the person who's living in the modern secular story, you might decide simply to have a good time. Like, that just may be your mantra in life, have as good a time as possible. The universe is a universe of nonsense, after all, but since you're here, grab what you can. Sounds kind of, sort of familiar. I think I've heard that before. Unfortunately, Lewis says, there is, on these terms, so very little left to grab, only the coarsest sensual pleasures. You can't even, in the lowest animal sense, be in love with a girl or a boy if you know and keep on remembering that all the beauty of that person are a momentary and accidental pattern produced by the collision of phosphorescence arising from the behavior of your genes. You can't go on getting any very serious pleasure from music if you know and remember that its air of significance is a pure illusion, and that you only like it because your nervous system is irrationally conditioned to like it. You may still feel, in the lowest sense, that you're having a good time, but you will be forced to feel the hopeless disharmony between your own emotions and the universe in which you live. And what he's saying is, the modern secular story does not account for our experience of beauty, the beauty of romantic love, the beauty of music, the beauty that moves us into a place of transcendence. It doesn't account for it. It lets you enjoy it to a point, but at some point, you have to let go and stop remembering what story you're really living in in order to really experience it. And what I'm suggesting to you is, even the person who is committed to that story in those moments cheats and borrows from this story, this story that says that we were made by a God of beauty who made this world beautiful and who placed the longing of eternity in every human heart, and you can't escape that. And it's actually those moments of beauty that begin to wake us up to the fact that we are hardwired. We are hardwired to admire and to create beauty. So it's this story, the true and better story of Genesis that gives us a sense of meaning and beauty and authority. And I dropped that one in at the very beginning, hoping you wouldn't notice, all right? Because I said, these are things we need in order to thrive as human beings. We need meaning, okay, yep. Beauty, okay, authority, hmm. So I hoped you hadn't really thought about it until now. I do want you to think about it now because Genesis 1 is a package deal. If you want the meaning and the beauty that this story gives you, you also have to reckon with the authority that comes with it. And ultimately, as much as I love you guys and I want us to think about ourselves, Genesis 1 is not a story about you. This is a story about God. Now, you are the jewel of his creation and we'll talk about that, but this is a story about in the beginning, God. And in the beginning, God spoke. Did you notice the pattern there? God speaks and it was so. God speaks and it was so. God speaks and it was so. There's no like thinking about whether or not to take that direction. Talking about my truth and your truth. None of that. God speaks, it happens. This is the kind of authority that we're dealing with. And it's not just the authority that we were dealing, it's the authority that we're dealing with now. Which is perhaps why someone who would erase God completely out of the story feels some level of liberation and exhilaration. You kind of get out from under that authority. But see, I told you already that I don't think most people go there. 90% of Americans believe in a God or a higher power. 90%. 90%. Why do you think that is? Because most people aren't willing to accept the premise that they're nothing more than a chance deposit on the surface of the world. Most people look around and are like, I just can't believe that all this came from nothing. I just can't buy it. So that's true. What story are many people living in, maybe some of us? I think it goes like this. God made the world, I guess, and then he like tossed us the keys. Go and do your thing, be happy, be nice to each other, try not to mess the place up. I think a lot of people have, I mean, that's good old-fashioned deism, if you wanna put a name on it, but I think that's how a lot of people live. Like God made the world and then like, there you go, guys. Try not to mess it up, which we have, which is the point, which is why there's more to the Bible than Genesis 1. And two, there's Genesis 3, in which Adam and Eve weren't given permission just to take the keys and run with it, but they did. And you have the first functional deists in all human history who basically say, oh, I see, okay, God made the world and then I get to be my own authority and define for myself what the good life looks like and define for myself what authority looks like. Great, we're gonna make this place awesome. It's not awesome. The world you and I woke up in this morning, the world that that sort of posture toward God created, it's not awesome. If you haven't noticed, it's beautiful. It's also terrible. Violence, sickness, and death. It's awful. See, that doesn't, that story doesn't work either. And that's why we need to remember that the story we find in the Bible is not just Genesis 1 and 2, it's the rest of the Bible, even Genesis 3, where Adam and Eve plunged this world into misery and God ran right after them to bring us back. I mean, the story of the rest of the Bible is the story of God making good on his promise to win back everything we have lost, to redeem everything we have ruined. And he did it through Jesus. Listen to Colossians 1, maybe just with Genesis 1 in the background and what you know about Genesis 3 in the background, Genesis 1, verse 20, through Jesus, God has reconciled to himself all things, whether in earth or in heaven, making peace by blood, by the blood of his cross. All things. God doesn't look at creation and go, you guys messed it up, we're done. He says, I'm taking all of it back. Every square inch. It's mine. And he says to you, I'm not gonna leave you in ruin, I'm gonna win you back through Jesus. You're mine. Is that your story? It's not your story, is that the story that informs what it means to be you today? We pray for us. Father, we ask now that this true and better story full of grace and truth, full of beauty and redemption would be more compelling to us even now. Lord, I pray for my friends here who are still thinking through, what do I believe about all of this? Lord, give them wisdom, lead them in all of truth. And I pray for my brothers and sisters here who know this, who have been taught this story from the time they were small. Thank you for your faithfulness in walking with us as our shepherd. And yet, Lord, now we pray that you would press in even more. And that the full implications and significance of this story would come crashing in on us, the meaning and beauty and authority you have given us for our good and for your glory. Lord, would you do that so that we, as you send us out today, so that we would be agents of hope that this world belongs to you and that one day you will make all things new. Until that day, Lord, give us faith. And we ask it in Jesus' name, amen.
