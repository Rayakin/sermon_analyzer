Good morning, everybody. It's good to be with you. My name is Ryan and I'm one of the pastors here. We're opening up to Psalm 19 this morning. We've already sung it once, we've already read it once, and now we're going to dig in just a little bit. You may notice that the subtitle of this psalm tells us this is one of the many psalms that King David wrote. So the subtitle tells us that. I think you could probably get a pretty good sense for that based on verse one. Verse one, the heavens declare the glory of God. That's the sort of thing someone might say who has spent their formative years sleeping under the stars like a shepherd would, as King David would have, waking up to the sun rising every day. This was an impression that was deep in his soul. And it's not just verse one that gives us that clue. It's also the very last verse, verse 14, which is this wonderful prayer. I'll often use it. In fact, I'll probably use it in a moment when we pray for our time in God's word, that our hearts would match our words, that what we say would match what we really believe, that we would want to live a life of integrity. The Bible tells us that King David was a man after God's own heart, that he really desired that his life would reflect this kind of wholeness, this kind of virtue, this kind of authenticity. And it's not just David who feels this way. I think all of us feel this way. Even if we might define virtue differently, we might define the good life differently, there's something deep inside of us that longs to have our deepest convictions lived out consistently, that what we say would match what we believe, that we wouldn't be such a mystery to ourselves like we are, and that we would live a life that is pleasing to God. And what's wonderful about Psalm 19, one of the wonderful things about it is that in a fairly short amount of verses, it gives us a pathway to live that kind of life. And so this morning, as we look at this psalm, I want to consider what it looks like to live the life that's described for us here by David, which I believe ultimately is a life all of us long to live. So let's pray together, and then we'll dig into God's word. Father, I do pray that the words of my mouth and the meditation of all of our hearts would be pleasing, acceptable in your sight, our Lord, our rock, and our Redeemer. Amen. Now about five, six hundred years ago, the theologian John Calvin began his masterpiece of theology, Institutes of the Christian Religion, with this sentence. Nearly all of the wisdom we possess, that is to say all true and sound wisdom, consists of two parts, knowledge of God and knowledge of self. Now, I would encourage you, if you feel so led, to pick up the two volumes of the Institutes and read the 2,000 or 3,000 pages that are there. Knock yourself out. You might literally knock yourself out when you try to do that. It's heavy. And so if that's up your alley, go for it. It is certainly a rewarding time in that work. But what's great about Psalm 19 is it tells us basically the same thing in 14 verses. And so this isn't the shorthand of the Institutes, but it gives us the same basic lesson that wisdom, true wisdom, sound wisdom, is discovered in two things, knowing God and knowing ourselves. So that's what I want to look at this morning, what this passage tells us about knowing God and what it tells us about knowing ourselves. First of all, what does this passage tell us about knowing God? Well, David explains to us in this psalm two things, that we can know God through his world and through his word, through his world and through his word. He begins the psalm, we've already mentioned it, verse one, the heavens declare the glory of God. I want you to notice that in those first few verses, what's being made very clear to us by David is that the world has a message, okay? The heavens declare the glory of God, the heavens declare, the skies proclaim, the days pour forth speech, the language there is gushes out language, and what is that message? The message is the glory of God. This is not a message that is a faint signal, this is not, for those of you who remember trying to dial into your favorite radio station, remember the knobs on the radio, you go like 1 24th of an inch this way, you wouldn't quite have it, 1 24th of an inch this way, you wouldn't, finally you got it, you didn't touch it, maybe if you move closer you'd get it, move away you didn't get it. We're not talking about that kind of signal that you have to lock into. This is a broadcasted message, it goes everywhere to everyone for all time. And the beautiful thing is, you don't have to sleep under the stars like David to receive that message, you just have to be a mildly observant human being. Like I'm keeping the bar pretty low here, mildly observant. When you go on vacation to the beach, if you can take a second to stop thinking about how you look in your swimsuit, I know it's difficult, and you walk to the ocean, you put your ankles in the water and you look out and you see the vast ocean and the expanse of the horizon, where if you're hiking in the mountains this summer, you already did, hopefully you took some time to just stop and breathe in the fresh air and look at the vista and consider the grandeur of the mountains. Or if it's just too hard for you to get off your phone these days, then do this, instead of scrolling through Instagram, look up images from the James Webb telescope that we all saw about two or three years ago and begin to look at images no human eye has seen before, galaxies within galaxies, stars being born, and ask yourself a simple question that any observant, mildly curious person would ask, how did all of this get here? Better yet, who is responsible for all of this? Even better, how do I account for all of this beauty and complexity in the world? Have you ever asked that question? Have you ever asked that question? Have you ever dared to answer that question? Now the psalmist is saying that is a step toward knowing God, being a mildly observant human being and looking at the world and asking the basic question, how did this all get here? And while we're at it, how did you get here? But see, the world isn't going to give you the exhaustive answer to that question. So David turns from God's world to God's word. Notice that the transition is fairly seamless. He doesn't give us a heads up. All of a sudden, he's going from talking about the sun to talking about the law, the word. Verse 7, the law of the Lord is perfect. Now this makes sense because if you do come to the conclusion, let's just say you're here this morning and let's say I'm preaching to the choir, literally I'm preaching to some of the choir, but figuratively speaking, I'm preaching to the choir and you already walked in here like, Ryan, I already figured that out. Like I looked around, I figured out in my life that yes, someone must be behind everything that I see. That's just the only plausible explanation I can come to. But you see, you can't stop there because that invites other questions like, well, okay, then if there is a God who made all things, he must be pretty big and pretty majestic and pretty glorious and he must have made me and he must have certain expectations of me and what are those expectations and what does it even look like for me to have a relationship with him? You see, the questions start cascading and those are questions that, you know, the sunset and the mountain views can't give you the answer to those questions. You have to go to God's word to get those questions. That's what we call creation general revelation, talks generally to generally everybody. And then we have special revelation. This word spoken to us begins to answer some of those questions like, what is God like? Who is he? And what does he want with me? And that's where David turns next. And so he says, the law of the Lord is perfect. Now, the words that David uses are worth pointing out and just to kind of run through the catalog beginning with verse 7, if you look with me there, the law of the Lord is perfect. The testimony of the Lord is sure. Verse 8, the precepts of the Lord, the commandment of the Lord, the fear of the Lord, the rules of the Lord. Okay, that list is not the most exciting list in the world, right? I mean, I know some of you do this for a living, okay? You practice law for a living, you make laws for a living, you assess laws for a living. I get that and that's good. But when it comes to our personal lives, words like law, precepts, rules, those at least at first don't seem to be leading to the kind of life that we want because rules and laws and commandments, those feel very restrictive to us. That doesn't seem to lead to any level of authenticity. And yet David talks about these things as if they're awesome. He says the law of the Lord is perfect. They revive the soul. They don't restrict me, they set me free. The commandments of the Lord are pure, they enlighten my eyes, they give me wisdom. He goes on even to say in verse 10, the law of the Lord, the commandments of the Lord are more desirable than gold. And just in case we missed it, not like an ounce of gold, like much fine gold and like sweet honey, like it's better than all the money in the world. It's better than all the pleasure in the world. That's what my heart longs for. It's for the law of the Lord. And these things don't go together very well in our heads. Even as Christians, it sounds kind of like legalism to us to be so excited about the rules and the laws when people around us are really excited about the rules and the laws. They're like, ah, not sure I want to hang out with you. But David's like, this is where it's at. Why does he say that? Why does he say that the law, the precepts, the commandments bring life where there was only death? It's because David's thinking of it this way. If the God whose glory fills the skies, if that God made everything you see, he also made you. And if he made you, then he knows what's best for you. And that the laws and commands that he gives us as normative human behavior is not contrary to how we're made. It's in line with the creational norm. It's in line with how we're designed. That's why a friend of mine loves to call the Bible his owner's manual, all right? So like when that little indicator light goes up on your dashboard and you can't remember what it is or you've never seen it before, you reach over to the glove compartment, not while you're driving, but you pull over and you reach in the glove compartment and you pull it out and you look it up in the index and you finally found it. And you're like, okay, that's what that is. That's what I need to take care of next. It's the owner's manual and I think it's a pretty good analogy that when we read the word of the Lord, even the parts that search us out, even the parts that direct us, even the parts that command us, those are given to us for our good by the one who made us. So I like that. And then on the other hand, I kind of don't like that. And here's why I kind of don't like that. I've never told my friend I don't like it, but here's kind of the reason I don't like it because it's easy for us to think of the Bible as an owner's manual, as if it's here to help us learn how to live our best life now. That it's just a collection of information and wise sayings and principles that you apply to your life and you kind of maximize your life. That's very dangerous for us because we're so attracted to that, but also because it gets away from really the main purpose of God's word. It's not information, it's invitation. So that word revelation isn't so much revealing information we need, it's revealing the God who made us. You see, God's word is here so that we might have a living encounter with the living God. God's word helps us know him, invites us to know him. Not just know about him or not just kind of know about what he wants for us, but actually to know him. And that's why if this is a foreign concept to us, or maybe you've never thought about this idea that you could actually know God, the place to go is maybe not Psalm 19. The place to go to begin is probably the gospels, it's probably those biographies of Jesus we find in the New Testament, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, because there we find Jesus revealing God for us in the most excellent way, in the fullest sense of the word. God stepping onto the stage of human history and putting himself in everyday situations, the kind of situations you and I deal with. And there we learn who God is and what he's like and actually what he had to do in order for us to have a relationship with him. That's why the gospel of John chapter 1 tells us, no one has ever seen God, but when you see Jesus, you see God. He makes himself known. The Bible is God's self-disclosure, which by the way is a beautiful and necessary moment of friendship. I mean, every friend is a friend because at some point they've disclosed themselves to you. They've brought you in. They've said, this is who I really am. And in scripture, God discloses himself so that we might know him. I would also say that the reason starting with Jesus is so important and returning to Jesus is so important when it comes to knowing God is because Jesus really stands at the intersection of knowing God and knowing yourself. When you know Jesus, you know God, but you also learn some things about yourself because Jesus came for a reason and that reason happens to be you. You see the same dynamic going on here in Psalm 19. It's kind of hard to figure out where David stops talking about knowing God and where he starts talking about knowing himself because these two things are so interwoven. By separating them, we're sort of doing some violence to the very idea that these things go together, but we're doing it anyway for the sake of clarity. I do want to talk about not just knowing God, but now I want to talk about knowing yourself and how this passage helps us know ourselves. The reason this is so important, I think, is because we live in a culture which emphasizes so heavily knowing yourself. If you're a young person here, maybe you're in college or maybe you're preparing to go to college or maybe you're beginning of your career in your 20s or early 30s, when I talk to you, a lot of conversations we're having are about the future. You're trying to figure out where to go to school. You're trying to figure out what career to choose or how to switch careers or where to live or just all of those life decisions that we're faced with in those years. What I find is as much as those are conversations about circumstances and about decisions, they're ultimately conversations about you. What am I good at? What am I called to do? What job is going to be best for me? Right alongside that, and I think this is often what's frustrating for all of us, not just for young people, but for all of us, is right alongside those questions that demand a certain amount of self-knowledge is this frustration with yourself. Right alongside this pressure you feel to know yourself well enough to make the right decision, you do things that confuse you. Have you ever noticed that? Now, older people, we can join in on this one too because we all make decisions that after we make them, we go, why did I decide to do that? Why did I just say that? Like the moment those words come out of your mouth, like what just came out of my mouth and why? Or why did I act out that way? Why did I lash out that way? So even though there's this huge emphasis on knowing yourself, the reality is we're often kind of mysteries to ourselves at the very same time. I love the way that the writer Walker Percy put it in a question, a sort of pose to humankind, to folks such as yourself. He asked this question. Why is it possible to learn more in 10 minutes about the Crab Nebula in Taurus, which is 6,000 light years away, than you presently know about yourself, even though you've been stuck with yourself all your life? And that was written before the internet age, so that's even more true now. There are things you can learn about in five minutes. Some of you are doing it right now on the internet. And even though you're stuck with yourself your entire life, you still remain a mystery to yourself. Well, I don't really know much about the Crab Nebula. I did spend about five minutes looking it up, so I'd have something to talk to you about after. It is pretty amazing, actually. But five, 10 minutes in Psalm 19 actually teaches you quite a bit about yourself that you may not have walked in here thinking about, possibly. Because David, if nothing else, he's self-aware. And he's self-aware primarily of how much he needs God to speak into his life. So did you notice one of the things that is most desirable for him about the Word of God is the fact that it warns him? Notice right after he praises how desirable it is, in verse 10 he says, and verse 11, moreover, by them your servant is warned. Again, that doesn't always add up. Those aren't the voices we're always looking for in life, those that warn us. But it gets better. He talks in verse 12 about the need for God to help him discern his errors, to point out where he's gone wrong. And even more than that, verse 12, to help him see his hidden faults, like his blind spots. And for God to keep him back from presumptuous sins, those are prideful sins, those are the sins that come about when you say, well, God's not going to forgive me anyway, so I'll just do what I want, presuming on God's grace. And not only that, but that God would keep him from great transgression, which each and every one of us are fully capable of, the kind of transgression that shipwrecks your life. Let me just say, this is not the Oprah-approved self-actualization plan. All right? This is step one of the Oprah-approved self-actualization plan, which you can find in just about any movie, you can find all over the internet in every self-help book. What is step one? Step one is to press mute on all the voices who tell you you're wrong. Step one is to affirm who you are, to first of all know who you are, if you can figure that one out, and then affirm who you are, and then accept who you are, and surround yourself with people who are like, yep, yep, yep, yep, cheer you on the entire time. Get a community of cheerleaders around you, not naysayers, not people who are going to tell you, you know, you don't see this about yourself, but it ain't good. Like nope, you need to get rid of those people, and you need to get positive people into your life. Right? But David said, actually, no, the way to self-knowledge, the way to health, is to invite the person who knows you best and knows all things to confront you, to be humble enough to listen to that. And it takes some humility. Let me give you an example. About a month ago, I was going for a run on the WNOD trail. What a gift to the community, by the way. Some of you in this room actually helped put parts of that together. It's true. Some of you did. Members of this church. Awesome place to go for a run, or go for a bike ride, or Segway, whatever people do on there. But I was going for a run. Early in the morning, I'm running along, minding my own business, headphones in, listening to whatever my soundtrack was for that day, plodding along at a sweet 12 and a half minute mile pace, just cruising, right? Beautiful morning. I'm saying hi to people, I'm kind of giving them the point, the wave, and all that. And all of a sudden, on my right, a cyclist comes flying past, slows down long enough to yell at me from across the trail, wrong side of the trail. Okay? So my first instinct was to pray for him. No, it was not. My first instinct, seriously, this is what I thought. I was like, I'm going to run after him, and I'm going to say, no, pal, you're on the wrong side of the trail. That's what I was going to say. I decided not to, because I would hurt myself very badly if I accelerated to that pace. And then I began to think to myself, I'm on this trail all the time. I know what the right side of the trail is. And I'm running with all these people, no one else has said I'm on the wrong side of the trail. Who does he think he is? Why is he yelling at me that I'm on the wrong side of the trail? And then it occurred to me, I was on the wrong side of the trail. Like it wasn't even like this far. I was over there. I was running into oncoming traffic. People have been avoiding me for five minutes, and I'm on that trail all the time. And I just spaced out. Like I was just in the wrong place, and he was 100% right. But notice my first reaction wasn't, oh, silly me. It was, why would you think you have the right to tell me I'm not in the right spot? And then I began to think, that person might be a member of my church. So if it was you, thank you, I guess, and we'll talk after. Notice the thought process. I mean, it's not just true on a Tuesday morning on a run. It's true all the time. We don't invite that kind of criticism into our life. And when we get it, our first instinct is not to go, yeah, you're right, I'm an idiot. It's to justify ourselves. I justified myself for a good 93 seconds. And then I literally started laughing out loud. I'm like, darn it, that's going to have to go in a sermon. Because it's not just true the way I run, it's true the way I live. Like when God confronts me in his word, you're on the wrong side of the trail. My first instinct isn't always positive. When people in my life say, you're on the wrong side of the trail, my first reaction isn't, you know, thank you for that, I needed that. It's to justify myself, to say, no, you're on the wrong side of the trail, or you don't have the right to talk to me that way, or maybe you don't know where you are. David is humble enough, he knows himself well enough to know that he needs a God in his life and people in his life who can point out his hidden faults, which by definition are hidden, can't see them. Need people in his life who keep him from great transgression. People in his life who can say to him, who do you think you are to talk to me that way, to treat people like that? Humble enough to recognize that we need grace. Now for some of us, I would suspect this is pretty much characteristic of every interaction you have with God. Like your relationship with God right now is basically a lot of drive-by interactions. We feel like you're just getting a lot of like wrong side of the trail conversations and then he's off to whatever it is he does, causing the sun to rise and all the other things. And I get that, you know, I think part of the reason we feel that way is because that fits pretty well with the narrative we hear in our culture about what it means to relate to God. Dan Strange, in one of his books, Theologian, uses this analogy. He says in our world, in our 21st century, late modern world, the narrative goes like this. We're all playing a game of cosmic hide and seek with God. And wouldn't you know it, God's really good at hiding. And we're really good at seeking, because we're smart, sophisticated, educated people and we've been seeking for centuries and he's nowhere to be found. So the solution is either we can't find him or he doesn't want to be found or maybe he's just not there at all. And so we just kind of go about our business and follow our hearts and all that stuff. And then Strange says, well, there's some truth to that. We are in a game of cosmic hide and seek, but God's not the one hiding. I mean, Psalm 19 makes that perfectly clear. Psalm 19 begins, verse 1, God is waving his arms every single day in your face. The glory of God is declared in the heavens. Like, God is not the one hiding, we're the ones hiding. And the Bible would tell us, we come by this honestly. Our first parents, first response to shame and guilt was to hide. We've been hiding ever since. Romans 1 would say, the world gives us, the glory and creation gives us no excuse for not believing that someone, namely God, is behind all of it. And yet rather than receiving that knowledge and being humbled, we suppress it. You know what suppress means? Suppress means what you have to do with a basketball when you're in the pool, okay? Push it down once, what happens? It's going to shoot right back up five feet in the air. You got to sit on it. You know, you got to stand on it. You got to push it down. And this is the image that we're given in Romans 1 of the way that human beings deal with the divine knowledge that God is there and he has actually expectations for your life. We don't just push it down once, we have to continue to work to push it down. And then we have to find substitute gods that we have some access to what we think is identity and satisfaction and fulfillment. I mean, that's the human condition. God's not the one hiding, we're the ones hiding. But the good news is not only that God is a terrible hider, but God is also a tenacious seeker. And that too is the beginning of the story. Like our first parents, they were wooed out of hiding by God who came and found them immediately. And God has never stopped searching. I referenced a few moments ago, the gospels, the gospel of Luke tells us that when Jesus arrived, he stated that his mission statement was to seek and to save the lost. God came looking for us. Jesus who obeyed the perfect law perfectly, something we don't do. Jesus who went to the cross to die for all of our sins, hidden, presumptuous, great, and otherwise. Jesus who in rising again set us free from the penalty and the power of sin so that this morning you and I, we can step into the light. We can be honest that we don't have it all together. We can be honest that we're a mess, that we need forgiveness and grace. We can live the life we crave, which is one of wholeness in which the inclinations and desires of our hearts begin more and more to match our words, our actions. We can be real with each other. We can be real with God and we can make this prayer our own. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable to you because our God is our rock and our redeemer. Amen. Let me pray for us. Father, we thank you for your word. We thank you that it does search us out and lead us to Jesus. We pray, Father, even now that as we worship you for your work in creation and your work in redemption, that our hearts would be alive to your presence in our lives and that these wonderful words of Psalm 19 would be our own. And we ask it in Jesus' name, amen.
