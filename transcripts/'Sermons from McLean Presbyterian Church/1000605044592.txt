Our reading is from page 855, the opening paragraph of the biography of Jesus written by Luke. We call it The Gospel According to Luke, page 855. As you're turning there, I knew I was going to love this church from the time I had a Zoom with Ryan and with Matt Stone months ago now. I just felt such a connection and to be here in the service, to hear the joy in the singing was so uplifting for me. The psalm at the beginning, the confession of sin, and the prayer even ended with amen instead of amen. I don't know if that was to make me feel at home or just that you speak the Queen's English. But, boy, I'd make this my church if I lived within Cooee. That's not an expression he uses, is it, Cooee? Okay. Don't worry, it's got a back story. Page 855, the opening paragraph of Luke's gospel. Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the things that have been accomplished among us, just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the Word have delivered them to us, it seemed good to me also, having followed all things closely for some time past, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, that you may have certainty concerning the things you have been taught. This is the Word of the Lord. Christianity is increasingly doubted. Not in all places, of course. Christianity is booming in Africa, China, India, and Iran, but in our neck of the woods, Christianity is doubted. I was explaining to the folks yesterday that Australia just two years ago passed a very interesting social threshold. The government announced through the census figures that now only a minority of Australians see themselves as aligned in any way with Christianity. It's a great fanfare. Just last year, the UK announced the same thing. I was there in Oxford in November, and it was all the talk, Britain, now, minority Christian country. And there was great fanfare. And based on your current figures, you're not even ten years behind. I don't believe these things are really sociologically determined, but ten years ago, nearly 80 percent of Americans said they were some kind of Christian. Now it's down to 62 percent. Five or ten years from now, it'll be a minority on current trends. And very key Christian ideas are publicly scorned and doubted. I'm not sure if you saw the Washington Post article from just a couple of Christmases ago. Timed with Christmas, did historical Jesus really exist? The evidence just doesn't stack up. And the author concluded, in sum, there are clearly good reasons to doubt Jesus' historical existence if not to think it outright improbable. Washington Post. Now I'm sorry to say, the author was an Australian. I apologize. Worse than that, he was a former student of mine at Sydney University. I'm really sorry about that. And in Australia, just last year, they released a very interesting piece of research that found that half of all Australians doubt that Jesus was even a historical figure. Americans aren't that crazy. But doubt is everywhere, and it's such a contrast to the confidence of this opening paragraph of the biography of Jesus written by Luke in the first century, where Luke reckons you can have certainty. That's what he says at the end there, isn't it? Seemed good also to me, having followed everything for some time past, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, that you may have certainty. The Greek term there, translated certainty, is asphyleia, from which we get the word, I always get this wrong in American, asphalt. But you say it's the stuff they make roads out of? Asphalt. Asphalt. Is that right? It means sturdy, solid, that you may know the solidness of the things. So we've got doubt everywhere, and we've got the claim that this is actually solid. And so what I want to do in our time together is offer you three, hopefully quick thoughts about doubt, and then three quick thoughts about the solidness of Luke's narrative. Sound like a plan? I know that sounds like a six-point sermon, but just think of it as two points. The first thing to say, of course, is that there are different kinds of doubt, and one kind of doubt is intellectual doubt. It's just the normal, healthy response of a thinking human being, if you come across counter-evidence, to have an intellectual doubt. You might read a Washington Post article saying Jesus didn't live, and you might go, oh wow, that's half compelling. We might see a History Channel documentary saying the same thing, and you find yourself doubting intellectually, and I don't think that's a bad thing. So long as we do what Luke himself did, remember he said he followed all things closely. This is actually investigation language in the original Greek, investigating everything. So by all means, have your intellectual doubts, but investigate as well, because I am more than ever convinced that there is no question you could bring to the Christian faith that hasn't been comprehensively answered by some nerd in some book in some library somewhere. So follow. Use your intellect. But I have to offer a caveat here about intellectual doubt. Don't rely on the intellect too much, because there's some very interesting research about high IQ. Jonathan Haidt is the professor of evolutionary psychology at New York University, and he wrote that screamingly famous book, The Righteous Mind. It was in the New York Times bestseller list for ages. He's an atheist, but his book is about belief formation, how we form beliefs about politics, ethics, religion, and even science. One of the sidebars of the psychological research is that high IQ people are not better at arriving at the truth of a proposition than average IQ people. The special ability high IQ people have is the capacity to rationalize what they already believe to themselves and to others. Haidt says in the literature, it's framed as they're very good at finding my side arguments. I find this fascinating. The superpower of a hyper-intelligent person is the ability to convince themselves of something, and often to convince others. So I'm just saying, by all means, follow your intellect, but don't be fooled into thinking the intellect is everything. But there's another kind of doubt. It's not intellectual doubt. It's moral doubt. This is where we doubt the Christian faith because the Christian faith says something I don't like. I read something in the Christian faith about ambition, sex, or power, or money, whatever the issue, and I don't like it. I'd prefer to go another way, and that creates a cognitive dissonance, and there are two ways to relieve the dissonance. One is to doubt myself and believe the Bible, and the other is to doubt the Bible and believe myself. People often take the out of doubting what the Bible says about these topics. They don't doubt their doubts. They doubt the Bible. That's moral doubt, and it's not a super-healthy thing. The third kind of doubt comes from a softer place, a more reasonable place. It's what you might call psychological doubt. This is just the protective mechanism our brains play on us when we're thinking about taking a big step, making a big commitment. It's just a natural psychological protective mechanism. It's the cold feet on a wedding day. So much hangs on what's about to happen that you doubt. To give a silly example, I remember when I was in high school and I had a crush as a 15-year-old on this lovely girl, and my friends came to me one day and said, we heard from her friends she likes you. Instead of saying, yeah, that seems plausible, I went into a spin of doubt. No, it can't be true, is it? No, it can't be true, is it? Silly, but what's going on there? It's my mind playing past protection. It's protecting me from being hurt. So much hangs on the proposition that she liked me, that I found myself doubting it. Of course, people, when they approach the Christian faith, when they're seriously considering the Christian faith, they experience psychological doubt. You get close to it, and then your brain says, are you sure? Could be making a fool of yourself. My view is that when you're faced with psychological doubt, you don't fret, you take a deep breath, and you take the next little step in the right direction. Not a giant leap, just a little step. Intellectual doubt, moral doubt, psychological doubt. Let me turn from doubt back to our passage and talk about the solidness of this message of Jesus Christ, what we call the gospel, which is the name attached to this biography of Jesus written by Luke. It's clear, isn't it, in his introduction that he's in the realm of history, not myth. If this were a different kind of class, I'd compare Luke's introduction to stuff we have from historical writings in, say, Josephus and Polybius and Dionysius of Halicarnassus. Clear history writers who opened their writings very similarly to Luke. We are clearly in the realm of history. This is not a myth from Middle Earth. This is history from the Middle East. And Luke indicates this in a number of ways. There is much we could draw out of this just opening paragraph, but I just want to say three things about the solidness of his story. Number one, he indicates that it's based on multiple sources. It's the first thing he tells us. Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the things that have been accomplished among us, just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word have delivered them to us. Many narratives had already been written when Luke wrote his gospel, probably around the year 70, maybe a few years after. If this were a different kind of talk, more like a lecture than a sermon, I would go through the non-Christian sources from antiquity that mention Jesus. Marabath Serapion, Josephus, Pliny, Tacitus, Baretta Sanhedrin. And I would point out that even if we didn't have a single Christian source, we could still construct a broad narrative of Jesus without ever having had a Christian write about it. This is why you won't find a professor of ancient history or classics in any university in the world who argues Jesus didn't live. I know that because I've had a challenge out there in the media for ten years saying if you can find one professor of ancient history or classics in any university in the world who argues Jesus didn't live, I'll eat a page of my Bible. And I will. I'll chop up Matthew chapter one, I'll put it on Vegemite toast so I wouldn't be able to taste it. But for ten years, my Bible's safe. They've found professors of poetry and folklore and psychology, but not professors from the relevant disciplines. But actually, Luke is talking about Christian sources, I suspect. By the time he writes just forty years after Jesus, he says many have compiled narratives. Mainstream secular scholars reckon we can detect in Luke's gospel three separate sources. You don't really need to know the details, but feel free to come and ask me the details if you want. And more than that, mainstream secular scholars think that within the New Testament itself, there are five to seven separate sources that haven't been copied from one another. So when he says many have compiled narratives, he's not exaggerating. We're pretty sure we know the sorts of narratives he's talking about. And the reason this is important, to know that there are multiple sources here, is that it fulfills one of the most basic criteria of the study of history. It's called the criterion of multiple attestation, which you can forget as soon as you hear it. It just means when multiple sources say roughly the same thing about an event or person from the past, that event or person becomes more plausible. It's just the same logic you would apply if a friend told you some surprising news. You may or may not believe it, depending on how much you trust the friend. But if you hear it from a separate source and you know that source didn't get it from the first source, same news basically, you're more likely to believe it. If you have five to seven sources and you're pretty confident they didn't all get it from each other, you are applying the criterion of multiple attestation. You're just not pretentious enough to call it that. You call it common sense. But it's a bedrock in the study of history. And my point is, the many sources that Luke refers to do all, in different ways, speak of the same figure, teacher, healer, crucified, and even seen by others after his death. Multiple sources. The second thing I want to say about the solidness of Christianity is the early date of the source sources. Luke indicates this in a lovely way. I want you to notice, Luke freely admits he wasn't an eyewitness. Just soak that up for a second. Because what he says, you see there in verse 2, just as those from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers, the word delivered them to us. No claim to be an eyewitness. That's fascinating. If eyewitnesses were made up, why didn't he make himself an eyewitness? There's truth-telling right there, but nonetheless, he is someone who received eyewitness testimony. That places him within a generation of the events themselves. We can confirm from another text, by the way, that the author of Luke was present in Jerusalem amongst eyewitnesses in the 40s AD, within 15 to 20 years of the events. Even if Luke didn't write his gospel until 70, or a few years after that, his acquaintance with the events is very close. Now, for history, if not for the Twitterverse, this is compelling. Let's think of it like this. I've been told I can't walk past this point here, so I'll use this point here. Alexander the Great, whom no one doubts, died 323 BC. Our first biographical account of his life is Polybius, 120 years after he's dead. Still, we regard it as a decent source. The best source for Alexander, by the way—this is just for free this morning—is by Arian, his Anabasis. That was written 400 years—I'd keep walking, but I'd go off camera for the people watching elsewhere, right? It's way over there, 400 years after. Okay, let's go right near Jesus. Emperor Tiberius. Heard of him? He's the emperor who ruled when Jesus lived, so it's a really good comparison. He dies in 37, just a few years after Jesus. Our very best biographical account of his life is from Tacitus, who wrote 80 years after Tiberius is dead. Okay, so how do the sources about Jesus compare? I hear you ask. Thank you. Jesus dies around the year 30. It could be 33, but let's just say 30 for convenience. We have at least three sources within 20 years. All of the New Testament sources, all seven, within 60. In other words, the latest New Testament source is closer in time to Jesus than our very best source is for the emperor of the same period. This doesn't prove Christianity, but I tell you, it's a reason historians take the life of Jesus, these Gospels, more seriously than many imagine. Let me quote the biggest-selling secular historian in the world today. His name is Tom Holland, not to be confused with Spider-Man. He's written many, many books about Greek and Roman and Islamic and Persian history, but he very recently, just a month ago, on his Rest His History podcast, made this statement. He's not a Christian. I think there might be lots of reasons one might choose not to believe in God, and specifically the Christian God, but I would say the inadequacy of the New Testament as a source would not be one reason. I am impressed by how much evidence there is for Jesus. There's a third aspect of the solidness of Luke's message. It's very different from those first two, the plainly historical ones. My third reason, and final reason, is that Luke's account of Jesus, indeed the whole New Testament, offers a unique history from below, not from above. Almost all ancient sources are elite sources. They are sources written by the winners, the wealthy, the victors. Virgil, Tacitus, Arian, Josephus, Pliny, Suetonius, all the gang, they're elites. Historians have a level of discomfort in reading elite sources because we're always worrying that we're hearing just a tiny minority of the population, of the voice of the time, and more than that, maybe the sources are themselves an act of power, an act of keeping the status quo. But that cannot apply to the New Testament. It can't. Luke already indicates this in words that are often just overlooked in verse 3, where he says, It seemed good also to me, having followed all things closely from some time past now, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, that you may have certainty concerning the things you have been taught. Theophilus, we don't know for sure, but he is likely a local official of some status who is interested in Christianity and to whom Luke dedicates the volume. But the key is, Luke speaks up to him in the language of status. Most excellent is typical status language. When you are below someone, you say, most excellent. Luke doesn't share the status. Now Luke is no dummy. His Greek is pretty good. First year students at seminary who think they're really good after year one because they started on John's gospel. In year two, they're introduced to Luke's gospel and they think, oh my goodness, did I learn Greek last year or not? It's pretty good Greek, but it's common Greek. It's coiny Greek. It's not the Greek even that you'd find in Josephus or Plutarch. It's the Greek you'd find in the marketplace. The New Testament raises none of the suspicions we have about power. The language is non-elite. All the manuscripts we have before about the fifth century are non-elite copyists. Really ugly handwriting, the earliest manuscripts. And all the key figures in the New Testament are non-elites. I interviewed Teresa Morgan, one of the world's leading historians of this period. She is professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Oxford, although I think now Yale just pinched her, so you win again. And she made just a sidebar comment from a historian's point of view of the value of the New Testament as a history from below. Listen to this grab. So this really is the community literature of very ordinary people. And as such, it's actually a priceless, I mean, aside from its religious value, it's a priceless document in social history of the lives of a community of really pretty ordinary people in the early Roman Empire, of a kind that we have almost no parallel for. I mean, it's a very rare corpus of documents just for a social historian. I know the church has at different times been a bully. And today, sometimes the church is known for grasping at power, and some of you bear the wounds of that. But the texts themselves are history from below. And what is true of the texts is true of the story it tells, actually, because you turn the page in Luke's gospel. And the birth of this Jesus is humble. He's laid in a manger, which is not a special bed reserved for the Son of God. It's the animal feeding area. You keep turning the page, and you come to that passage Ryan mentioned at the outset about this kingdom being for little children, and that if you want to know this kingdom, you've got to be like a little child. And then you keep walking through Luke's gospel, and this one winds and dines with the sinners and the outcasts, and you keep turning through this gospel, and you get to him on a cross, where he said he was willingly giving himself for the wrongs of the world. The night before, he had said, this is my blood, shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. The whole narrative is from below. It's not a bully. So in a way, what I'm saying is Christianity is simultaneously solid and soft. It's solid in the sense that you can come with all of your skeptical muscles fully flexed and take a good hit at it, and it'll just be smiling sweetly back at you. But it's soft as well, in that this is not a truth that is out to conquer you. Jesus said, I've come to serve, give my life as a ransom. It's soft. One of the strangest and most delightful friendships of my life when I was a minister was with this elderly woman, Marie Rose Graber. She was a French atheist. And those of you who know the history of atheism, you know that the French do it really well. And when I met her, she had been a long-term academic at Sydney University, but she went to university in Paris, one of the top universities in the world, where during her undergraduate days in the 50s, she had read all of the philosophers, all of the atheist philosophers, in the three languages in which she was fluent. Of course, Descartes, Nietzsche, David Hume. So she's very skeptical. And the French, as I say, do this really well. But when she came to Australia, she maintained her atheism all the way through her university days. And then after retirement, she met a friend of mine that happened to be a member of my church, who got talking about Christianity. And Marie did her typical lovely French snobbish dismissal of the faith. And he said, oh, well, would you read a book? And she said, I have read all sorts of books. Well, will you read this? And he gave her a little book. And she read it. And she said to him, I will have another book. He got her another one. She said, I will come to your church. And that's when I met her, because I was on deck that day. And I saw her. I went up to her. She's very skeptical. And so began years of beautiful conversation and meals at my home and emails back and forward at night as she wrestled with the Christian faith. And I'll never forget one day she sent me an email where she admitted she was beginning, having read the Gospels over and over and over, she was beginning to feel drawn. Listen to what she wrote to me. Dear Buff and John, Buff, my wife, I find it incredible that walking on the dusty roads of Palestine under the hot sun with a bunch of uneducated people, so snobbish, should give me such pleasure and make me look at life so differently. In my life, I have read avidly all sorts of books. And I never thought that the Gospels would stimulate thus my brain and give me at the same time the feeling that I had arrived at the most important discovery, to the only worthwhile discovery of my life. I love to you all, Marie. That was June. We continued conversation. She read basically a degree in history and theology over the next year. In October the following year, she wrote to me of her overwhelming sense of forgiveness from God through Jesus. Is what she wrote on the 10th of October. Dear John and Buff, it is a miracle for me to learn that God has given me, forgiven me all my past sins. What joy I experienced. And yet, when I observed that I was indulging in the same things again and again, I had moments of doubt. Would God continue to forgive me? But then, by praying, telling God I was sorry, the joy came back. It was as if God had forgiven me my past and present and perhaps even my future sins. This is probably not orthodox, but somehow I still believe it. Much love to you all, Marie. I wrote straight back and said, no, no, no, no. That is orthodox. That's what we teach. Jesus died for all your present, your past, and your future sins. So you are completely forgiven. Marie had two and a half years of full joy knowing Christ's forgiveness. She had massive intellectual questions, which she met with her great mind. But she also had moral questions about the Christian faith. The French are very suspicious of elite power, and she was suspicious of the church. But she came to discover, in Christianity, something solid and something soft. Something that satisfied the intellect, but reassured her soul that God himself, however his people have acted, God himself is not a bully. He loves us. He entered the world for us. He gave himself for us. Rose again for us. That we might find something solid and soft. Will you pray with me? Our Father, will you help us all, whether believers or doubters today, to have a fresh glimpse into ourselves, perhaps, and the nature of our own doubts. But above all, into your word, its trustworthiness, its solidness, and yet, its softness. Help each one of us, Lord, perhaps especially those who aren't sure what to make of Christianity. Give them a sense, a fresh vision of Jesus Christ, his power and humility, his holiness and his kindness, above all, his death and resurrection for us. Lord, lead us all into this knowledge, we pray, in the name of Jesus, amen.
