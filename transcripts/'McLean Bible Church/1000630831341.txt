All right, let me see y'all until what's going on how you doing this morning good. All right You got a Bible with you go to turn to James chapter 1 James chapter 1 we're gonna start at verse 19 and move through verse 25 James chapter 1 we're in the middle of a series titled the beauty of faith and One point about that that I want to make this morning. It's that faith in Jesus Jesus should actually produce a beauty in the world Faith in Jesus should actually produce Beauty in the world because the scriptures tell us that when we're transformed By the Spirit of God by believing in the gospel of Jesus Christ What happens is we're transformed into a people who exhibit the character of Jesus Christ Or what the scriptures call the fruit of the Holy Spirit So as you were being changed more to the image of Christ What should be happening is that you're being transformed into a person characterized by love and joy peace patience kindness goodness gentleness faithfulness and self-control And one of my thoughts even as I was looking at the news yesterday is this what would happen if Christians all around the world? Exhibited those qualities Or what happened if Christians all around the world if we exhibited love in a world that feels like it's so characterized by hate And we as Christians that If we would exhibit joy in a world that seems to be characterized by so much discontentment And in the world so characterized by wars and rumors of wars what what would happen if we were a community that exhibited peace Well, let me tell you what would happen I Think that the world will appear into the church and while they might not Immediately trust and believe in Jesus Christ because there needs to be a message coupled with our actions I believe that it would give Jesus a hearing because of the kind of community that happens within the local church And that's my prayer for NBC Arlington that your faith Will produce beauty will put beauty into the world And so I know for many of you guys It may be hard for you to believe that faith produces beauty because like listen We're so used to people claiming the name of Jesus Christ, and it seems like their lives are characterized by ugliness. I Don't have to pop point too far from this church building to point you towards people who seems like they evoke the name of Jesus Christ in order to gain power Or to gain prestige or to gain wealth But when you see that happen, I always have to remind people those who claim Jesus that doesn't mean that they know Jesus And so my prayer for us today is this there will be a people that exhibit the beauty of faith And so with that said I want us to read a test this morning. This test helps us describe describes for us What does it mean to actually follow Jesus? And so let's do this out of respect for the Word of God this morning. Let's stand if you're able And I'm gonna read the Word of God this morning. So James 1 19 to 25 here it is It says know this my beloved brothers and sisters Let every person be quick to hear slow to speak and slow to anger For the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God Therefore put away all fifth in this and rampant wickedness and receive with meekness the applanted word Which is able to save your souls, but be doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving yourselves For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer He is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he's what he was like But the one who looks it to the perfect law The law of Liberty and perseveres being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts he will be blessed in his doing And this is the Word of God you guys go to take a seat Let's take a moment, let's pray together Father we need you What your word describes in this text we can absolutely not do on our own Father we are people who are quick to speak Slow to listen and quick to anger Father I pray that you'll do the transformative work on our heart father that we would not simply be influenced by the world and the chaos around us But we will understand and know in the depths of our souls That you are with us and because of that We can be transformed you can change us So father help us to hear your word this morning help us to respond to it in the way that we should in faith and obedience I pray these things in the name of Jesus if you agree say Amen, amen. All right. Hey guys, I don't know if you ever paid attention to how people sit, right? I constantly hear how body posture can tell us a lot of things about a person I don't know how much this is true But people often say that if someone sits with cross arms, that means that they're trying to hide something or they're being defensive If somebody sits with cross legs that likely means that that means that they're trying to hide something Now listen, I'm not saying this is 100% I'm not telling you guys to look around the room and look at people's body language and try to observe their character I'm not telling you to go home and look at your roommate and Try to read their bodies. It's not a hundred percent But I do think body posture can tell us a couple of things. I Was thinking about this and I was thinking about my grandmother and my grandmother lived a hard life She was a sharecropper in North Carolina. She lived her whole life bent over in fields. I'm harvesting things Grandma was bent over her whole life. What was amazing about my grandmother is that despite that she had perfect posture What was amazing about grandmother is that man? She sat up straight. She looked regal Like I guarantee you if there was something about the posture Olympics and you put my grandmother and the Queen of England side-by-side Queen of England is coming in second because my grandmother her posture could not be matched, right? She was amazing And yet as my grandmother got older arthritis began to set in and my grandmother didn't sit as tall as she did before The pain often became unbearable grandma start to hunch over a little bit and her body posture told me this That pain can shift posture Pain can shift posture And this isn't just the case physically. This is also the case in our relationships If you live life long enough, you've seen what I've seen and I've seen pain shift posture that people have towards one another I've seen pain take friends and loved ones and turn them into enemies I've seen grief and loss take marriages and turn people who once loved one another into perfect strangers I've seen people going through pain pushing the people that love them away I've seen anger and vitriol replace what where once aware love what stood Pain can shift posture and this is also the case in our relationship with God what I love about the book of James is that James is to have brother of Jesus Christ and he's right into a people who Are experiencing the pain of a trial and the trouble of temptation And he helps them understand if they're not careful their temptations and their trials can shift their heart posture Towards God and each other and my prayer for you this morning is this is that you'll consider your posture this morning If you know me if you've been around me for a while, you know, that's about me. I have horrible posture and The fact of the matter is that was not due to my mother's influence. My mom's trying her hardest She made me read books on etiquette when I was a teenager Every time I would sit down with my mother. She will always say sit up son and When she said that that helped me understand two things one I had slipped into improper posture and two I needed to fix it And today I pray as I preach this sermon I pray that that my voice will be something like my mother's was to me that you'll consider your posture to other people and to God this morning and That this clarion call from the Word of God will be what you need by the power of the Spirit to fix your posture All right. So what is a healthy posture first? What does it look like towards one another? Well, let's look at the scriptures. Look at the passage. Let me give you this What is the healthy posture looks like it's a posture where we are slow with our words And I'll even add we're also slow with our anger Look at verse 19. It says know this my beloved brothers Let every person be quick to listen slow to speak slow to get angry All of this to say a healthy posture towards each other is where we are slow with our words and with our anger Let me give you some context here The very first verse James says in the first chapter James says that he's writing to a group of Christians Who are of the dispersion meaning that these Christians are far away from home Because the persecution in Jerusalem these Christians have been spread out all over the Empire It's a painful trial. It's hard to be away from home. They're hurting But then also as well, he's right into an incredibly diverse group of people, especially socio-economically So when you look at chapter 1 verses 9 through 10 James is right into two groups at least two groups of people in the church he's right into those who are rich and also those who are poor and Then this is amazing because in Roman society Within where most of the New Testament was written There were only two classes of people the rich and the poor and these two groups rarely interacted with one another There was a wide gap of disparity between the two There was no middle-class in Roman society and there were no places where the rich and poor actually meaningfully Interacted with one another they didn't socialize with one another they didn't go to the same places And it's been time with each other and in this letter James said James is addressing these people who are rich and poor who have found commonality in Jesus Christ The local church during that time was the only place in Roman society The local church during that time was the only place in Roman society where two people who've been rescued by Jesus Christ the rich and the poor actually meaningfully Interacted with one another they became um completely complete strangers and they were joined together within family And because these people never had interactions with one another even though they're family we all know with our physical family sometimes The differences are awkward to navigate And they needed to hear this loud and clear That the pain of their dispersion did not give them an excuse to close their ears to their neighbors They needed to hear that their frustration with the differences with their neighbors Who are different than them is not an excuse for them to lash out in anger Here's the thing pain does not have to shift your posture towards other people This is what james is trying to get at and we need to hear this, too Because there may not be a bigger witness that the church of Jesus Christ can have in this moment In this city that are filled with hurting people there for us to become a people who are Quick to listen slow to speak and slow to get angry God we know this listen when I turn on my tv to c-span all I hear is people who are quick to talk And quick to anger And I get it listen man c-span may be low-hanging fruit this morning It's easy for us to look at capitol hill and say man. These people are crazy. They need to read james one But listen the purpose of what i'm saying today is this it's not for you to think about somebody else That's the epitome of pride for you to sit under a sermon and think yo, so and so needs to hear this Yo, I want this word to come right to you on your front doorstep and for you to consider are you Quick to listen slow to speak and slow to get angry Let me give you a definition of anger really quickly This is what anger is Anger is an active displeasure towards a threat to something that we love Anger is an active displeasure towards a threat to something that we love. I think this is a good definition But here's the issue with our anger If anger is an active displeasure towards a threat to something that we love The bible tells us a little bit about the stuff that we love. Here's the thing The issue is this we actually love the wrong things We love the wrong things because of our sin against god We don't love the things that we should love In our lives what we end up doing is we love the things that we should love a lot We actually love those a little And the things that we should love very very little we love a whole lot So I think about my own life listen instead of loving to listen I often love being right Instead of loving god I often I often love myself more Instead of loving to serve my neighbor I often love my own comfort instead and hear me this morning If anger is an active displeasure towards a threat to something that we love and if we love ourselves more than anything This means this that our anger is often selfish and is often misguided And if our anger is selfish often and misguided often, you know what that means. We should be slow to anger We should be slow to anger Listen in your personal relationships Guys, you should be quick to listen slow to speak slow to get angry When we're talking about even our political conventions We should be quick to listen slow to speak slow to get angry When people are around you and you don't get them and you're so different and you simply want to convince them to your point Of view you also need to be quick to listen slow to speak slow to get angry And I guess let me let me say what you might be thinking at this moment many of us are too quick to dismiss this clear command in the bible because we Automatically think about the most outlandish thing that somebody could say We think about the craziest thing that someone can say and we say clearly god isn't telling me that I need to entertain what they're saying Guys, we all know this people say some off the wall stuff Man I even hesitate to call this church a church But there's a church out there. They're called westborough baptist church. I know many of you guys have heard of them And I don't know if they still do this but in the past they used to show up to random funerals like Funerals of service members who had died in combat and others And they would hold these signs outside of the funeral and I remember one of the signs that I saw them hold it and said Thank god for dead soldiers It's crazy like I said before everybody who claims to be following jesus is not following him And I don't think this verse would be calling people who are mourning a lost loved one To step out of the processional to walk up to the person holding that sign Saying well god told me to be quick to listen slow to speak slow to get angry So I want to listen to you. Like how did you get to that point of view? I don't think god is calling us to do simply that I don't think that Guys people could say some wild and evil hateful things and this verse is not saying that you get need to give everyone an equal hearing So The same bible that has in james 1 19 everyone be quick to listen slow to speak slow to get angry It also says in ecclesiastes 7 it says do not take heart all the things that people say Lest you hear your servant cursing you So your question should be what is it? Should I be quick to listen slow to speak slow to get angry? Or should I not take heart to all the things that people say let me give you the answer. Yes Yes Yes Remember james off is often called the proverbs of the new testament and wisdom Like proverbs and james gives is often it is it's situational right There are going to be situations Hear me for a number of reasons Where you don't want to be quick to listen slow to speak slow to get angry But that's what's best for you and you need to do it And there's going to be other situations where it's going to be best for you to remove yourself And so all that to say I don't want you to when it comes to this commandment I don't want you to think about the craziest thing that somebody can say right now and to think oh that gives me a reason That gives me a reason to not do this Right. Don't think about the crazy things that people can say because here's the thing no matter what they say your default posture Your first movement should always be I need to be quick to listen slow to speak slow to get angry Why is that it says in verse 20? It says for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of god The anger of man does not produce the righteousness of god and here's the thing you you might be tempted to read that verse and to think Well that verse is saying that all anger is wrong But that's not true This passage qualifies anger It says the anger of who? The anger of man, right Listen, that's because of this our anger tends to be lightning quick It tends to be reactive It tends to be used simply because we feel slighted or wronged and our anger is typically used to protect our idols I'll just use me as an example I get angry when people slide drive so slow in this city And why is that because i'm impatient And they're slow driving feels like it's threatening my idol of control I'll keep going about me. I can easily get anger and angry at my kids And it's not because i'm mad because their anger is hurting them i'm mad especially out in public Because their behavior is a reflection on me. I feel And why is that because I idolize my reputation and clearly they don't idolize my reputation I get angry at being inconvenienced rather than injustice In the world and this selfish anger can grip us without even thinking is so quick and this is the anger of man However, let me tell you something about god God has it. God the anger of god is actually a good anger. His anger is slow It's informed and it's always right And if we are believers in jesus christ, and we're going to be and we're being transformed into his image We should be a people that imitate him Let me give you a few verses in the bible that describe the anger of god. Here's one. Exodus 34 6 Numbers 14 18 The lord is slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love forgiving iniquity and transgression But he will by no means clear the guilty Visiting the iniquity of the fathers of the children to the third and fourth generation Nehemiah 9 7 8 The lord is slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love forgiving iniquity and transgression But he will by no means clear the guilty Visiting the iniquity of the fathers of the children to the third and fourth generation Nehemiah 9 17. You are a god ready to forgive gracious and merciful What slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and he did not forsake them I'm gonna keep driving this home psalm 86 15, but you oh lord are a god merciful and gracious slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness one of the Favorite ways that god this one is one of his favorite ways to describe himself is the fact that he's slow to anger God's default posture towards us is that he's slow to anger Abounding in steadfast love and I love this because we would not be saved today if god wasn't slow to anger We would not Y'all we should have been wiped out a long time ago And yet god was slow to anger abounding the steadfast love my sin deserved his immediate wrath And yet on the cross jesus showed mercy to me And if you are a believer in jesus christ, I should fill your heart with joy this morning because he did the same for you He did If you were a follower of jesus christ, he did the same for you. And if jesus was slow to anger with us We need to be slow to anger with each other We're called to imitate him So my next question is this how do you know if you proceed? How do you know? That you are quick to listen slow to speak slow to get angry. How do you know you're growing in this? How do we become this way? Here's the next point I want to give you You are able to form a posture towards other people in which you are quick to listen slow to speak and slow to get angry When you have a certain posture towards god's word So here's the point we actually we need to be open to god's word We see this actually in verse 21 Verse 21 it says therefore put away all filthiness and rampant wickedness and receive with meekness the implanted word Which is able to save your souls. Let me tell you what james is saying here and i'll give you some context James pretty much is saying hey, listen believers in christ keep the same energy now that you had when you first believed in jesus christ So, um and james 1 uh 18 James talks about how those believers that he's writing to how they first believed in jesus christ And he says that they were brought forth by the word of god and simply what that means is that when when when these believers Heard what the word of god said about jesus that jesus is lord and savior. How did they respond to it? They received it humbly They trusted in it they said listen Jesus isn't just lord and savior He needs to be lord and savior to me and for me to become into right relationship with jesus I need to repent and trust in him. They received the word about jesus with meekness And in verse 21, he's saying keep that same energy He said just like you received it then even in the face of trials you need to receive it now But I want to focus on that word meekness because that word meekness is incredibly important It's a hard word to define. So let me take a moment to define it try to define it for you So we'll give it a shot. This is what meekness is I believe Me this is this It's an attitude or quality of heart Whereby a person willingly accepts and submits without resistance to the will and desire of someone else It's an attitude or quality of heart whereby a person Willingly accepts and submits without resistance to the will and desire of someone else So when we receive the word of god with meekness it's saying god i'm no longer trusting my heart I'm not longer trusting what other people say i'm not trusting what I think should happen god i'm gonna I'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna trust your will I'm gonna trust your words and your question might be okay cool eric How does that relate to being quick to listen slow to speak slow to answer? The only way that we're able to have a posture Always in which we are slow with our words is when we have a posture of faith towards god's word The only way that we're able to be slow with our words is when we are able when we are able to submit to and accept god's word I'll give you an example to kind of drive this home. I think about my mother my mother was a Growing up and she was so nice that they made it problematic when she would discipline us Right when mom was home alone my me and my younger brother. We were at the fool We were not scared of my mom's discipline and she would be stressing herself out Trying to discipline us And then inevitably in the discussion after she had stressed herself out My mom would look at us and she would say the the words that would come out of her mouth And she would say the words that would come out of her mouth My mom would look at us and she would say the the words that would shift the entire conversation She would look at us and she would say, okay, cool. Wait till your dad gets home And then after that mom would be calm like she would be chilling We'd be still doing what we were doing. She said, okay, cool I ain't even worried about it. Keep going. Keep going like wait till your mom gets home. I'm gonna wait till your dad gets home Like why was she so quiet and calm after she said that Well, let me tell you She knew that she didn't have to use her words anymore to try to control us because she knew that my dad had the final word She knew that he was coming home and that he would have the final word. Listen mbc arlington To receive god's word with meekness is to believe that god has the final word Y'all we can rest Because our because his word has more power and authority that our puny words have Let me ask you this could it be could it be Could it be the case that we are so quick with our words? Because we don't trust the power of god's word Y'all we often use our words and our anger to try to control people Like our words and our anger are often used to try to control people and then we try to use our words and our anger We when we can't control people People and this often reveals that we really don't believe god's word when he says that he's in control Y'all we use our words to often be defensive and defend ourselves And we don't and I think that reveals that we don't believe his final word about us That we don't need to justify ourselves because he justifies us So Y'all we often use our words to hurt people who hurt us and we really don't believe god's final word when he says Vengeance is mine. I'll I will repay Y'all listen meekness is saying god I can trust that your words are much more powerful than mine and so i'm going to receive them And I think about this I think about one of one of my uh, one of my heroes honestly It's a woman by the name of fannie lou hamer I don't know if you know who fannie lou hamer is but fannie lou hamer was a civil rights activist She was an incredible orator And one of the main things that she did is she organized african-americans to vote in jim crow south And she went through so much pain and injustice There was one time when she was arrested for doing what she did and she was tossed in prison And it was a night from hell and in the prison. She was sexually assaulted by one of the police officers who rescued her And when she was released, I know i'm sure any of us would be completely We would completely understand if she went off and berserk on the police officer that did that to her But when she was released She walked up to that police officer and she calmly said this She said have you ever wondered what you are going to say? Would you stand before god and you have to get to account for what you did to me? That's what she said And many of us we look at that and we say how in the world was she able to say that The only reason she was able to say that It's because she understood that god's word is the final word That's how she was able to do that. Listen It doesn't mean that we don't turn a blind eye towards the evil in the world But it does mean this That you can have peace even in the midst of what's wrong Even in the midst of what's wrong in the world because there's a god in heaven who has the final word and we could receive His word with meekness my question for you today is this do you know that? Do you know that god has the final word? Let me tell you if you knew that god has the final word, you know One thing that you wouldn't do you want to gossip about people? You want to talk about people around their backs? You will be careful about what you say about other people because here's the thing you're not sovereign You don't know everything god does and he has to find a word about them. Not you How dare you go around Affecting and changing people's opinions about other people. You don't got the final word about them God does Listen, god's word is a gift And our posture should be to receive the word of god with meekness And so my question this morning along with this is like, okay cool eric receive the word of god with venus Like what will happen if I actually assume this posture Like like how do I know i'm actually doing this? What will it produce? Where's my last point? When you assume a posture of meekness towards god's word the effect of that is you actually do the word You actually do it you're not a hero of the word you actually do it you become a doer of god's word It's what verses 22 to 25 say this is what it says it says but be doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving yourselves For if anyone is a hero of the word and not a doer. He's like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror For he looks at himself and goes away, but at once forgets what he was like But the one who listened to the perfect law the law of liberty and perseveres Be a no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts No hearer who forgets but a doer who acts He will be blessed in his doing So so listen guys what's interesting about this test is that this test You see two different kinds of people two different postures towards the word of god You see this word it says that god's word is like a mirror showing us who we actually are and in verse 22 to 23 We see a person confronted with god's word They see themselves for who they really are And one thing that we're all tempted to do and I love how this first point is out Is that we are tempted to make allowances for ourselves and excuse our behavior We're tempted to make excuses for the things that the bible reveals So we'll say man, I yelled at that person But god they deserved it Yo, I I talked negatively about that person but yo, it wasn't gossip I was just sharing a concern Listen what I love about god's word is that god's word allows us to see our lives and our behavior for what it is And we're not always going to like what we see And because of that we can either have two postures There are two postures that we can have an approach to god's word when you look at verses 22 to 24 Look at the first person This person is confronted with all the filthiness And the rampant wickedness that verse 21 describes and they do nothing about it Verse 23 it says this person is given an opportunity To look into the mirror of god's word and god's word reveals back to them the ugliness of what they see the pride The lust the greed or the anger the word shows them that and then in verse 24 this person turns away And refuses to do anything about it And y'all this isn't the kind of forgetfulness like I left my keys at the house This is a willful forgetfulness This is the kind of forgetfulness that a person has when when when someone's life is not going well And they want to forget about it. And so they just down like a a couple of beers to forget about their problems It's a willful ignorance and listen this person sees what the word of god reveals Refuses to deal with it and let me tell you guys there's a danger in being this kind of person There's a danger of being this kind of person Listen the more that you Intentionally forget god's word the more that you get in the practice of hearing god's word and not doing it And if you do that, you're in a dangerous position Y'all it is dangerous to open our bibles each morning and practice selective hearing It's dangerous to come to church each week and allow our pain to have veto power over whether or not we'll listen to god's word Many of us allow our pain to have veto power over whether or not we obey god Man, i'm about to give a political analogy and I know people work on the hill right now So don't send me emails say eric. That's exactly that's not really how it works. But no Hang with me. So our president has veto power, right? I'm, right, right veto power. Okay. Thank you All right And so when a bill called crosses our president's desk our president has an option He can either sign a bill after he signs the bill that becomes a law It becomes a law Or what he can do is he can say no i'm not signing that I don't like it He can send it back to congress, right? I'm right so far, right? I love it. All right And so like in this instance, the president has veto power he can decide whether or not something that a proposal becomes a law Here's the issue In our lives, we should read god's commands like a proposal and then we run it past our pain We think about it and we say you know what god's telling me to do something but uh, it's going to be painful if I do that God's telling me to do something but it's gonna be really hard if I do that And what we do is we allow our pain to have veto power and listen, that is not the way that we should approach god's word His word calls the shots And when you do that When you give your pain veto power your heart becomes callous to the to the word of god So what is god telling you to do today Go do it I want you to take the posture of the man in verse 25 Verse 25 it says this it says but the one who looks into the perfect law the law of liberty and perseveres Be a no hero who forgets but a doer who acts he would be blessed in his doing Uh josh, you can go ahead and come back up man I love that last line. It says that the person who does the word of god would be blessed in his doing Would be blessed in his doing y'all hear me this morning y'all there's a blessing That's a blessing in doing god's word and not just hearing it That's an incredible blessing this morning. Like hear me hear me today guys You will always regret disobedience Y'all disobedience may feel good for a moment It may feel good for a moment, but I guarantee you guys that moment is going to fade There's incredible blessing and obedience in the end The internal blessing of of obedience will always be better than the short-lived blessing of disobedience There is blessing and obedience. But but let me tell you this morning. Where do you get the strength to get the blessing? Where do you get the strength to actually do the word of god because here's the thing every single day we mess up Every single day we need to go to god with repentance and ask him for fresh strength Where do we get the the strength and the energy to receive the blessing that this test describes To obey the perfect law the law that gives liberty We get it from jesus christ What I love about this is this Is that we can receive blessing in the doing of god's word? Because jesus christ was cursed in his doing of god's word So you're thinking eric, what are you talking about think about our savior jesus Our savior jesus came to earth because of our sin and he perfectly obeyed his father He received his father's words with meekness. There was never a time in which jesus disobeyed the words of his father I think about even in the garden of gethsemane. He was sweating drops of blood And there was likely and and if we were in that position we would have gave our pain veto power It's too much to bear But jesus in that garden even with the agony that he knew was ahead of him. He said god not my will but yours be done Jesus did that he perfectly obeyed his father and because of that he deserved a blessing And yet instead of receiving the blessing, you know what happened to jesus. He was cursed The old testament describes cursed as anyone who hangs on a tree And that's exactly what jesus did because of our sin Jesus christ died on the cross bearing the sins of the world He was cursed And yet three days later jesus christ rose again in power Proving that he's victorious over sin and death in the grave and he was cursed why for your blessing Giving us an opportunity any of us who would confess our sin and trusting jesus's lord. We could be forgiving have eternal life And now we have the power to obey the word of god not in our own strength Mbc arlington you have the spirit of god dwelling in you You have the power to obey Let's go do it by the strength that god provides Let's take a moment to pray together Father we love you And the only reason we love you is because you first loved us So father, I pray That you will give us the strength and the power to do what you are calling us today You said in your word for us to be quick to listen slow to speak And slow to get angry God, we can't do that on our own We love to be heard But father I pray that we'll be a people that listen and hear your words that we bow at your feet We understand that you have the final word And we pray that by the spirit of god that you will give us what we need To do what you've called us to do Father in this room today god, we've shared words with people in anger. I pray that you'll give us the power to go to them and to repent Father for many of us god, we we don't listen to people We have friends and loved ones they don't feel heard by us Father I pray that you give us the power to go to the people that we love and to ask them How can I be a better listener to you?
