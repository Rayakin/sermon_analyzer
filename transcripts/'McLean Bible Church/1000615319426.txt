We got the kids in the room and teenagers today So we're excited to have you guys. Yep, we can give it up for them And just want to remind our extended church family today is not a day where we take a break from kids quest We take a break from the rock in regards to yes Programming is closed, but we don't take a break from discipling younger members of our church family All right So as the kids join us today as we sing as we pray as we study God's Word as we take from communion together Those are ways that we have the opportunity and great privilege to disciple kids and actually church family That's an alignment with God's Word. So you might remember a couple months ago when we were still in the book of Mark We studied the just the importance of the whole church coming around the next generation and the importance of us being Faithfully living out God's biblical mandate for us to raise up young people in the ways of the Lord. So, please The although for some of you this might feel like a little bit of an inconvenience. I want to remind you it is not We are obeying God today by having all of our family members. Amen all right, and if our parents if you got like a younger child like an infant or a toddler that Needs a diaper change or needs to be soothed because they're having a little bit of a hard time There is a room in the nursery that's open and available if you want to walk in there and and take care of your kid So this morning we're to spend time in Mark chapter 12 verse 35 through 40 So you can go ahead and turn there. You got a Bible on you We'll have verses on the screen and kids This is a great time to not only take out your Bibles But it's also a great time to take out your activity sheets And so you can color on those or you can doodle as you're listening to the message And if you've been following our sermon series in the book of Mark, I know it's felt like it but we've been in Mark chapter 12 for a long time and We got this text today and we got one more text in Mark 12 next Sunday But as we've studied Mark 12 There's been a series of questions coming Jesus's way and in last week's text Jesus actually silenced these religious leaders that question him over and over again by Quoting the greatest commandment of all time to love God with everything that we are and to love people as we love ourselves And so all for the purpose as pastor David shared of experiencing our highest good and greatest joy in Christ and the silence of this crowd leads Jesus to ask a very important question and also issue a Serious warning and as I studied the text of this week, I landed on this point to summarize it for us So here's our bottom line and it's this Submitting to Jesus should change the way you live All right submitting to Jesus should change the way you live somebody say live And I want to show you how we see this in a text this morning. So let's go ahead and read verse 35 Through 40 and it says while Jesus was teaching in the temple He asked how can the scribes say that the Messiah is the Son of David? David himself says by the Holy Spirit The Lord declared to my Lord sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet David himself calls him Lord Then how can he be his son and the large crowd was listening to him with delight in verse 38? He also said in his teaching beware of the scribes Who wants to go around in long robes and who want greetings in the marketplaces? The best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets They devour widows houses and say long prayers just for show these will receive harsher judgment So back to verse 35 While Jesus was teaching in the temple, he asked how can the scribes say that the Messiah is the Son of David? so Jesus asked a thought-provoking question kind of like when teachers ask you a hard question at school kids and To understand what Jesus is saying here. We have to understand What what is the word Messiah what that means and who is David? So the word Messiah comes from a Hebrew word that means anointed one or chosen one In biblical times an anointed person meant that they were set apart for a specific role with a God-ordained purpose So in the Old Testament, it was predicted that a deliverer chosen by God himself Would save the nation of Israel and the Jews would refer to this deliverer as their Messiah And in the New Testament of the Bible the book of John ends by by stating that its purpose was for it being written was so that readers would know and Believe that Jesus Christ is the Messiah and in Matthew chapter 16 Peter one of the followers of Jesus affirms that Jesus was the Messiah and The ultimate evidence of Jesus being the Messiah was confirmed when he resurrected from the grave so Jesus Was the chosen one? From God with a God-ordained purpose of saving humanity from their sin So kids think about a hero. All right, maybe when you think of a hero kids you think about rocket All right, you think of rockets saving the galaxy. We got a picture here Or maybe you think about Super Mario saving princess Peach Peach you're so cool Y'all know the song Or maybe you might even think to our younger ones you think of JJ all right, so JJ from Cocoa melon and I gotta be honest JJ's my hero right now because every time my my little baby girl is crying JJ sues her. All right. There's a reason why she's in the room with the with the mirrors because that girl be tripping. All right But in all seriousness this weekend is a reminder of who the real who of who the real heroes are We got a picture of these real heroes By this Memorial Day weekend I'm utterly grateful for the veterans who have sacrificed their lives for the safety and freedom of our country And if you're a member of the United States military My heart just goes out to you and I thank you this morning for your service And I pray God's blessing and favor upon you and your families as you guys faithfully serve our country And I also pray that God will comfort you as some of you mourn the loss of your brothers and sisters in arms today Now back to the text the people of Israel waited on their hero But they didn't quite realize at the time that this hero was would be Jesus So what's the connection between the Messiah and David? Well, David is one of the former kings of Israel who ruled during the golden era of Israel You might remember David is a young Shepherd boy that fought off lions and bears and even slayed a giant named Goliath that threatened the people of Israel and under his reign Israel prospered as a nation They won many battles and they sought the Lord But then David after his death his son Solomon ruled with all wisdom and after Solomon's rule he had a lot of wisdom, but After his reign Israel divided into two kingdoms and then the nation began to decay So the people long for a Messiah to come and restore them They envisioned a great king like David that would rescue all Israel from their enemies on earth So the Jews believed and taught that the Messiah would descend from King David from his line Although they didn't know who exactly the Messiah was at the time So following Jesus's question in verse 36 He responds with an answer to his own question He says David himself says by the Holy Spirit the Lord declared to my Lord Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet So here Jesus is quoting from Psalm 110 verse 1 where under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit God confirms through David that the Messiah is coming and Psalm 110 is widely known as a prophetic psalm because the psalmist had declared had received a direct revelation from God But also it's quoted several times in the New Testament in defense of Jesus being the Messiah So in Psalm 110 verse 1 the word LORD in all caps So when you look it up in Psalm 110 the word LORD in all caps refers to the Hebrew word Yahweh, which is referring to God here in Mark chapter 12 and my Lord in lowercase letters is Adonai a Hebrew word that acknowledges a person or Sometimes God as their master and here in particular the second my Lord is referring to Jesus So what David is writing is that God tells Jesus to sit at his right hand Which is the highest place for of honor and authority and here David acknowledges that Jesus is his Lord so Psalm 110 predicts the victory of Jesus over all his enemies as they're placed under his feet which is a sign of position position of power and That and what it was pointing towards is that Jesus would one day declare victory over sin death Satan and all who oppose him Like Jesus was meant to be a hero that would spiritually deliver his people not just physically deliver them So Jesus quoted this to demonstrate that he was not only David's descendant But also his Lord and he is the Messiah the Christ and David's Lord who will sit at God's right hand and receive all the glory So Jesus continues in verse 37 David himself calls him Lord How then can he be his son and the large crowd was listening to him with delight? So Jesus continues to defend his point and in these days typically a son would give honor to his father and not the other way Around so if David called his descendant my Lord, he clearly was more than just David's son He's David's sovereign king to whom he must bow So Jesus used the scriptures to show that the Messiah would indeed be a human descent of David But he would also be far more He would also be divine you see the Bible teaches that Jesus was God in the flesh fully human and fully God and Because Jesus is God and has always been God. He deserves the rightful title as Lord Like 2,000 years ago. He left heaven He became a man and he dwelled on earth and he came to embody and preach God's Word He came to die for the sins of the world and reconcile people to God and he is a resurrected king that sits at the right hand of God to whom God has given all authority in heaven and on earth and The Jewish leaders of Jesus time expected the Messiah to rescue them from the rule of the Romans and establish a kingdom on earth They believed in a Messiah, but had an incomplete understanding of the Messiah So Jesus raised this issue so that the Jewish leaders would comprehend his true identity Which they probably caught but they didn't accept But regardless Jesus was on a mission as God's chosen one as his anointed one to deliver his people Spiritually through his death and his resurrection And he will one day establish his kingdom on earth and reign for all eternity, but it wasn't the time for it yet So as the Jewish leaders aimed to trap Jesus in Mark 12, it only resulted in the crowd listening to him with delight And then verse 38 through 40 It says Jesus also said in his teaching beware of the scribes Who want to go around in long robes and who want greetings in the marketplace? The best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets. They devour widows houses and say long prayers just for show These will receive harsher judgment So as Jesus continues teaching he issues a warning somebody say warning And he says to watch out for the scribes who taught the law and not all of them did this But some of them sought praise from people and abuse of their authority And because the scribes were teachers of God's Word They should have been an example of godliness and humility to the world around them But rather they chase after public honor and public recognition for themselves So teenagers to sum it up. They were thirsty for clout. All right, and adults if you don't know what that means just Google urban dictionary and type in clout All right with the T at the end not a D and but pretty much what it means is these guys wanted people to see Them. All right, so they were thirsty for likes and followers and the blue verified check mark You get on IG when you've made it, you know they went around rocking the best fits for teachers and they loved it when people called them by their formal titles like Master and rabbi and teacher and they enjoyed being in important places we're seated in places where the whole congregation would face them and they would see them and They expected to be honored with special meals whenever and when anyone whenever someone would host them You see during the first century law teachers weren't paid for their services In other words, they weren't paid to do ministry. So they depended upon the hospitality and generosity of devout Jews So according to verse 40 they put on a show to receive benefits To devour widows homes was a figure of speech for exploiting the generosity of people with limited means especially widows so this means that they took advantage of people's kindness and even deceive people into thinking these guys are more holier than mine than I am and They so they saw honor for themselves instead of instead of honoring the God who they profess to serve So kids their leadership style was kind of like Bowser. All right, they were filled with pride and selfish ambition and In some ways we can all relate to this Like we chase after things of this life that will give us higher position power and praise Like in our pride we pursue glory for ourselves rather than seeking to glorify with our God with our lives and in humility serving others and Some of us would do or even risk anything with for more popularity or fame and we're all prone to this We're all prone to pursue this like even leaders in the church Abuse of their congregations for more attention and followers and to fill more money in their PayPal accounts like instead of pointing people to Jesus these individuals were seeking attention for themselves and And in similar ways there's many leaders and pastors that do that by preaching unforgettable sermons or offering flashy entertainment in their services or crafting compelling social media accounts for people to follow them and Jesus reminds us to be aware of those who lead in the church at a selfish ambition and this text Emphasizes the difference between those who serve with hypocrisy and those who serve God with true devotion So Jesus condemns this kind of conduct and greed especially for those who lead his people and God words his word affirms it in James Chapter 3 verse 1 when he says these individuals one day that teach and live like this will receive harsher judgment So if Jesus is Lord of our lives, we shouldn't live this way And I pray that God would guard and protect leaders in this church Including myself and members of this church family to not live like this Like may we live in submission to Jesus as Lord over our lives and in humility Submit to one another put in the interest of others above our own. I Pray we would walk in humility Utterly dependent upon God's spirit to give us the ability to live and love like Jesus did So, how do these five verses apply to our lives today, well here was the bottom line Submitting to Jesus should change the way you live And I'm going to walk us through just three quick questions for you to reflect upon and then at the end of the sermon I want to give you some time to process those questions between You and the Lord. So here's our first question number one Do you believe Jesus is Lord? And do you believe Jesus is Lord somebody say Lord Jesus is God He wasn't just a good teacher Wasn't just a religious leader or a prophet or a God made by human hands or a created being that is lesser than God Despite what other religions might claim the Bible teaches that Jesus is God that he and the Father are one and he is the second person of the Holy Trinity Father Son and Holy Spirit and he is the creator of all things according to John chapter 1 which gives him the rightful title as Lord over all and Jesus isn't only Lord and Messiah for the people of Israel He is the chosen one from God that was sent to this world to fulfill the purpose of saving all people from their sin You see the Bible teaches that all humanity has sinned against the Holy God Which means we rebel against God in his ways and our sin leads to death which separates us from God for all eternity However, God sent Jesus to earth and he became a human living a sinless and perfect life and since he never sinned Jesus was able to pay the penalty for our sin through his death on a cross and He rose again to free us from our sin And the good news for us today is if we believe with our hearts and what Jesus has done for us Confessing our sins before him and trusting him as both Savior and Lord over our lives We can be saved and receive eternal life with him as well You see the long-anticipated Messiah of the Old Testament is the Savior King for the entire human race And he came to save everyone and after he rose again, this is what God did in Philippians 2 verse 9 through 11 It says for this reason God highly exalted him Jesus and gave Jesus the name that is above every name so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth and Every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father So Jesus is our King now and he's already seated at the right hand of God because he is Lord and One day every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that he is Lord And the hope is is he will deliver those who trust him from sin death Suffering for all eternity and he will dwell with us in his kingdom And if you're not a father of Jesus and you're wondering then how can I make this Jesus the Lord of my life? It's simple You cannot make Jesus the Lord of your life he's already Lord and what we are called to do is submit to his Lordship and This means we humbly respond to Jesus as Lord by yielding to his will and authority for our lives And you can do this today By confessing your sin before God and receiving the forgiveness that is offered in Christ and trusting him with your life And when we trust Jesus as Lord It should absolutely change the way we view our lives and the way we view the world around us Which brings us to our second question as a Christian number two Does your life show Jesus is your Lord? Does your life show that Jesus is your Lord somebody say show Like remember the warning Jesus gave of the scribes instead of their lifestyles and platforms pointing people to Jesus it pointed to themselves so if God was really their Lord as they claimed and As they as they as they claimed their achievements and success like it should have been for God's glory. Not their own and In a similar way like does your life show Jesus is your Lord privately? Like do you wake up each day and tell Jesus you're the Lord of my life I submit to you like help me to live in light of your word and obey your commandments today like this is this Jesus Lordship in your life in the privacy of your life leads you to read your word Leads you to talk to God To abide in biblical community to run from sin or to share the gospel with others Like not only does your life show Jesus is your Lord privately, but does your life show that Jesus is your Lord publicly as You engage with others do they see Christ in you Do people feel the love of Jesus from you? Do you give Jesus honor and glory for the things you've achieved in life? Do you use your talents in or job or sport or any platform that God has given you to glorify Jesus? Or where people in your life be shocked that they found out that you were a Christian I These scribes in Mark chapter 12 use religion as a cover-up To live the life they wanted to live and it's very possible for some of us in this room to fall into the same Danger of using religion and using church attendance or our performance in front of others as a cover-up however, since Jesus is Lord we must live for his glory in his glory alone and The psalmist gets her right in Psalm 115 verse 1 when he declares not to us not to us But to your name give glory because of your faithful love and because of your truth So kids and teens you might wonder what does it mean to live for God's glory? And how do I do that with my life? Like it's living in a way that acknowledges the greatness and splendor of God and praising him for it It's living in a way that you where you live for the for the for Jesus to be famous in your life and not your own Fame It's when you give thanks to God Showing appreciation to him because he is the giver of everything that you have It's when you proclaim his greatness because that's who he is It's when you rejoice in him because he is always good It's when you seek the Lord in prayer trusting. He knows what is best for your life It's when you offer your life as a living sacrifice with the aim of shining bright for Jesus's glory And for the good of people around you Now this is why Jesus says in Matthew 5 16 in the same way Let your light shine before others that they may see your good works and give glory to your father in heaven So adult teenager and child in the room. Is this true of you today? Like I think of Megan Danielle a 20 year old waitress and a worship leader from Georgia who recently Made it as top runner-up on American Idol Not only was she known for her powerful voice Musically, but also in in her stage presence But she went viral for being a young girl who was unashamed of her faith in Jesus So in American Idol during that competition She was seeing Christian songs and she didn't shy away from publicly praising and pointing people to Jesus on a national level And after she made it to the top three of American Idol She shared on social media her gratitude and wrote in her caption and I quote. Let's keep sharing the light and love of Jesus Even one of her judges Luke Bryan one of the most famous country singers of all time He said this about her He praised her for her unwavering faith and said and I quote what I love about you is You're never scared to tell everybody about your faith Like Megan used and continues to use her platform for God's glory Showing others and telling others that Jesus is her Lord And her example brings us to our third and final question There's number three Do you tell others Jesus is Lord? Like do you tell others Jesus is Lord Like Megan Danielle, are you vocal about your faith and trust in Jesus? You lovingly share the gospel with your family your friends your co-workers your neighbors Like it's the love of Jesus evident through your words and through your actions Does your character draw people to Jesus or does your character push people away from Jesus? You know some of the scribes and mark use their platform to lead people into an empty religion that did not glorify God However, as we study last Sunday in Mark chapter 12 verse 33 We're called to love God with everything that we are but also to love others as we love ourselves And the best way we can share the love of Jesus is through our words and our actions And we must remember that Jesus isn't only our Lord, but he is Lord of all So people need to know this truth Like every every day millions of people are dying without knowing that Jesus Christ is Lord So what will you do about that? You may not be able to reach the world or go all the way to the nations But God does require of you to faithfully share with those. He has positioned right around you So will you tell others that Jesus is Lord by the way, you love glorify and reflect him There's a bottom line for today's message is submitting to Jesus should change the way you live And considering this I want to invite you to spend some time with God right where you are reflecting on the three questions We just walked through and they're on the screens Do you believe Jesus is your Lord? Does your life show Jesus is your Lord? And do you tell others that Jesus is Lord? So take a moment to reflect with right where you're at and parents feel free to reflect Alongside of your kids where you're seated and then I'll pray for us You Praise you for being our Lord today Thank you for a timely reminder in your word Of the access we have to you in Christ We praise you for that God Thank you that we are able to enter a relationship with you Be close to you not because of anything that we've done but because of what you've done for us And as a result God you called us to live a life that reflects you that resembles you Bears your image. I Pray that you would help us to show That you are our Lord both in private and in public God I pray that you embolden us to share with others to tell people about the good news of the gospel Help us to not fear Lord help us not to seek selfish pursue selfish ambition or Glory for ourselves God, but to give credit all the glory back to you God because you are the giver of our lives Your word says that we breathe the fact that we have breath in our lungs is a gift from you You are the giver of all things God and we give you credit for it God I pray for those in this room who are yet to follow you God. I pray Lord that you would open their hearts Open their eyes to understanding Lord of their their need for your love your grace and your mercy I pray God that you would meet them right where they are God, I pray that they would they would submit to you as Lord over their lives God we love you God because of what? Because your word says that you first loved us We praise you for your goodness in our lives. I pray that as we submit ourselves to you That it would truly would change the way that we live Help us to honor you and everything that we do We pray this in your name. Amen
