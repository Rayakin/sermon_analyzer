Good morning, how's everybody doing? That was a little weak. We're gonna get there though. We're just gonna lean into this thing. Okay. Thank you very much Welcome to family worship sunday. This is where all the generations gather together We give our awesome next gen serve teams the week off and so that means you mom dad caregiver It's your week on and it gets a little rowdy in here, but we lean into the rowdy and I try to up my Illustration game to keep people engaged and try to do what I do in a quick fashion So let's get after it today james chapter three. So I recently went skeet shooting anybody ever been skeet shooting shooting it out of the skies a Disc that's thrown out there. I know that you uh, if you know me I grew up in the southern part of the united states and Uh, you might hear a little bit of a southern accent in me and you might think this guy probably has Some history with guns, but I really don't I uh I've never walked into the woods looking for dinner. Okay, I go to giant food store to look for dinner I don't go to the woods looking for dinner. Uh, i've never really shot any uh thing out of the sky Um, and so when my friend asked me to go with him, I gladly did it, but I was a little bit intimidated But then I started thinking no i've played duck hunt before okay Anybody ever played duck hunt before duck hunt listen for you kids. You got you got fortnite going for you That's a decent game, okay, but duck hunt is like peak video video game experience Are you guys tracking with me? This is where the the you've really peaked out in video gaming And so I tapped into my duck hunting experience in my skeet shooting time and I actually got pretty good at it because uh what you what you really need to do is begin to see where that skeet is going and Anticipate kind of the future and be out in front of it. You guys tracking with me similar in duck hunt And so I actually got pretty good and out of a few hundred Discs, I shot one or two out of the sky Now I was studying our passage james chapter three this week and it made me think of my time skeet shooting and that's an odd Connection I'll give it to you But follow with me god desires for each and every one of us to be able to anticipate What is ahead and to make decisions? accordingly God's word is not just a list of rules of what's right and what's wrong It also provides us a framework by which you can make better decisions in life and after uh in making better decisions requires More than you just knowing what's right and what's wrong your life should be well positioned according to god's purposes and his plans and a well-positioned Station is where you need to be when you're skeet shooting Also, you should anticipate where life is going very important when you're skeet shooting and you should have the long view End of your life. You should be looking out in front and making Decisions accordingly today ladies and gentlemen boys and girls of all ages We're talking today about wisdom about wisdom Now that's not a topic of conversation that is prevalent in our culture today Students, I don't know if you saw any social media posts this week about wisdom anybody Anybody's social media filled up with posts about how you can become a wise teenager. It's not really there Even though this is a key Theme in the bible. It's incredibly important. But the reality is is most teenagers don't have a hunger for wisdom I've not experienced one moment in my parenting of teenagers where my teenager walks in the room sits me down and asks dad What's the wise thing to do in this situation It just hadn't happened maybe in your house We've talked about what's right and what's wrong what's good and what's bad what's righteous and evil But i've we've never really had that moment where I didn't prompt them to ask me the question What's the wise thing to do here? For teenagers, you don't really hunger after wisdom, but even most adults have a deficient View of wisdom many adults do not know how to use the wisdom of scripture the wisdom of god To guide them in matters of everyday living but for king solomon Who had just begun to reign over israel when asked by god, what's one thing you want? What was his reply? Think about that kids if you could ask one thing from god Students you get one thing It's going to be a yes, whatever you put on the table Adults, where are you going with that question? For solomon he asked for wisdom Not power Not wealth not fame not a long life In fact solomon wrote in proverbs 8 verse 11 for wisdom is better than jewels And all that you may desire cannot compare with her You can't desire for anything that is more valuable than what we're talking about today Solomon knew something that we need to wrestle with today and that is that wisdom is far more valuable than fortune or fame And it is essential to get it And to increase your levels of it in order to navigate life As god intends you to do Proverbs chapter 4 verse 11 and 12. It says I have taught you the way of wisdom I have led you in the paths of righteousness When you walk your step will not be hampered And if you run you will not stumble when you get wisdom and you are on the path of wisdom You can take steps forward and not stumble you can take off running and and you're not going to stumble This is where we're going today Ladies and gentlemen god's desire for each of our lives is to be on a path that will lead to better decisions In fact, there is a path there is a way of life There's a skill that will allow you to make better decisions resulting in fewer regrets And that path is paved with wisdom and god's word says at all costs Whatever you need to do to get this do it Because all that you desire cannot compare With her I remember being a teenager students. I'm tracking with you I understand your life in some ways because I was a teenager before And if I could just be real in this moment, I remember being a teenager and not necessarily Disagreeing with the truth claims of christianity. I didn't reject christianity because I didn't think it was true I rejected christianity in a lot of ways because I thought it was boring I thought what it would do would be confine me and constrain me into a life That would restrict some of the fun that I wanted to experience in this life And maybe you're sitting here today and you're thinking man Pastor if you're talking about better decisions And what's the wise thing to do? That's really going to restrict me come friday night. I'm, not sure if I want this And if I could would you just please hear me out when I tell you this wisdom is not a suppressor of life Wisdom is a suppressor of unnecessary regret And every time I look back on decisions that I made as a young adult who lacked wisdom I experienced a lot of regret And what I want to do is help you Not believe the lie that I believed when I was young Which was this fun thing This thing that god says is probably not the wisest thing to do is going to actually lead to a lot more fun when in fact it led to more emptiness Disappointment and bitterness and god wants more for your lives He wants so much more and james is here to talk to us about a beautiful faith that is full of wisdom And he calls us to examine our lives to ensure that we have that kind of faith Kids, I want you to think about the wisest person that you've ever come across Think about the wisest Individual that you've ever come across In your life. I asked that question this week as I knew I was going to be preaching on wisdom And we're at the dinner table and I asked that question to the taylor family and one of my little guys said master uguay Kids You know the one-liner Yesterday is history Tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. That's why they call it the present So is that what wisdom is? Just some really old sages dropping one-liners on us Is that what wisdom is is that what we're aiming for is that what is more valuable than anything you could possibly desire Is to get to an age where everything is just you just look at yourself You're like i'm old but I can surely drop some one-line zingers. Is that what wisdom is? Well, we need to define wisdom and james in the passage that brayden read a few moments ago starts out with a question And the question is this in verse 13 of james chapter 3 who is wise and understanding among you If we're going to determine who is wise we need to know what wisdom is So first you need to know that wisdom is more than knowledge and information Wisdom and knowledge are not the same thing a wise person will be knowledgeable, but a knowledgeable person is not necessarily wise Now I don't want to cut out from up under Cut out the legs from up under our parents who are gathered with us today that put a high priority On studying and passing exams and doing your best I know that there's an important aspect in which we uh, we devote to academic excellence But can I tell you that god's word doesn't put a lot of weight on us knowing some information so that we can pass an exam God's word doesn't put a lot of weight on you knowing information so that you can flex your intellectual ability around other people It's just not that weighty of an emphasis in the word of god God's word doesn't want to put a lot of weight on that because wisdom is more than knowledge and information You see knowledge builds the titanic. It took a lot of knowledge to build that boat. Did it not? But wisdom avoids the icebergs can somebody say amen Amen Knowledge builds a house. You need a lot of knowledge and information as how to construct a house, but wisdom builds a home Wisdom builds a home You see knowledge knows a lot of facts about god There's a lot of people that can can just spit out a lot of intellectual knowledge about god but wisdom Walks with god Wisdom walks with god. You see you can be very knowledgeable And still be a fool Wisdom is the ability to apply that knowledge and understanding in such a way that makes your life Work and one author has said correctly of our culture today. We are drowning in information But we are starving for wisdom So wisdom is more than knowledge and information and wisdom is more than right and wrong Wisdom helps you know what to do when there's not a clear right or wrong decision You can be a very moral person And still be unwise Wisdom helps you know what to do when your teenager begins to question their faith Wisdom helps you know what to do students When your crew of friends are plotting to ditch someone because they don't really like that person that's wisdom Wisdom is going to help you when that moment arises and your friends are putting together a get together at somebody's house Knowing that their parents aren't there that's going to take some wisdom in that moment Wisdom knows helps you know what to do when you lose your job Wisdom helps you know what to do when you come into some inheritance The word wisdom in scripture includes being moral but it goes beyond that It's making the right decisions when there's no moral clear moral law telling you what to do Now some of our decisions you're going to make this week. All you need to know is knowledge You get sick. The doctor tells you what's medicine to take all you need to know is the knowledge I need to go get that medicine and take it But other decisions you make are going to need you're going to need to know god's moral law You you don't have to pray about fleeing sexual immorality, there's a clear right or wrong there So when you're faced with a situation to view inappropriate images or inappropriate videos You don't need to sit there and pray for wisdom you flee God Has already spoken in those instances There's an obvious right an obvious wrong, but there's no bible verse to tell you exactly who you should date Parents, I know i'm I'm stretching it here. You're thinking. Oh, yes, there is I I can tell you exactly where that bible verse is Listen, it's a wisdom decision There's no clear right or wrong It tells you Wisdom tells you who you should marry Wisdom helps you know how to use your smartphone When to use your smartphone where to use your smartphone. These are wisdom Issues and making a wrong decision in areas like this can be very costly There's not an obvious right or wrong On how to set boundaries with difficult people. Can somebody say amen? Has anybody looked for that verse lately? So wisdom Is more than knowledge and information and wisdom is more than right and wrong wisdom In fact is skillful living according to god's design And purposes that's what wisdom is skillful living according to god's design And purposes, that's what wisdom is skillful living according to god's design and purposes And that's why james asked the question in verse 13 Who is wise and understanding among you and then he answers this way by his good conduct let him show his works in the meekness of wisdom It's not brain power. It's not theological education. It's not what you know that proves you're wise It's your life. It's your conduct. It's your decisions and whether or not those day-to-day decisions are grounded in god's good design and flow out of god's glorious purposes For you and in this world that is wisdom and james is saying a beautiful faith a real genuine faith in jesus One that flows out of real relationship with the risen savior will produce a life that has wisdom And grows in wisdom And to clear the air a little bit james then takes the next few verses and he contrasts What is fake to what is real? He says hey, I need you to know what the fake looks like and I need you to know what the real looks like Ladies let me help you. It's like buying or carrying a louis vuitton bag You're tracking with me Some of you are looking down at the the carpet. You're like, please tell me he didn't see it No, listen like buying a louis vuitton bag. I'm not i'm not hating on you Okay, if you've got a fake louis vuitton, I I can respect that Okay but what happens is is you need to know what the real thing looks like and what the fake thing looks like and there's Not really much difference in terms of life value and whether or not you got the real louis vuitton or you got the fake But james is coming in saying no no, listen What we're about to talk to is really talk about is very important And if you have the fake stuff It's going to be very obvious And here's what this looks like And if you have the real thing This is what this is going to look like And so james goes in in verse 14. He says but if you have bitter jealousy And selfish ambition in your hearts Do not boast and be false to the truth He gives two characteristics of this fake stuff. It's this it's a life marked with bitter jealousy I want what you have I don't want you to have what I want that you have He uses the word bitter because it means it's malignant it's spreading it's cancerous. It's working its way into everything And he uses the word selfish ambition He says listen ambition is not necessarily bad But selfish ambition is and and this is a a quality of life It's it's how you make decisions where you're at the center of it all You are at the center of it all. It's your world. It's your way you get your results You're the center and you you will drive that however you need in fact people oftentimes can become pawns in your hand Because you're operating out of this fake stuff And he says this fake stuff this fake wisdom pumps out decisions in your life in verse 15 He says this is not the wisdom that comes down from above So if this is the fake stuff Where is it coming from? Well, see you got to understand the fake stuff if you go to the book of proverbs the book of proverbs calls it foolishness foolishness Today calling someone a fool is an insult. But in proverbs a fool is someone who is out of touch with reality A fool makes life miserable for themselves and for those around them Ladies and gentlemen, you can't treat people. However, you won't and expect life to turn out well for you That's wisdom You can't live selfishly and expect your relationships to be anything other than a mess That's wisdom You can't treat your bodies. However, you won't or do whatever you want with your bodies Considering whatever the pleasure of the moment calls for and expect for anything other than a life of regret So ultimately foolishness this fake stuff is when you make anything the center of your life besides God and james says this is not the wisdom that comes from above So if it's not coming from above where is it coming from james and he tells us in verse 15 he says it's earthly It's unspiritual And it's demonic James didn't mincing words here. Okay inspired by the spirit of god. He's not like, ah, you know I mean it kind of came from a you know, not so good. It's demonic When that's your operating system When that when bitter jealousy and selfish ambition is kind of the the operating system by which you make decisions That is earthly unspiritual and it's demonic and he's not done because in verse 16 He says where jealousy and selfish ambition exists. There's your two qualifying characteristics There will be disorder in every vile practice There will be disorder in your life Your decisions will lead to more and more disorder disturbance upheaval Instability confusion your life will be more and more out of control But he says also there will be every vile practice. It will be evil That's the decisions that lead you to unwise That's a heart that leads you to unwise decisions and these things will result in a life That's less and less manageable I learned a military term This week in my study. It's fub f-u-b-b any military guys know where i'm going on this one We're gonna keep it pg. The fub means it's fouled up beyond belief That's the military term fub It's it's it's fouled up beyond belief and when you're operating with this earthly Unspiritual demonic wisdom your life will be a fub It will be fouled up beyond belief and some of you are looking at your life and you have all the right information You you could pass a theological test, but you're looking at your life and it's it's just a mess Relationally, it's a mess Circumstantially, it's a mess Your problem is not the information you have in your head you lack wisdom from above You lack wisdom from above and so james begins to tell us what the real thing looks like And he gives seven attributes of wisdom from above in verse 17, but the wisdom from above is first pure pure Morally blameless. It's undefiled. Your heart is pure in its devotion to god Matthew chapter 5 verse 8 says blessed are the what? pure in heart What happens to those who are pure in heart according to matthew 5 verse 8? They see God They see god Wisdom from above allows you to see god in your situation It allows you to see how god is at work in your circumstances Wisdom sees god. There's a pure motive you see god and there's a purity of focus on god He goes on to say in verse 17 then peaceable Is first pure then peaceable you seek peace because you are at peace Because you have wisdom from above Philippians 4 verse 7 says the peace of god talking to christians Says the peace of god talking to christians. It says the peace of god which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in christ So wisdom, isn't this anxious ball of energy around your life? Wisdom, isn't this nervousness this Just permeates your life because things aren't going exactly how you would want them to be So parents, let me ask you this question. Is your parenting? Reflecting that which comes from above Is it peaceable Sometimes parenting teenagers it can feel more like a a famous meme that went viral I don't know a couple of years ago. This is what sometimes parenting teens can you kind of experience life this way and you're like This there's nothing peaceable about this, right? And can I tell you why sometimes it's this way can we can we just can we just keep it real here Why is this way is listen to me? Because you're parenting young adults who have a serious deficit in wisdom And that can be very scary. Can it not parents? terrifying Students give us some grace, please It's hard to be a parent of teenagers because we can see where there's a deficit in wisdom You can know right and wrong and still make decisions and get down the road and have a life of regret And proverbs says that many young people lack this wisdom And so it can be really scary to parent teenagers And here's where I just want to give a plug to our student ministry parenting workshop You should have if you're a parent of a teenager received emails about this But this wednesday night at the douglas community center in leesburg Casey whitehouse our director of student ministry and myself are going to help parents think about how you can parent out of wisdom from above How you can be better listeners and better communicators with your students. There's going to be child care is going to be provided Students are going to have their own worship service where they can worship the lord and sit under god's teaching and parents We're going to get real And help you think through how you can parent your teenager with wisdom From above all parents are welcome. There's even going to be child care for younger kids I remember eliza. Huey our director of counseling Said one time we were in a meeting and she said a common mistake of parents is trying to hold on to authority as your child grows in age rather than stepping into influence And some of you you're parenting two-year-olds three-year-olds and you need to get some authority There's some right or wrong you need to do it right away all the way with a happy heart, right? But any parents try to do that with a 17 year old? It doesn't work as well Because you you're stuck in this Authoritarian authoritative role and god's word says wisdom means that you need to step into influence and sometime allow your students to make Decisions that might not be the wisest decision Everything's not black and white Everything's not right or wrong and our students need to grow in wisdom and part of parenting is helping them to grow in that wisdom So First pure then peaceable. He also says that wisdom from above is gentle. It's willing to yield You don't always have to be right Listen, you know, you're operating in god's wisdom the wisdom that comes from above when you can be wrong sometimes Number four is open to reason you're persuadable. You're a good listener You're open to reason you're you're also number five full of mercy and good fruits. This is more than just being nice Wisdom from above is more than being nice. It's giving practical help to those who are in need wisdom is compassion in action Is what james is saying? And he goes on he says wisdom six is impartial Your treatment is giving courtesy and respect to everyone Everyone Because they're made in the image of god everyone you treat you treat with courtesy and respect every waitress You encounter every car you encounter on on on rush hour in route seven wisdom from above Requires that you treat them with courtesy With courtesy and respect because they're made in the image of god and finally james says it's sincere It's living without hypocrisy what you see is what you get when you have wisdom from above There's no mass There's no pretense So james gives us these seven characteristics of wisdom from from above and james then gives a summary statement Which many believe is like a popular a proverb of the day in verse 18 He says in a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace So james wants to know Does your life look like this Do those seven attributes Do you do you have those attributes are you growing in each of those seven attributes? Do you have wisdom? Are you a wise man a wise woman a wise student? He wants us to see a faith that is beautiful and a faith that is beautiful You can't disconnect what you say. You believe with how you behave You can't do it And james is here to call us out and say listen a faith that is beautiful Is a faith that has wisdom from above? So if you want to see who is the wisest in the room We don't need to have a philosophical debate. We want to see who's the wisest Philosophical debate and we don't need to have a theological test. He says look at their life Look at their life. In fact, james is giving us a test And you don't pass or fail this test based upon the information you have You pass or fail this test based upon the wisdom that you live out in your life So students who in here really loves it when your teacher gives you a pop quiz anybody You weren't prepared that we had one here Okay, there's zero in my household that enjoy a pop quiz In fact when their teacher let's say their english teacher in high school gives them a pop quiz I hear about it at night, you know But james has given us a pop quiz. And so I thought Let's give a pop quiz. So everybody get your your phone out If you are an adult, you need to get your phone out students. You don't have to take this pop quiz, okay? Kids you don't have to take the pop quiz You just sit back and you watch and you need to go if you're an adult Whether you're a parent or not, whether you're a young adult or an older adult whether you're married or single Every adult is going to take this pop quiz that james has given us And again, you're not going to pass or fail based upon whether or not you have the right information It's going to be based upon Your life your conduct and here's How you do this? You can go to that qr code or you can go to minty.com and you can enter the code there on the screen I'm going to give you just another minute minty.com James is giving a pop quiz not pastor britain. This is james. I'm just letting the text do the work here. Okay? Let's go for it first question On this pop quiz, it's not testing your knowledge. It's testing your wisdom Do you pray about and humbly submit your decisions to god now before you answer the question? It's not asking do you humbly submit the decision of whether or not to go to church on sunday? James is asking what about monday afternoon? What about when there's conflict in the marketplace? What about when there's a disagreement in your home? Are you praying about and humbly submitting your decisions to god and your option is I rarely do this I occasionally do this I oftentimes do this thinking about the day-to-day decisions of your life or I always do this Now we have five Who are very bold in saying they always do this, okay? Okay Do you pray about and humbly submit your decisions to god let's go question number two Do you rely on god's word for guidance when making your decisions? Again more than the right or wrong decisions the day-to-day decisions How you invest your time? How you invest your money? How you relate to difficult people? Are you allowing god's word to give you guidance in making those decisions those wisdom decisions? So now we have double the number of people who are really bold In saying they always do this. Okay, there's going to be counseling sessions afterwards for those who are not truthful Let's go number three In your decisions, are you able to make connections with how god's world works and how your decisions relate? Do you see the connection there? Do you do you see the connection of your monday afternoon decision in the overall purpose of god for this world? Do you connect how you parent your small child? Do you connect how you parent your adult child that's out of the house? Are you connecting those decisions and how god's world works and how your decisions relate? to the purposes of god I'm happy to say that we didn't increase in the number of people who are inaccurate in their quiz taking Let's go to the next one Are your decisions reflective of what we've just looked at james chapter 3 verse 17 and 18 Are your are your decisions? pure peaceable gentle open to reason full of mercy and good fruits impartial And sincere is that is that? Is that reflect what your decisions look like? Again rarely Occasionally often or always Finally had a few people wisen up. We only have two here. Okay So there's your pop quiz from james And can I tell you something in closing? If we were all to be rigorously honest If we were just to take a run through of all the decisions we made last week If we were just to put a gopro on your chest For the next seven days, that's pretty terrifying, isn't it? Think about all the thousands of decisions you're going to make This week the reality is none of us are entirely wise So, how do we get wisdom? How do we get the stuff that comes down from heaven and this is where I want to close Today, I want to give you four steps from god's word I want to encourage each of us today If you want wisdom from above and you can write this down first off be reverent be reverent reverence is a healthy form of fear In proverbs 9 10 says the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom So you can't have a small view of god And be a wise person Fear has this massive glorious view of god his greatness and his goodness are off the charts and And and we're driven down the pathway of life driven down the pathway of our decisions Based upon that big view of god There's a book that I I hand out oftentimes like candy I just give it out left and right and I really love the title I love the content of the book The book is entitled when people are big and god is small anybody read that book when people are big and god is small Wisdom would tell you that god needs to be big in your life the exact opposite That god needs to be big You need to have this glorious view of god and you need to humble yourself and submit yourself under that Great view of who god is and all that he has done. So the question is do you have a big view of god? In your decisions are you on your knees and humble submission to his greatness and his goodness? Is that the the quality of your life? Cory ten boom a holocaust survivor and a devout christian emphasized the role of trust in divine wisdom And here's what she said. She said never be afraid to trust an unknown future to an known god Is that not a good word? Don't be afraid There's a lot of unknowns out there But wisdom begins to trust a known god God is big second step Be reverent and secondly be repentant now That's a churchy word for some of you who are newer into these spaces. You might not know where i'm going on this That's an important word And part of the meaning of repentance is that you see sin is bad That you see your own deficiencies you see your own tendencies to go against god But the other side of repentance is turning to someone. Do you know who that someone is? jesus So be repentant means that you're turning to jesus and guess what when you turn to jesus Jesus is wisdom Jesus is wisdom in first corinthians 1 24, but to those who are called both jews and greeks christ The power of god and the wisdom of god So listen to me when you turn back to jesus In your life when you're tempted to go away and you turn back to jesus you're turning back to wisdom Wisdom When when you go wayward in your faith journey and you turn back to jesus you're coming back to Wisdom listen to this quote from paul shrupp author paul shrupp He says to sinners and that includes all of us wisdom is not natural It's hard to gain wisdom by research or experience because they are filtered and interpreted by our own foolish hearts Here's where the bible greets us with a radical counterintuitive message. You can't buy wisdom You can't get it by hard work or lots of experience. No wisdom. Listen up wisdom is the result of rescue and relationship That's the that's that's where wisdom comes out It's the result of rescue and relationship to be wise you first need to be rescued by from you You need to be given a new heart one That's needy and humble and seeking and ready to get from above what you can't get from the earth and you Will need to be brought into right relationship with the one who is wisdom He goes on he says this think of this grace has connected you to the one who is wisdom Grace has caused wisdom to live inside of you That means that wisdom is always with you and is always available be repentant constantly turn back to jesus fourthly be Thirdly be reading the written word So be reverent be repentant and be reading the written word How much of your life is invested in reading and meditating and knowing and studying god's word Jesus himself said everyone who hears these words of mine and does them will be like what a wise man Who built his house on the rock sit in the word of god study it Get in groups with other people and pray through it study it ask questions about it You need god's word and in it you will become wise and finally fourthly Be requesting more wisdom We saw this earlier in the book of james James chapter 1 verse 5 if any of you lacks wisdom if you lack wisdom right now if you didn't have the always answer in every one of those questions Then you can just ask god for more wisdom And he says let him ask god who gives generously to all who are without reproach and it will be given to him so god's desire for each of our life Each of our lives is to be on a path that leads to better decisions to be on that path To have the way of life to possess a skill that will allow us to make better decisions and that path the way of life that skill is wisdom And god's word says to every one of us whatever it takes Get it Get it. Let's pray together So As we Come to a time of response to the preaching of god's word We want to give every single one of you every boy and girl every student every adult the opportunity to respond to god's word today and i'm going to ask the worship team to come on back up here and they're gonna Get ready to lead us in a time of response in in a worship song But first I want to put two questions on the screen and I want you to be able to take just a few moments With these questions Do you know and walk daily with jesus? He is the one who is wisdom Every day of your life A day lived in relationship in abiding relationship with jesus, or do you even know him? For some of you the response today is to turn from your sin and yourself You're looking at your life and there's a a boatload of regret And it's unmanageable Because you've been operating out of a system that is Unspiritual and it's earthly and demonic and god's calling you today To repent to turn from your sin and yourself and to turn to jesus Some of you have made that decision you're you you you have a new heart But this is a this is something that's kind of been put on the back burner for some time And you need to return to jesus Do you know and walk with daily with jesus? The one who is wisdom and then the second question is this what practical steps can you take to cultivate? God's wisdom in your life. Maybe you take just a few moments and in journal or pray and ask god help me cultivate Wisdom in my own life. I'll give you just a few moments to do that
