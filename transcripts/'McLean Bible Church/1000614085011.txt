If you have a Bible and I hope you or somebody around you does, let me invite you to open me to Mark chapter 12, what Chuck was just sharing about government and the church just so happens to be where we are in God's word today. So as you're turning, I wanna make sure to welcome those of you in Arlington and MoCo and PW and Loudon, as well as others online who are physically unable to be with us. It's pretty unique that we're gathered right now in all these different locations in Metro Washington DC, the capital of our country, the seat of government and one of the most prominent and prosperous countries in the world. And God is about to speak to us right now about government. So how does God relate to government? How does God relate to Congress and the Supreme Court, to legislators and lobbyists, to politicians and a president? And how do we relate to government and those who govern us? Should we submit to government or challenge it? Do we obey it or change it or both or neither? What if we don't agree with our government? What if we are persecuted by our government? Is it ever right to disobey or defy government? If so, when? Should we work in government? How else might we participate in government? How do the laws of our government relate to the laws of our God? Should all sin be a crime? If not, then what sin should be a crime? Should we be a Christian nation? Have we ever been a Christian nation? Is any country a Christian nation? So to be clear, I don't plan to answer all of those questions today, but I do wanna show you a passage of scripture that gives us two foundational truths for understanding how God relates to government that are critical for us as the people of God to understand, and not just to understand, but to live according to, particularly in this city. So let's dive into the timeless word of God that transcends kings and countries and presidents and politicians and policies. I just wanna walk through this text word for word, like phrase by phrase, then step back and consider what God, who's here among us right now, is saying to you and me, particularly in this city. So Mark 12, verse 13 says, and they sent to him some of the Pharisees and some of the Herodians to trap him, him being Jesus here in his talk. So let's pause there for a moment and think about what's happening. We looked last week at the end of Mark 11, when three groups that represented the religious elite among God's people came up to Jesus on a Tuesday, and they were mad because on Monday, Jesus had overturned tables in the temple and rebuked the type of religion they were practicing. If you remember, you can just kind of turn back in your Bible, Mark 11, verse 27, where you're at is they came to Jerusalem, he was walking in the temple, and the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to Jesus. They said to him, by what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you authority to do them? So three groups of people, priests, scribes, and elders. Well, now in Mark chapter 12, we're gonna see three successive groups come to Jesus to challenge him more. Here in verse 13 that we just read, it's the Pharisees and some of the Herodians. We'll come back to that in a minute. If you jump down to verse 18 in this chapter, which we'll look at next week, the group that's gonna come after Jesus is the Sadducees who come to him saying there's no resurrection, and they ask him a question. And then the next week, Lord willing, we'll look at verse 28, where we read one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing one another and seeing that he answered them well, asked him which commandment is the most important of all. And all of these different groups are trying to trap Jesus, to get Jesus to say something that will either ruin his reputation with the Jewish crowds or ruin his standing with the Roman government. Remember where all of this is building. So this is starting on Tuesday. By Thursday night, all these groups will have worked together to have Jesus arrested. And by Friday, Jesus will be dead. So this is a very intentional, coordinated attempt to eventually arrest, try and kill Jesus. So now back to verse 13, there's two groups here, the Pharisees and the Herodians, which represented a pretty unlikely alliance. The Pharisees were pro-Israel and the Herodians by name were pro-Herod, the governor of the Roman empire, which was occupying Israel. So these guys were normally enemies. On the opposite sides of the aisle, it was like the politically far right and the politically far left coming together in an attempt to trap Jesus. And the word for trap there is a word that's used to refer to catching an animal in a snare or a fish with a hook. In many cases, this word connotes a violent pursuit of something or someone. It's clear these guys are out for blood, literally. And the next verse says, so if you jump to verse 14, they came and said to him, teacher, we know that you are true and do not care about anyone's opinion for you're not swayed by appearances, but truly teach the way of God. Obviously this is feigned flattery, but it's also true. Jesus is true. And unlike these Pharisees and Herodians and other leaders, he did not care about their opinion. He was not swayed by appearances and he truly taught the way of God. And in their minds at this point, they're ready to set the trap, lay the bait with this question. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay them or should we not? So a little background here, the word for taxes here is kinsos. And the reason I point that out is because it's a transliteration of the word census. It referred to a head tax, a census tax imposed on every single resident of Judea and Samaria. Everybody had to pay one denarius a year, which was worth about a day's labor. We learn later in Acts chapter five, verse 37, that a man named Judas the Galilean actually led a revolt against this tax when it was established. It was deeply resented by the Jewish people. It represented Roman control over domination of God's people. And it had to be paid with a special coin that had the image of Caesar on it or the emperor Tiberius at that time. It had an inscription on this coin that said Tiberius Caesar, son of the divine Augustus, which basically meant son of God, which caused the Jewish people to hate this tax even more because it felt idolatrous. So these leaders are thinking, when they ask this question of Jesus, this is a no-win situation for him. If he says we should pay the tax, that will be unpopular with the people and tantamount to idolatry. All the people, Jewish people would see Jesus as politically aligned with Rome and they would revolt against him. But if he says we should not pay this tax, then the Roman authorities represented by the Herodians would see Jesus as revolting against them and they would have cause to imprison or kill him. You can only imagine the conversation between these Pharisees and these Herodians that led to this moment. They said, we got it. We know what we can ask him. We'll put this question out there. We'll have our cell phones out ready to record. And as soon as he answers, we'll put it on social media. We'll have the proof that will bring him down. So what does Jesus say? But knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them, why put me to the test? Again, he starts with a question that gets to the root of their question. Why are they doing this? When someone is trying to trap you with a question like this, it's usually not the question they're asking that is the real issue. It's usually something much deeper in their hearts that's the root behind the question. And that was certainly the case here. So Jesus pauses to look at them in the eye and expose why they're doing this. Because they're against him. They want him gone. But then Jesus continues. Bring me a denarius and let me look at it. And they brought one. It's kind of ironic in and of itself that Jesus didn't have this coin with him, but they're the ones who actually have the coin with them. And then he said to them, whose likeness and inscription is this? Another question. They said to him, Caesar's. And Jesus said to them, render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's and to God, the things that are God's. And they marveled at him. What a verse. Jesus just spoke in a way that was marvel worthy, not just because he evaded the trap they were trying to set. No, Jesus just made a statement that one writer called the single most influential political statement ever made in the history of the world. Jesus, in one sentence, just outlined the guiding statement for how people and God relate to government. I wanna draw you a picture that a friend and fellow pastor, Jonathan Lehman here in our city used to describe this relationship that Jesus just outlined, because it's often misunderstood. Many people read this verse and have this picture in their mind. Like you have Caesar's things over here, things that belong to government, a government like Rome or a government like the United States. This is the world of politics and government represented by this circle. And then you have God's things over here, things that belong to God. Almost like we might think of a separation between church and state. We picture that same relationship between God and government. You have the domain of government and you have the domain of God. And while Jesus is certainly acknowledging some distinction in these domains, this picture is not what Jesus is painting, because we know that God's things include all things. There is nothing, no thing that is not ultimately under the sovereign governance of God, including Caesar and worldly governments, which is what makes Jesus' statement this short statement so breathtaking. Follow the logic. When Jesus says whose likeness and inscription is on this coin. And they say, well, it's Caesar's inscription on the coin. Therefore, this coin belongs to Caesar. But step back. Where is God's likeness? Where is God's inscription? God's inscription is etched on the heart of every single human being. Here in verse 16, when we see this word likeness, Jesus holds up this coin, whose likeness is this? It's the same exact word we read in the very first chapter of the Bible, the very first moment when men and women are created by God. Genesis chapter one, verse 26, first mention of human beings in the Bible. God said, let us make man in our image after our what? Our likeness. So catch what Jesus is saying. He's saying Caesar's image is stamped on a coin. So give the coin to Caesar. But God's image is stamped on every human heart. So give God your heart. Caesar is worthy of a coin. God is worthy of your life. In other words, Jesus is not saying you have government over here and God over here. He's saying all things are God's things. Everything belongs to God. And some of those things under the governance of God belong to Caesar. But everything Caesar has as well as Caesar himself, they all belong to God. And this changes everything about how we view government and how we relate to government in this city, in this country, in any city in any country. So maybe write this down. Two foundational takeaways from God's word here. One, we humbly, yet conditionally submit to the government in our nation. Let's think about those words. We humbly, yet conditionally submit. The word for render, Jesus said, render to Caesar. What is Caesar? That means to give up something, to yield something, even as an obligation. And as the people of God, we are obligated, we are commanded by God to yield, to submit to the government in our nation. Romans 13, one makes this crystal clear. God says, let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God. And those that exist have been instituted by God. Therefore, whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed. And those who resist will incur judgment. You jump down to verse five in the same chapter. Therefore, one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God's wrath, but also for the sake of conscience. For because of this, you also pay taxes for the authorities or ministers of God attending to this very thing. Pay to all what is owed to them. Taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed. We saw similar language to this when we studied 1 Peter 2, verse 13. Be subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme or governors as sent by God to punish those who do evil and appraise those who do good. For this is the will of God. Just think about these passages, starting with Jesus' words in Mark chapter 12. They are shocking because these governments and emperors and governors that are being talked about here were not honoring to God in so many ways. We've already talked about it. They were idolatrous, exalting the emperor as a God. Yet Jesus says, render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's. And the Holy Spirit inspires Paul and Romans and Peter here to say the same thing. This is the will of God for you to submit to government. So just to flesh this out in a few practical ways, what does this mean for our lives? This means, well, one, we pay our taxes with integrity. That is the will of God for our lives. We do not try to cheat the government out of taxes through any sort of justifications we create. That is sin before God. It pleases God for us to pay taxes to our government fairly and accurately and not begrudgingly because this is a command of our God. April 15th is a day of worship in our country. You probably haven't been viewing it that way, but it is, right? This is God saying, you obey and honor me. When you submit to government in these ways, you glorify God by giving government its due with integrity, which leads to another practical implication. We honor and pray for our leaders. We render, we give respect and honor. Romans, 1 Peter 2, both use that same language, not just to leaders with whom we agree. 1 Peter 2 said, honor the emperor, i.e. the emperor who was persecuting Christians. Honor him. We have no excuse as the people of God for ever dishonoring a president or lawmaker or judge. Even when we disagree with someone, there is a way to disagree with honor. And God clearly commands us to honor those who lead us and to pray for them sincerely and continually. According to 1 Timothy 2, verse one through three, first of all, then I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way. This is good. It is pleasing in the sight of God, our savior. This is part of how we humbly submit to the government in our nation by honoring, praying for our leaders. Yet our submission is conditional. So here's another practical takeaway here. We obey our laws as long as they do not require us to disobey our Lord. We obey our laws. We subject ourselves to the laws of this land. We should be the most law-abiding people in our country. Even when we don't like or prefer certain laws, we obey them as long as they don't require us to disobey our Lord. But if there is a law or a legislator or a governor or government that is telling us either to do something that God forbids or to not do something that God commands, then in the words of Acts chapter five, verse 29, when the early followers of Jesus were being told not to teach about Jesus, Peter and the apostles answered, we must obey God rather than men. Because, remember, the circle within the circle. And this leads to the second takeaway. While we humbly yet conditionally submit to the government in our nation, we ultimately and unconditionally belong to the God over all nations. It's the image of God, not a government that is stamped on our hearts. And our government may be worthy of our taxes and appropriate honor and even a level of obedience, but God alone is worthy of our lives. We humbly and conditionally submit to government, we ultimately and unconditionally belong to God. Which means, so just consider the practical implications that fro from this. We align our lives and the church with Jesus and his word, not with a politician or party in this world. The church of Jesus Christ never belongs in the back pocket of a politician or political party. And as Christians, we have a prophetic calling to speak the word of God honorably, justly, compassionately, clearly and comprehensively to every part of our political sphere. We are Jesus people. We trust and give our total allegiance to one leader alone. The one who lived a sinless life, died a sacrificial death to pay the price for our sins and rose from the grave. We are not tied to politicians or political parties. We're tied to the King at whose feet every president, politician and person will one day bow and confess as Lord. Which means that more than we want a comfortable life in our nation, we want to spread the gospel of the kingdom among all nations. In other words, we are actually willing to let go of comforts in this country, to spread the gospel in this country and to every other country. We are not living to tack Jesus on top of an American dream as if he's icing on the cake. We get to live it up here and then go to heaven. That is foolishness. We read this earlier in Mark, Jesus's words in Mark chapter eight, verse 34, calling the crowd to him with his disciples. He said to them, if anyone would come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it. But whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospels will save it. For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul? We are not living for this world. We're living for another world, for another dream, a dream of every nation, tribe and tongue, hearing the good news of Jesus's life and death and resurrection from the grave, which means we sacrifice our comforts. We give our resources. We lay down our lives, even lay aside our freedoms to spread the good news of Jesus in this city and from this city to the ends of the earth, knowing that last implication, our hope is in God and his kingdom, not any government in any country. This is how Jesus taught us to hope and pray. Matthew 6, 9, our father in heaven, hallowed be your name in all the earth, your kingdom come. That's what we want more than anything else in this world. We don't want the greatness of our nation. We want the greatness of Jesus' name to be known in all the nations. We live for this. We raise our kids for this. We spend our money on this, seeing his kingdom come. We give our time to this. We set our hope on this. Matthew 24, 14, this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all the nations and then the end will come. In the end, our king will come and he will reign with righteousness and perfect peace and final justice and eternal joy. Why live for a fallible government in a country that will not last instead of giving our lives to the holy God whose kingdom will not end. So I wanna stop here and introduce you to a friend of mine. Some of you may remember she was here almost five years ago if you were here on that particular day. Her name is Gratia Burnham. And Gratia shared with us about how she and her husband Martin left this nation for the spread of the gospel to another nation where they experienced persecution in that nation and found themselves in the middle of an international crisis involving multiple governments. I found out she just so happened to be in town this weekend for an event that Voice of the Martyrs was hosting here at our Tyson's location. So I reached out to her to see if she could stay around a couple of extra days and be here today and she kindly rearranged her schedule. So if you don't know Gratia and Martin's story, I wanna show you a short video that will give you an overview and then I wanna invite her to share a bit with us in light of this word from God. Watch this with me. At the end of May, 2001, American missionaries to the Philippines, Martin and Gratia Burnham made the fateful decision to celebrate their 18th wedding anniversary in a secluded resort on the island of Palawan. About four in the morning, there was pounding on the door, bang, bang, bang, bang. And at first I thought it was a drunk guard or something and Martin kind of knew we were in trouble. And just as he got to the door, it burst open and in came three guys with M16s and I think one of them had a mask on. The masked men were Abu Sayyaf, a militant Muslim terrorist group with ties to Al-Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden. Along with 20 other guests, the Burnhams were forced from their room at gunpoint and taken many miles across the open sea to the Muslim stronghold of Basilan. For more than a year, the Burnhams were constantly on the move, living in primitive conditions in the jungle, evading capture from the Philippine military under the total control of their captors. They were the enemy and we never forgot that they were the bad guys. But on the other hand, they were our family. They were the people that we lived with for a year and hiked with and starved with. And you got to know the personalities of the guys. Throughout their captivity, the Burnhams had lived through 16 different gun battles between the Abu Sayyaf and the Philippine military. On the afternoon of June 7th, over a year since their abduction, the bullets erupted once more. I dropped from the hammock and before I even got to the ground, I was shot in the leg. And I kind of slid down the mountain. It was so steep. I slid down a little bit and came to rest beside Martin. And I looked over at him and he was bleeding from his chest. During the gun battle, the grenades were going off all around us in the shooting, but I just kept thinking every moment was my last moment. And sometime during that time, I just felt Martin's body just get real heavy, a heaviness. Tragically, Martin was killed during the firefight. Gratia was rescued and returned home amidst a national spotlight. Was there no way Gratia or Martin could escape? Sean Hannity, welcome to the show. Good to have you. Thank you for being with us. Thank you. It started as a romantic getaway for Martin and Gratia Burnham, American missionaries working in the Philippines. For her first daytime interview, I want to thank her for having the courage to be here today. Gratia, good to have you with us. Thank you. The outpouring of support was beyond anything Gratia could have imagined. Gratia Burnham lived through a real nightmare of fear, captivity, physical trauma, and devastating loss. Yet she has survived the ordeal and become more convinced of God's grace than ever before. Gratia truly has lived in the presence of her enemies and with God's help, has learned to fly again. Will you welcome Gratia Burnham with me? Thank you so much for being with our church family today. So happy to be here. There's so much I could say about Gratia, just the spirit of Christ in her, the humility of Christ in her. And I'm not even worried about talking about her humility that she's gonna be proud because she really is like, just the spirit of Christ is all over you. And we want you to know how honored we are for you to share. So let me ask you, we just talked about, we're willing to leave the comforts of this nation for the spread of the gospel in another nation. Why did you all, you and Martin, do that? You know, I think we just felt that God wanted us overseas. Martin had a skill piloting airplanes, and we thought maybe he could use it with getting the gospel to the world. And I must say that when we went overseas, we didn't have great faith. We had just a little bit of faith, but God has never despised small things. And Jesus even said, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you can tell a mountain to move and it'll move. So with a little bit of faith, I guess you think that God can supply your monthly support. And with a little bit of faith, God can help you reach that village with the gospel. And with just a little bit of faith, you can have children overseas and it'd be a really good thing. So, you know, we start off our walk with God with a little bit of faith and end up overcoming the world with our faith. Yeah. Love that. Like, just make that connection. I think sometimes we look at someone like Gratia or hear a story and think, wow, what a giant of faith for her to say, actually, it's just a little bit of trust and a really great God. That goes a long, long way. So you mentioned your children. And I think when we think about the comforts and the prosperity in our country, like that's to go and take, not just in your own lives, but to take children into another nation and to raise children in other nations. So how did, well, how has this story affected your children? Oh, well, our kids were born overseas and I think we all, they learned the lesson, and I did too, that missions is simply giving to God what is God's. Because the world will say, you know, you're your own. Or if you can dream it, you can do it. Or, you know, make good grades so you can go to a good college, so you can get a good job and make lots of money and buy lots of stuff when the way of Jesus is to deny yourself and to die to yourself. And that lesson was kind of just forced on our family in a unique way. But my children, of course, they're grown now and they love the Lord and they love looking back on their life in the Philippines. And, you know, I think in a way, our family's honored that for a little while we got to experience the fellowship of His suffering. Not everybody gets to do that. And so for us, it's an honor, yeah. I'll just let that soak in for a moment. That when fear starts to rise up in us, or what would it look like to live for the spread of the gospel in uncomfortable or costly ways, that there's actually a privilege waiting, not just in your own life, but in your children's lives to share in the suffering of Jesus in ways that, you know, we were talking about kids and grandkids before the service today, are flowing generationally in your family. So you do a lot with Voice of Martyrs, part of why you're here this weekend. As you pray for our brothers and sisters in persecuted places who are experiencing persecution, even specifically as a result of government, how do you pray for them? How would you encourage us to pray for them? I think our brothers and sisters facing persecution are just like we are. I think sometimes we think they're giant super people or awesomely spiritual, but they're just like we are, just following God with their lives. So often when I pray for those in hard times, I pray the same way I used to pray for myself in the jungle. Oh Lord, would you give them something to eat today? Would you let them have a cup of hot coffee with sugar in it, or just the way they like it? Would you help them to have a place to sleep tonight, a pillow or a blanket? Would you help them know deep in their gut, just have a peace that you're with them and you haven't forsaken them and give them the courage and the opportunity to share the gospel and give their families back at home, just peace in their hearts during this hard, hard time. Yeah. This is, I hope you just soaked all that in in a way that you can pray those exact same things. Just imagine walking through this text in, well, a variety of countries in the world right now. And what was really hard to hear was subjecting yourself to this government. And then you're thinking through the cost of disobeying this government for your life and for your children. So let's pray for our persecuted brothers and sisters. And then I've gotta ask you, like we talked about submitting to government, paying taxes. Okay, you were held hostage for a year. Tell us, what happened when you got back? Well, interestingly enough, we had missed paying taxes for a year while we were held hostage. So the next time tax season rolled around, I had to pay a penalty because I hadn't filed a tax return the year before. Funny, but true. But you know what? That year I paid my taxes with such joy because I was back in America. And in America, we have schools and parks and left turn lanes, my favorite left turn lanes here. And I just paid them with such joy, even the penalty. So a couple of things. One, I know that this church has influencers in our government. If somebody could like take some steps to work for just, like surely we could have let Gratia off for a year. But two, clearly we have no reason not to joyfully do what God's called us to do. So Gratia, thank you for living out what it means to submit to government, but ultimately submit your life to God. Would you thank God with me for Gratia Brown? Thank you. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. There's a lot there that I want to let us go to God with in each of our lives. So much like we have been doing, I wanna close with a question that'll be on the screen that will then lead us into a time of prayer and reflection before God. Actually, I wanna give you two questions to consider. Here they are. Number one, how can you more humbly and conditionally submit to the government in our nation? And just think about the practical implications we talked about from paying taxes, to praying for leaders, to honoring leaders, to obeying laws. Are there any ways that you can more faithfully be subject to our government before God? And then, are there any ways you're obeying men or people instead of God? So how can you more humbly and conditionally submit to the government in our nation? Like, God show us what you're calling us to do along these lines. And then second, how is God leading you to live more intentionally for his kingdom over our country? Through the way you approach politics, through sharing the gospel. Maybe you're letting certain trends in our country drive you to worry or fear instead of trust in God and resolve to share the hope of Jesus the King. Or maybe God is leading you to, as we've discussed before, in the short-term or mid-term, long-term to go to another country for the spread of the gospel. So I wanna invite you just to spend a couple of moments in prayer and reflection in this room and other locations. And then I'll lead us here in other location, pastors at other places. God, show us how we can more humbly and conditionally submit to this government in our nation. And God, show us how you're leading us to live more intentionally for your kingdom over our country. God, show us how we can more humbly and conditionally submit to this government in our nation. And God, show us how you're leading us to live more intentionally for your kingdom over our country. And God, show us how you're leading us to live more intentionally for your kingdom over our country. Amen. With your heads bowed and eyes closed, I do wanna ask one even more fundamental question than these of every person in this room. And that question is, are you a citizen of God's kingdom? I'm not asking what country on this earth your citizenship belongs to. Are you a citizen of God's kingdom? And the Bible teaches that the only way to become a citizen of his kingdom is through faith in Jesus as king over your life. Through faith in Jesus to forgive you of all your sin against God. And faith in Jesus to lead your life. I wanna invite you today, if you've never become a citizen of his kingdom, just to pray in your heart right now and say, God, I want to be a citizen of your kingdom. I don't wanna put my hope in any government in any nation. I wanna put my hope in you as the God over all the nations. You say to God, God, I have rebelled against you as my king. I have sinned against you as my creator. But I believe that Jesus died on a cross to pay the price for my sin. He rose from the grave as the victorious king over death. And today I put my trust in Jesus as the king, the savior, the Lord of my life. Oh God, we praise you as the king over all the nations. We praise you for the privilege of being citizens in your kingdom. We praise you that our hope is grounded in you, not in any human government. As thankful as we are, God, we thank you for so many good things in our government, including things Gratia just pointed out and so many others. God, thank you for the freedoms we enjoy, for the opportunities we have. God, thank you so much for your grace toward us in our government. We pray together for leaders of our government. God, please help them to lead in ways that reflect your justice and your mercy, your character. God, we pray for President Biden, Vice President Harris. We pray for members of the cabinet. God, we pray for senators, congressmen and congresswomen. We pray for Supreme Court justices, for other judges and lawmakers and governors and mayors. God, we pray for your grace over them. We pray for their salvation in Jesus. We pray for your common grace in and through their lives. Please help them to lead well. And God, we pray for other nations represented around even just this room right now. Can we just do that? Like even all at one time, just if you're from another nation originally, or your family lives in another nation, just call out that nation right now before God, out loud. In the name of the Lord. God, we pray for your grace over the leaders of all these nations, governments in these nations. And we pray for our Christian brothers and sisters in those nations. That you'd help them to willingly submit to government. Humbly do that. And when necessary, to obey you rather than men. God, we pray for our persecuted brothers and sisters around the world right now. Please, as gracious shared, please provide for their needs today, we pray. Give them that sense in their gut that they are not alone. That you are with them and for them. We pray for a cup of cold water. We pray for a good night of sleep. God, we pray for relief from oppression. We pray for deliverance from prison. We pray for faith in the middle of fearful circumstances. Pray for your peace. We pray for your provision for them, for their families, their churches. God, we pray for our family around the world who are obeying you rather than men and experiencing much cost as a result. We pray for them to continue to spread the gospel of your kingdom in the middle of that cost. And God, we pray all the more so in light of the freedoms we have. Help us, though we live in a place where we don't have to be afraid of being put in prison for sharing the gospel this week. Yet we are so often silent with the gospel. God, please, may it not be so. Help us to give our lives proclaiming the gospel this week. And we pray that you'd bring more people into your kingdom as a result. God, we praise you for your word. And we pray, especially in this city, that you would help us to live it out faithfully. In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
