Alright, let me see Arlington. It is good to see you guys this morning. If you got a Bible go ahead and head to Hebrews chapter 10 Hebrews chapter 10, we're gonna be in verses 24 and 25 this morning And so if you've got a Bible you're looking for Hebrews Hebrews is closer to the end of your Bibles. If you don't have a Bible with you, no worries The passage will actually be on the screen this morning. So let's do this as we dive in I'm gonna take a moment to pray. All right Let's pray together Father we love you And the only reason why we're able to love you is because you first loved us We are recipients of your never stopping never giving up love and you desire not simply for us to receive your love But also to reflect your world to reflect your love to a watching world Father you desire for us to hear your word today and to be encouraged And to encourage one another To go out into the world as your conduits So father, will you help us to do that today? You have to respond to your word Maybe not just hear it and forget about it Maybe not just hear it and critique it May I not get in the way of what you want to do today? But father may we hear your word and like your word falling on fresh soil And we hear it and we receive it and may we do it We can't do it on our own God. We need you and I pray these things in the name of Jesus if you agree say Amen. Amen. Hey guys, so my wife and I so we don't watch too much TV together, but we did watch a show that we picked up during the pandemic and it's the show I'm called alone. I don't know if you ever seen this show the show it alone It's a great show and the show is honestly just like it sounds right? And so you got these contestants these contestants get dropped off by themselves and some harsh Unforgiving environment with a whole lot of wild animals and me and my wife we would sit on the couch eating snacks Discussing with each other what we would do if we were them, right? That's what our watching this show consisted of right and so the whole point of the show is all about who's gonna last the longest As the show goes on you start to see people drop off for them for the understanding For reasons that are understandable, right? Some people dropped off because they were hungry some people dropped off because they were hurt But there was another reason while many people dropped out of the show And I'm sure this reason was a reason that many of these contestants Actually thought about before they got on the show. They thought that they could push through this reason and they were incredibly wrong And so interesting on this show that more often than not people dropped out because they were lonely People dropped out because they missed their communities they missed their families it became unbearable for them to exist outside of the context of a community of people and What is true about this show is also true of life You cannot live life in the way that you've been that you've been intended to live it You cannot flourish at this thing called life without people beside you without people in your corner And for so many of us we actually think we can For so many of us we're like these idealistic contestants on the show alone You think that your solitude is something that you can simply adapt to and live in And for so many of us the reason why we think that it's because people have hurt us in the past That's so many of us for many of us we've been in communities whether that's a specific family Whether that's some group or whether that's even a religious community like a church And those people or those communities have wounded you deeply and because that has happened people feel dangerous And for so many of us in response to that we tell ourselves listen if living close to people means that I might get hurt again I'm just going to adapt to being solo I'll be fine but here's the issue you won't be fine Here's the issue you won't be fine why is that because as the saying goes and I'm going to put it on the screen so you know this We are wounded in community but we are also healed in community We're wounded in community but we're also healed in community Hear me today you you might not be healed in the same community that wounded you But one thing is for sure you would not be healed by going solo We are made for a community think about this when God created the world It was not completely good until he created community The God created the thing all of these that we see the sun and the stars he flung those into space He said good good good he created he created man very good And then all of a sudden he saw a man by himself and he said not good What did God make he made community it is not good for man to be alone And that's been the case every single since ever since Community is how God's people survive It's how we survive y'all if you are a believer in Christ you cannot survive on your own You need people and we need to remind each other and challenge each other to keep going Because if we don't as soon as life shin checks us with things like temptation grief loss or pain If we don't have people around us encouraging us guys we'll just throw in the towel We'll quit this thing called the Christian life And so to that end today I want to talk about the importance of community I'm going to focus on two verses of this morning and that's going to be Hebrews 10 24 through 25 So let me read them it says this It says and let us consider how to stir one another to love and good works Not neglected to meet together as is the habit of some But encouraging one another and all the more as you see the day drawing near And this is the Word of God So honestly today is not going to be all these neat points that I come up with I'm going to simply spend time walking through this text But first let me actually set it up and let me explain to you what's happening here So when Hebrews 10 the writer is explaining how Jesus is the once and for all sacrifice for our sins That we are able to now have access to a holy God to the God of the universe Because Jesus shed his blood for us And if you have trusted in Jesus You can now know to the depths of your very soul that God is not angry with you But you can know this that God no longer has any issues with you Because Jesus paid the penalty for your sin God looks at you with the same approval with the same love The same affection that he looks at as he looks at his own son That because of the finished work of Jesus Christ at Calvary We are under the gaze of a God that when he looks at us His heart is bursting towards us with love and compassion Do you know this? If you are not a follower of Jesus I want you to hear this this morning That God has made a way for you to be made right with him He has and that is in what Jesus Christ has done for you And my question is this how would your life change if you truly believe that? If you truly believe that when God looks at you he doesn't see a failure That when God looks at you he doesn't see a screw up That when God looks at you he doesn't see someone that he can't wait to get his hands on But that when God looks at you that when you stand before him That you can stand before him in confidence like Hebrews 10 19 tells us What if you truly believe that when the Holy God looks at you That his heart can barely contain the love and the joy and the compassion that he has towards you What would your life look like? This passage of scripture actually tells us what would happen if you truly believed that So in this larger passage we actually see three things That we would have freedom in if we truly believed in the gospel In what Jesus Christ has done for us And so I want to talk about these three even though the passage that we're in only really talks about one And so the author from verse 19 to 25 He pretty much says that in light of what Jesus has done for us He says let us three times The first time he says he says let us draw near And what that means is this is that because of the gospel listen We don't got to hide from God anymore We don't have to hide from him anymore We can freely come to him we can freely confess our sin And we can expect to no longer find his wrath but to find grace You are free now to live in intimacy and closeness with God He says let us draw near But not only that he also says let us hope fast We are free to hope fast meaning this that we are now free To trust the promises of God no matter how life No matter how hard life gets I want y'all to hear me this morning When you are in Christ and you believe in the gospel you realize something You realize that the difficulty of life is not an indication that God has changed his mind about you I'm going to say that one more time because I think there's somebody in this room that actually needs to hear this Hear me this morning when you trust and believe in the gospel of Jesus Christ That means that the difficulty of life no matter how hard life gets The grief, the drama, the pain The difficulty of life is not an indication that God has somehow changed his mind about you Our God is faithful his promises are true No matter what we can trust him But today we're focused on verse 24 It's the last let us it says let us Consider how to stir up one another to love and good works Meaning this hear me when you understand that you are in love That you are loved and approved of by the God of the universe The infinite all powerful God who flung the galaxies into existence That this God loves you and approves of you Guess what happens nobody else's approval matters more than his You are free from the tyranny of other people's opinions And when you truly understand this this verse says You are now free to do something You are now free to no longer be fixated on yourself You are no longer free You are free to no longer be fixated on yourself The gospel actually frees you to focus on other people We are free to stop spending all of our time And all of our mental space considering ourselves Because honestly that's our bent that's what we do We walk around saying what about me And y'all a life spent walking around saying What about me is a depressing life It really is And yet what happens when you believe in the gospel is this Is that Jesus comes in he satisfies your soul With the thing that your soul desperately needs He fills you up so that we no longer have to walk around Saying what about me and now our hands are actually free To think about man what about other people What about you Y'all we are free to as verse 24 says We are free to consider That means to fix your mind on or to constantly think about How to stir one another up To love a good words Y'all that word stir up actually means To provoke or agitate And you might look at that phrase stir up And if that means to provoke or agitate You might think man that's the last thing I want to do to somebody Right but let me explain to you actually what that means Like when we think about provoking somebody We think about somebody who's intentionally Trying to ruin your peace Who's intentionally trying to annoy you Like I've shared this story before I used to have a roommate That it seemed like his mission was to like watch me squirm To annoy me and watch me be annoyed So he would do dumb stuff like he would go around the house And he would hide all of my left shoes Or he would like go to the TV And remove the HDMI cord and just watch me fiddle around With the remote right he found pleasure In annoying me and watching me get frustrated And I'm here to tell you that that's not what stir up means Stir up does not mean to annoy A peaceful person In this verse stir up actually means to shake a drowsy person It means to shake a drowsy person Let me ask you this question have you ever been in a situation In which every time you get in this situation It immediately leads you to get drowsy Some of y'all are looking at me and you're like Eric I'm in that situation right now I'm hearing you preach I'm drowsy Ha ha ha whatever but for me That situation is long drives If there's any kind of drive that's over two hours I'm automatically I'm getting tired I'm ready to go to sleep And so my family knows around the two hour mark I'm calling to the backseat for anybody who wants to take the wheel Because I'm going to sleep I'm calling out Janique Eli Roman who wants to drive because I'm going to sleep right And what I love about this text is that this text Implies that every single human being who lives Lives in a situation That will make you drowsy It will make you spiritually drowsy and that situation And that circumstance is what it's life in this world Life in this world will make us drowsy To the biggest thing that your soul needs The biggest thing that your soul needs The satisfaction that your soul has been craving for This is what you need You need to drink deeply from the well of God's love This is what your soul is thirsty for Your greatest need is to receive the love of God And to display this love to the world And this verse says that we need a community In order to help us do that This verse is saying let us consider How to stir one another up to love To receiving God's love in the deepest places of who we are And to good works meaning this That we need to be shaken to remember That God's love is our deepest need And expressing his love through good works is our greatest task This is what we need Guys to stir one another up towards good works That honestly means that we should be a community Of mercy and justice That our love That when we experience God's love we don't keep it to ourselves God desires to use that love that he puts in us To express love to a watching world To be a part of his effort to heal creation I love how Cornel West talks about justice That scholar Cornel West actually said He says justice is love in public Justice is love in public And we need to be stirred up to remember this Why is that? Because the culture of our world often runs counter To the culture of the kingdom of God And if we're not careful we will grow drowsy And we'll drift away from God's purposes in our lives Our culture of overwork will make us drift It will make us believe that our greatest need Is not God's love but it's the love of other people And it will tempt you to believe that you get that love By working hard, making money And seeing other people as your rivals Our culture of tribalism will tell you that your greatest need Is not God's love but other people's love And you get that by never challenging your own tribe And seeing everybody else not as rivals but as enemies Our culture of individualism Will tell you that your greatest need is not God's love But it's you loving yourself And that you get that by following your own heart You get that by never questioning your heart And other people, they're not objects of God's love anymore They're just minor characters in the drama of your life That's all about you And God is saying, listen, all of that is untrue Don't grow drowsy to the fact that your greatest need Is God's love and other people are potential recipients Of God's love through you Y'all, our world will make us drowsy to the wonder Of God's love and God has given each of us To each other as co-pilots To shake us when we get drowsy to alert us to our calling We're called to provoke To gently shake each other to receive God's love And to reflect the love of God and we need this And this is why community is a gift And this is why in this passage that it's no accident That when the writer talks about stirring one another up Towards love and good works Right after that he talks about Christians gathering with one another And this is why, y'all You can't hope to consider People that you never see You can't hope to consider people that you never see Because here's the thing, our lives are bent Towards considering ourselves Our lives are bent towards simply considering the people who are closest to us Our lives are bent to simply Consider the people who are like us But when we live in community as the people of God We have the opportunity to consider people that we otherwise wouldn't So here's my question, y'all Look around the room Who are the people that you know that you would not consider If you did not regularly see them Don't stare at them though, don't make it obvious But the beautiful thing about that It's the community of opposites And people who don't fit together When we begin considering one another and stirring one another Up towards love and good deeds It's the community of the church filled with opposites United by the gospel of Jesus Christ That's the community that's going to change the world So what if we did that What if Christian lawmakers in our church body And Christian unwed single mothers got together and actually thought How do we encourage one another and stir each other up towards love and good words What if that happened Y'all don't you think that certain policies would change as a result of that But us not living in silos What if the Christian elderly And young kids thought this way Don't you think our perceptions of each other might change What if family and lifelong singles Got together and considered how do we stir each other up towards love and good works Don't you think the way that we think about family The way that we think about community might change Y'all Christian community is our opportunity to consider one another And to give witness to the beauty of the kingdom of God This is a great thing Let's keep walking through the verse It says verse 24 again It says let us consider how to stir one another up towards love and good works Not neglecting to meet together as is the habit of some Let's pause there I want to zoom in on the word habit Because in our year 2024 Especially in the past decade There's been a revival of interest in the concept of habits So many books on the market Atomic habits, tiny habits All these books have habits in them And it's so interesting that people are reviving to the fact That habits shape us We're beginning to understand that we are our habits That we are what we repeatedly do And in this text we actually see people get the habit Of not gathering with other believers Like this habit is being formed in them And so in the book of Hebrews it's likely that these people Stop gathering together because the church of Jesus Christ Started becoming unpopular They started experiencing persecution And there's many people in that context that reason And you know what I'm going to step back for my own safety But I'm going to go back when things die down I'm going to go back And because we're a habit forming creatures they never made it back So that's possibly a reason What it was was a conscious decision To not gather that eventually became a habit It became automatic Or maybe that wasn't the reason There were just other things that were important to them There were things that they loved more There were other concerns that crowded out the habit Of living in community Whatever the reason is the text tells us that they formed a habit But hear me this morning here's the issue with habits We form habits then habits form us We form habits Then habits form us Here's the thing all of us have habits None of us are neutral And our habits shape our future Our habits turn us into the person that we'll become I love this author Justin Whitmell Early He writes a book called The Common Rule He says this about habits in his book He says we have a common problem By ignoring the ways habits shape us We assimilate it into a hidden rule of life When he says rule of life he's talking about a way of living And it's the American rule of life This rigorous program of habits The American rule of life Forms us in all the anxiety, depression Consumerism, injustice and vanity That are so typical of contemporary American life We desperately need a set of Counter formative practices To become the lovers of God and neighbor that we were created to be I hope you hear what he's saying here That you're not neutral That you have habits in every single moment of your life Your habits are being shaped And if you simply allow yourself to coast You will coast to accept the American rule of life And what we need is some intentional Counter formative practices That will actually transform us into a Christian community All this to mean this If you want to be formed into a disciple of Jesus Christ Into a person of love and joy and peace and patience And kindness and goodness and faithfulness and self control You will only get there through the means that God has given And God in his sovereign power Has determined that one of the means that he desires to use To form us into the image of his son Jesus Is Christian community You can't get around it Let me be clear here I'm not saying that if you go to church all the time you'll necessarily be transformed But what I am saying is this If we hope to be transformed by the spirit of God It would do us well to place ourselves In the path that the spirit is moving And one of the places that the spirit has determined That he will move is when Christians come together This is true Let me give you an example By way of analogy A couple of years ago an Arlington member took me out on a boat to go sailing And this wasn't one of those speed boats That all you did was you have a boat and a rudder Now this is one of those boats where like he had a whole bunch of sails And so man I'm like alright cool this is interesting I ain't never been on a boat like this And so I get on the boat with this guy and I felt useless Because as soon as we got out on the water I didn't know what to do But he's like feverishly working Like he's moving all around the boat he's pushing sails around He's raising sails he's lowering sails He's pushing them all around he's working But what's interesting is this That wasn't what caused the boat to move Him moving around sails him raising sails him lowering sails That wasn't the thing that caused the boat to move Raising the sails only put the boat In position For it to catch the wind that would move the boat So it's not his work that moved the boat It's the wind that did it right I'm going to bring it home to us To transform in the way of Jesus We need to feverishly work to raise the sails In our lives and believe that the spirit Is going to send the wind This is what sanctification is And one of the ways or one of the sails that we raise So that the spirit will blow his wind to transform our lives Is Christian community You would not be transformed without raising that sail And so I want to encourage you Don't give that up Don't give it up Let me say something here We often overestimate what one gathering will do And underestimate what a thousand will do We often expect to come to community And have an incredibly transformative experience The first time we show up But more than likely you will experience change Not through one gathering but through many It's the ongoing habit of gathering together And singing praises to God And hearing him speak through his word And gathering around living rooms all around our city That God transforms our lives One author actually put it well He said it this way It's not the one worship experience that forms you But the weekly rhythm of refocusing your heart and mind on the God who made you As you praise the Savior who redeemed you And since the spirit who's indwelled you Hear me today Don't underestimate what many gatherings can do to shape your soul But let me say something else as well Too many of us We think that we know There's a kind of Christian community that we need In order for us to grow And what I mean by that is that often We come to communities like this and we're just like I just want to be in community with people in my same life stage I just want to be in a community in which people share my same job Or have my same relationship status Or look like me and this is what I want to do And I know that that's the kind of community that I can exist in But it's only that for me to grow And that's us And listen let me tell you I disagree with that And this is what I mean There are many times in your life that you're going to come to a gathering of believers And you're going to feel like the oddball in some way You're going to show up to a group one week And you're like man everybody here is married and I'm single or vice versa You're going to show up to a gathering and you're like man I have this certain background and these people don't I get that and I get how that can feel like That can feel like a reason for me to bail But can I tell you that actually might be a reason for you to lean in And experience the joy Of building a relationship with people In which all you got in common is Jesus That's the reason I'm not saying that it's easy But I'm saying it is worth it And one of the worst things that you can do Is come to Christian community Practicing the American rule of life of consumerism One of the worst things that we can do Is to come to church and practice consumerism When we come and our first thought is I can't find people who are like me And God wants to teach us that his church That Christian community is not something that we conceive It's not something that we conceive It's something that we receive We don't decide who we receive When God saves somebody he puts them in a family And we say God by faith I'm going to trust that these people are a gift to me And I'm going to live with them Even when it's hard Let's keep going, we'll go home on this So let's keep reading the verse Not neglecting to meet together as is the habit of some But encouraging one another and all the more As you see the day drawing near So the verse is saying listen man we gather together We encourage one another, we provoke one another towards love and good works And then it says all the more As you see the day drawing near And it's likely that the writer of Hebrews had in mind The second coming of Jesus Christ That we're going through all the drama and the pain Of encouraging one another and burying one another's burdens And displaying all the one another's that the new testament has We're doing all of this in hope That when Jesus comes back face to face All of the pain that we experienced together as a people it will be worth it He said that we gather together in a community like this Because we all have a shared hope In Christ and his return Here's something about hope The direction of your life Is determined by whatever your ultimate hope is The direction of your life is determined by whatever your ultimate hope is And so if you think about your life right now Think about what you give your life most to And I promise you if you trace that You can trace it to whatever you ultimately hope in Whatever you ultimately long for Y'all everybody that you know is guided by hopes and longings Y'all everybody that you know is guided by hopes and longings Y'all it's likely that you find yourself at work You'll find yourself among people Whose longings and hopes are wrapped up in success It's likely when you find yourself among your friends Your hopes and longing are wrapped up In whatever pursuit is going on In the pursuit of a certain status The pursuit of a spouse, the pursuit of more square footage I don't know whatever your hope is But here's the thing, this is what I want you to know about hopes and longings Hopes and longings are contagious You can't exist in any kind of community Without their hopes and longings rubbing off on you A couple of things about hopes and longings One, hopes and longings are contagious And two, whatever the hopes and dreams of those around you are Sooner or later those will become your hopes and dreams I know that's the case for me I think about the hopes and dreams I've had throughout my whole life I remember growing up, I wanted to be a pro basketball player I remember growing up, I wanted to be a pro basketball player And the reason why is because everybody on my block wanted to be one And I'm like I want to be one too Even though at the time I was like 4'6 and I was like in 8th grade Like it wasn't happening When I was in high school, wanted to date a specific girl It wasn't because I thought she was great, it was because everybody else wanted to date her too Kept growing up And I wanted a particular career Because I saw other people with that career were well thought of And so therefore that's why I wanted it I wanted a certain kind of house with a certain square footage Because somebody else had that And listen, as I trace back all of my hopes and longings Two things, one, hopes are contagious And two, when we keep catching the hopes Of the people around us outside of our faith They will always leave us wanting something more If we keep catching hopes and longings from others Guess what, we'll be less dissatisfied We really will be Y'all, everybody that you are tempted Or everything that you are tempted to put your hopes And longings in If they are anything other than Jesus Christ You are going to be left disappointed in the end Y'all, everyday you are constantly bombarded by false hope Everyday you walk around And people are telling you become a size 2 And you will have the life that you always dreamed of Everyday you walk around and they're telling you get promoted And you'll have the life of your dreams Get ripped, get rich, get admirers And our hopes get so wrapped up there And all that leads us to is disappointment and regret in the end And you may look at me and you say Eric, I know that, why do you keep telling me this? But let me tell you this, you think you know But the fact of the matter is this What you think you know is not enough to withstand life in this world We are like cars out of alignment That as soon as you leave here Life in this world will cause you to drift away From the hope and the community That God has called you to have And God's tool to correct your alignment Is Christian community Christian community is what God desires to use To recalibrate your hope towards the true north Of the day of Christ's return We need to be reminded as I close, band can come back up There is no greater hope than Jesus Christ He gives us a hope That would not disappoint No eye has seen, no ear has heard No heart has imagined what God has prepared For those who love him All other hopes would disappoint you On Christ the solid rock we stand And I pray that our hope in this community Is on that day That day And what does this have to do with community? Far be it for us y'all To be a community that says that our hope is in Jesus But upon closer examination It's in another place Far be it for people to listen in on our conversations And conclude that hey you say that your hope is in Jesus But it seems that all you talk about is finding romance You say that your hope is in Jesus But honestly all you talk about Outside of church is your kids Your hope really is in them You say your hope is in Jesus But all you talk about is making money Or wanting a bigger place Y'all may it be that this is a community That stirs each other up towards love and good works In light of the day that is coming When we'll see Jesus face to face Y'all when we gather together and we sing praises to Jesus And we hear his word and we take the Lord's Supper And we gather around rooms in our city And we share what God is teaching us We are raising the sails so that Jesus can make himself Bigger in our hearts than the deans That we are tempted to hope in So I pray that we won't forsake this That we'll live life together stirring each other up towards love and good works Let's take a moment let's pray together Father we love you And God we are so grateful today That you have not left us alone That you have placed your spirit inside of us And we have brothers and sisters with us as well As we travel towards that day In which we'll see you face to face We know that there are many toils and snares along the way There are many opportunities that get distracted And one of the ways that you keep us Is by placing us in the body of Christ You place us in a context in which we have brothers and sisters To encourage us along the way That you alone will not get us to eternity We need your help And so father I pray that in our church body That for those of us Who don't have people in our lives To encourage us towards Christ's likeness I pray that we'll pursue that I pray that we'll pursue Christian community Whether that's in a church group I pray that we'll pursue a discipleship environment Where there are other brothers and sisters who can encourage us And I pray as a church that we will take that responsibility To stir one another up towards love and good works That we'll understand that when we're in our words And pursuing you each day That we're in the word not simply for ourselves But for our brothers and sisters in Christ as well And I pray that we'll be in a community That we'll consider what about me But that we'll look around and we'll be used by you the God of heaven To encourage our brothers and sisters To receive your love to the deepest places of who we are And to express your love to a world that desperately needs To experience it So father we need you, we love you I pray these things in the name of Jesus, Amen
