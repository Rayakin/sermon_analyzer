Hi, this is Joel and Victoria. Thanks so much for listening to the podcast. We believe you're gonna finish 2023 strong. 2024 is even gonna be greater. Thanks so much for being with us and enjoy the podcast. Come on, say it like you mean it. Ready? This is my Bible. I am what it says I am. I have what it says I have. I can do what it says I can do. Tonight, I will be taught the word of God. I boldly confess my mind is alert. My heart is receptive. I will never be the same. In Jesus name, God bless you. Sound great. I wanna talk to you tonight about stepping in to your divine destiny. Every one of us has seeds of greatness on the inside. You have a gift to share with this world. There is buried treasure down in you right now, potential that has not yet been released. But so often, we let other people talk us out of our dreams. We let disappointments and failures keep our treasure buried. We allow insecurities and low self-esteem to convince us that we don't have anything special to offer. We're just an average, ordinary person. But no, God did not make average people. He did not create any of us as ordinary. No matter what someone has told you, no matter how they tried to make you feel, listen to what God is saying. There is treasure on your inside. You have something to offer that no one else has. And if you don't step in to your destiny and release your gift, then this world will not be as bright as it should be. And understand, no one can take your place. You are unique. When God created you, he threw away the mold. Don't make the mistake of comparing yourself with someone else. If God wanted you to have their gift, he would have given you their gift. If he wanted you to look like them and have their personality, he would have created you that way. You don't need what they have to fulfill your destiny. You have what you need. It's already on the inside. When God created you, he matched you with your world. He decided what your purpose would be. He gave you an assignment, and then he put in you the gifts, the talents, the looks, the creativity, the personality. He equipped you with exactly what you need. That means if you needed to be taller, God would have made you taller. If you needed to be another nationality, God would have made you another nationality. If you needed a different personality, God would have created you that way. Quit despising what you have. Quit complaining about what you don't have. You are fearfully and wonderfully made. God has created you exactly the way he wants you to be. Think about with a car. You can purchase a car that's totally stripped down, just the basics. No AC, no power windows, no radio, just a standard car. But know this, when God made you, he had all the options put on. You are not a wannabe. You are not a stripped down version of the real thing. You are fully loaded and totally equipped. When God created you, he said, I want the deluxe package. I want the chrome wheels, I want the sunroof, I want the navigation, I want the stereo with surround, and oh yeah, don't forget my pinstripes. Some of you got a sedan, some of you got a compact, some of you got a truck, some of you got a lowrider. Don't be discouraged even if you got a station wagon, like my brother Paul. Whatever God has given you, you are fully loaded and totally equipped. I realize I may not have what someone else has. They may be a Ferrari and I'm a Ford, but I'm not the least bit worried. I know I have what I need to fulfill my purpose. When we try to be something that we're not, that's when life gets frustrating. I've learned it's easy to be me. I don't have to perform, I don't have to manipulate things, I can just relax and be myself. Do you know I can be a better me than anybody else in the whole world? Why? I'm anointed to be me, you are anointed to be you. Nobody can beat you at being you. Quit worrying about what you don't have and just be the best you that you can possibly be. I remember when I first started ministering, I was very intimidated and very unsure of myself. I would hear these other ministers that were so dynamic. Many of them could not only speak exceptionally well, but they could even sing incredibly well. At the end of their sermons, they just burst out into songs and it was so effective, it almost gave you chill bumps. I used to think, God, why can't I sing like that? Why don't I have their gift? But one day I realized God has given me what I need. If they have it and I don't, it must mean that I don't need it. And yes, they may be able to sing exceptionally well, but I know this, they're not near as good looking as I am. Friends, you are fully loaded and totally equipped. Don't you dare go around thinking, oh, I don't have what it takes. No, you go around saying, I'm anointed, I'm empowered, I am talented, I am creative, I am a fully loaded person. I heard about this young lady many years ago. She went to the theater and heard a girl singing so beautifully. She complained to her friends, if I could just sing like that, then I'd be successful. She went to the movies and saw an actress giving an award-winning performance. She thought to herself, if I could just act like that, then I'd be successful. But one day someone told her what I'm telling you. And instead of looking at others complaining about what she didn't have, she looked inside and discovered what she did have. She remembered how all through school, she was constantly making people laugh. She was naturally funny. She had this gift for humor. She went on to develop that gift, and today Phyllis Diller has become extremely successful. And what's interesting is she doesn't have the beautiful looks like the movie actress she saw. She doesn't have the incredible voice like the young lady she heard that was seen. In fact, her voice is very scratchy, very gruff. But when God created you, He didn't make any mistakes. And instead of looking at others thinking about what you don't have, why don't you look inside and you'll discover what you do have. The fingerprints of God are all over you. Before you were born, God knew you. He has planned out all your days for good. Don't let your potential lie dormant. Tap into that buried treasure. Share your gift with the world. You have more in you. There is talent you've not yet discovered. You may have had some great victories in your past, but that is nothing compared to what God has in your future. And if you will see yourself as a fully loaded person, totally equipped, then as you stretch your faith, God is gonna show up and show out in amazing ways. Now, I know tonight I am not looking at average people. I'm not looking at anyone ordinary. I'm looking at fully loaded people, victors and not victims. And I'm declaring the treasure that's been buried is going to come out. I'm calling forth the dreams, the gifts, the talents, the businesses, the ideas, the inventions, the books, the songs, the movies. I'm calling forth that untapped potential. I believe that you're going to step in to a new season. You're going to have a confidence to do things that you wouldn't do before. You're going to feel a supernatural strength. Supernatural doors are going to open up for you. Supernatural opportunities are coming your way. Don't shrink back. Don't be intimidated. The creator of the universe has not only equipped and empowered you, but he's breathing in your direction. He's breathing creativity. He's breathing confidence. He's breathing ideas. He's breathing restoration. God is saying to you what he said to Joshua, be strong and of good courage for the Lord your God is with you. And some of you have been told a thousand times what you can't do, but I'm here to tell you what you can do. You can overcome every obstacle. You can prosper in spite of the economy. You can be healthy and whole once again. You can recover from a fall. You can become all that God's created you to be. You are a can-do person, fully loaded, totally equipped. But if you don't understand who you are, then you'll never have the confidence to get out of your comfort zone and take steps of faith. This is imperative to fulfilling your destiny. I've learned when I make a move, God will make a move. When I get out of my comfort zone and stretch my faith, then God will release more of his favor. When I think bigger, God will act bigger. When I believe that I can rise higher and I put my shoulders back, I hold my head up high, and I walk like I'm a child of the most high God, that's when God shows up and shows out in unusual ways. One time in the scripture, when Lazarus had died, Jesus said to the disciples, roll away the stone and I'll raise Lazarus. It's interesting, Jesus could have rolled away the stone. Here, he was about to raise a dead man, but it was a principle. God expects us to do what we can, and then he will do what we can. If you will do the natural, God will do the supernatural. If you will do the ordinary, God will do the extraordinary. But God will not do for you what you can do for yourself. Well, you say, Joel, I never get promoted. I never get any good breaks. Let me ask you, are you rolling away the stone? Do you get to work on time each day? Are you giving it your best? Are you productive? Do you have a good attitude? If you will do what you can, God will do what you cannot. Maybe you're single, you have a desire to get married. You cannot sit at home every night watching television, praying that Miss America is gonna come knocking on your door. You need to get out and meet some new friends, go to the mall, get some new clothes, dress good, look good. You are a fully loaded person. You have a lot to offer. When somebody gets you, they're getting a prize. You are extremely valuable. You have the fingerprints of God all over you. You've got to see yourself the right way. Well, you say, Joel, I'm kind of shy. I'm kind of reserved. So am I, but I'm standing in front of thousands of people. Do you know how much nerve it took me to even call Victoria and ask her out on our first date? It took me two weeks to get my courage up. I finally convinced myself that I am a fully loaded person and she would be absolutely crazy to say no to me. I called her. She said yes, and I nearly passed out. After 22 years of marriage, I can tell you that Victoria is fully loaded and totally equipped. She's one of a kind. What am I saying? You make a move and God will make a move. You do the natural and God will do the supernatural. Some of you tonight, you're stuck in your comfort zone. You're a fully loaded person using about 10% of what God has given you. I want to stir you out of complacency. If you're not uncomfortable every once in a while, then you're not really using your faith. Faith is all about stretching. That obstacle, that challenge, that opportunity, it may look intimidating, but God would not have presented you with it if he didn't already know that you have what it takes. Dare to stretch. I would rather try and fail every once in a while than have to come to the end of my life and wonder what would have happened if I'd have taken that risk. Now, a lot of people are living in the safe zone, but I want to get you over into the faith zone. That's where you see God do amazing things. One time in the scripture, a city was about to be destroyed. The angel told Lot to go to a certain place, but Lot wasn't moving fast enough. So the angel said, hurry, Lot, I can't do anything until you get there. I believe God is saying that to each one of us. I can't move in your life like I want to. I can't release my favor in a greater way until you get where you're supposed to be. It may not even be somewhere physically, but in our thoughts, in our mind, we cannot go around with low self-esteem thinking that we don't have what it takes. No, we have to think like we're fully loaded. Think like you're totally equipped. We can't have the attitude that my business will probably never make it in this economy, or I lost so much in the stock market, I'll probably never recover. Joel, I got laid off. I don't think I'll ever get another job. No, you are a fully loaded person. That means when one door closes, God's gonna open up another door. That setback is not a surprise to God. He had the solution before you even had the problem. He has already armed you with strength for every battle. You need to pack up and move over into faith. God is saying to you what he said to Lot. Hurry up and get there so I can show you my favor in a greater way. I heard a story about a five-year-old boy. He loved the piano. Anytime that he got a chance, he would sit down and piddle around. He'd never had lessons or any kind of formal training. He was often told that he was too small, too young to play the piano. But in spite of those comments, he continued to practice and practice. The only song he knew how to play was Chopsticks. Just a very simple tune, but he played it again and again. One day, his father surprised him. He got tickets for them to go to the symphony and hear this world-renowned Italian pianist. This man was one of the greatest piano players that had ever lived. As they were walking to their seats there in the auditorium, the little boy saw the beautiful grand piano behind the curtain. While no one noticed, he snuck over and sat down on the piano bench and began to play his elementary version of Chopsticks. About that time, the curtain began to rise. Everyone was thinking they were gonna see this world-famous master pianist. Instead, they saw a little boy hunched over the piano playing Chopsticks. He was so caught up in his world, he didn't know anybody was watching. When he realized what was happening, he was petrified. Just as he was about to get up and run for his life, he felt two big arms reaching around him with the hands landing on the piano keys. It was the master pianist. He whispered in the little boy's ear, keep playing. As the little boy continued to play, his simple rendition of Chopsticks, this world-renowned pianist began to play a Beethoven symphony piece that was scored in the same cadence and the same key. Under the direction of the master, he brought the rest of the orchestra in. First, he brought in the woodwinds, then the brass, then the percussion. The boy's father sat there with tears coming down his cheeks, couldn't believe what he was hearing. He never dreamed that simple tune that he heard in his living room each day would no longer sound like Chopsticks, but now it would become a full, beautifully orchestrated Beethoven symphony. What was the difference? The master stepped in. And sometimes in life, you may not feel like you have the talent, the wisdom, the know-how. The good news is God does. When you use what you have, the master will step in. He'll put his hands on top of your hands. He'll take what you think is very average, average gifts, average talent, average ability, but when the master steps in, he'll put his super with your natural and supernatural things will begin to happen. Like that little boy, you'll be amazed. You'll think, I know what I normally sound like. I know what I'm capable of. How did I end up like this? Here's how, the master stepped in. I remember when I first started ministering 10 years ago, my first few sermons were so basic and so elementary. Like this little boy, I'm sure they sounded about like Chopsticks. And don't you say amen. I had never really ministered before, but I was doing the best that I could using what God had given me. The negative thoughts bombarded my mind, saying, Joel, you don't have what it takes. You're not a minister. You're too shy. You're too quiet. You better stay in your safe zone. I had to keep shaking those thoughts off and reminded myself that I am a fully loaded person. I'm anointed, I'm equipped, I'm talented. I can do all things through Christ. What happened? The master stepped in. God put his hands on my hands. He put his voice in my voice. I discovered talent in me that I didn't even know I had. If you would have told me 10 years ago that one day I'd be ministering in Yankee Stadium, I would have said, yeah, right. And you can land an airplane safely in the Hudson River. Friends, when the master steps in, supernatural things are gonna happen. Some of you think that you could never accomplish your dreams. You think you don't have the talent, the resources, the connections. You may not, but know this, God does. As you take steps toward your destiny, God is going to show up. You have to put a demand on your faith. If you play it safe all the time, you'll never really know what's on the inside. I believe in the coming days, as you stretch your faith, you're going to see the master step in. You're going to have a courage to do things that you wouldn't do before. You're gonna discover an ability that you didn't even know was in you. God is going to take your natural and mix his super with it, and instead of just playing chopsticks like the little boy, God's gonna bring in the percussion. That means you're gonna get supernatural breaks. Just when you thought it couldn't get any better, God's gonna bring in the brass. That is the right people. Then the woodwinds, that's the right opportunity. Before long, you're gonna be hitting on all cylinders. It's gonna sound like a beautiful orchestra. That buried treasure is gonna come out, and you're gonna know like I know. This is not just my talent. This is not just my ability. This is the master joining in. This is God taking my ordinary and making it extraordinary. I read a story about a police officer. She patrolled a very rough area of town. She always had a desire to help children learn how to read. In fact, she was the oldest of 12 children. She was the one that taught all of her brothers and sisters how to read. When she would get called to these troubled homes, so often she would notice how there were never any children's books, nothing for the kids to read, and this just broke her heart. She wanted to do something about it, but what could she do? She had limited resources, but instead of giving up and thinking it would never happen, she just kept hoping, kept praying, kept believing. One night, she answered a false alarm at this huge warehouse. When she flipped the lights on, she saw thousands of children's books just waiting to be destroyed. They were brand new, but they had a little imperfection and they were going to be discarded. She said, when I saw those books, I knew they were mine. She asked the owner right then and there if she could have them. He said, fine, they're all yours. That night, dropped into her hands were over 10,000 brand new children's books. One Saturday afternoon, she and the other officers went through the low-income neighborhoods, passed out every single book. Now, when she patrols her area, she constantly sees kids sitting on the sidewalk, sitting on the front porch, reading these children's books. What happened? The master stepped in. God made a way where it looked like there was no way. The scripture says that no good thing will God withhold when you walk uprightly. That means as you live a life of excellence and integrity, a life that's pleasing to the Lord, God is going to bring your dreams to pass. He's going to cause you to be at the right place at the right time. You're going to find yourself even stumbling into God's blessings. Dare to dream big, think big, believe big. You are a fully loaded person. You are totally equipped. Like this lady, you may not have the resources right now, but that's okay, God does. And as you take steps toward your divine destiny, God is going to release more of his favor. Don't be surprised when things fall into place. That's not a lucky break. That's not a coincidence. That's the master stepping in. Don't be surprised when you have wisdom beyond your years, when you get breaks you didn't deserve, when you accomplish more than you thought possible. That's God putting his hand on your hands. That's the master breathing in your direction. We have a friend that told a story about her mother-in-law. As a little girl, this mother-in-law always had a desire to sing. Her dream was to one day become an opera singer. She was extremely talented. All through junior high and high school, she was the one chosen to play the lead in the class plays. But when it came time for college, her parents said, you'll never make a living as an opera singer. That's not a good idea. You need to get a normal degree. They kind of talked her out of what she felt in her heart. She went on and got her degree and lived a happy and a blessed life. When she was 90 years old, she was living in a senior citizen's home. Her husband had gone to be with the Lord and her mind was not as sharp as it should be. She suffered a little from dementia. But what's interesting is every day in the senior's home, she would stand in front of all the people and sing the most beautiful opera you could ever imagine. She sounded like an angel. In fact, people came from all over just to hear this 90-year-old woman sing. What was that? She had buried treasure on the inside. Her gift had been pushed down for nearly 90 years, but it was still alive, just waiting to be released. My challenge to you is don't die with the music still in you. Share your gift with this world. You can go further than you think. You can accomplish more than you've accomplished. No matter what you've gone through, no matter how long it's been, your seeds of greatness are still alive and well. You can still become everything that God has created you to be. My prayer for each one of you is that before you leave this earth, all of your potential will be released. Not one dream, not one gift, not one promise, not one God-given desire will go left unfulfilled. I'm calling back those seeds that you've let go of, those family members you've given up on, those dreams you pushed aside. I'm calling them back tonight. Some of you, you don't realize it, but you can't die yet. You've got too much left in you. You've got too much potential. God is not going to let that go to waste. You might as well put up that rocking chair. It's not time to retire. It's time to refire. You need to get ready. God is gonna give you new opportunities and more time to share your gift with the world. I recently read about a 93-year-old woman that just graduated from college. If she can do it at 93, you and I can do it at 20, at 40, at 60, at 80. Get your fire back. The moment you quit planning for your future is the moment you quit living. The day you quit being excited about what God has in store is the day you went from living to just breathing. You need to have the right attitude, have the right vision for your life. You are a fully loaded person, totally equipped. And if you will learn to stretch your faith, refuse to die with the music still in you, here's what's gonna happen. The master's gonna step in. That means you're gonna get breaks that you didn't deserve. You're gonna overcome obstacles that looked insurmountable. You're gonna accomplish more than you ever thought possible. When you come to the end, you'll be able to say, I finished my course. I've spent all my potential. I've released all my gifts. I've fulfilled my God-given destiny. Amen. Do you receive that tonight? I know you do. Sometimes life can make you feel like you were just living in the dark. Even your prayers don't feel like they're making it to heaven, but God is listening and his light is about to shine. We know God is all powerful, that he can answer any prayer, but sometimes we don't know what to pray. We don't think we deserve God's goodness. Maybe we're inconveniencing him or he has more important things to deal with, but God is concerned about every detail of your life. He's waiting to hear your prayers.
