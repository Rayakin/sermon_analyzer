As you open your Bibles to Luke chapter 22, let me just say what a joy it is to be back home. Three weeks ago I was here leading the service, had the joy of leading the service of Mike McKinley preaching from 1 Peter chapter 1, you may remember that. But then I headed out that night and the last two Sundays I had been elsewhere. Two Sundays ago, Ryan Townsend was at Bangkok City Baptist Church in Thailand and I had the joy of listening to Zane Pratt preach at Gospel City Church in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. And then last Sunday we were together in Singapore at Eugene Lowe's Church, Grace Baptist Church, where I had the joy to preach from Matthew chapter 9. Well now we're back here, good to be back home, we're in Luke, once again we're in Luke chapter 22 and some of you are actually wearing my introduction. Let me explain what I mean. Let me give you the basic line of thought of approaching this passage in Luke 22. It's a famous passage beginning at verse 7 about the Last Supper. Many many volumes of Christian theology have been written out of the verses that we're looking at this morning. But I think if we take an overview of it we'll see that both the Old Testament Passover, that we heard Brittany read about earlier from Exodus 12, and the New Testament Lord's Supper can be illustrated on one level by a wedding ring. So some of you are wearing a wedding ring. Just think of it for a moment. The Lord's Supper is like the Passover, in fact the Last Supper, which we're looking at here in Luke's Gospel, was a Passover meal. What are all of these things that we mentioned but signs? Of course a sign is never as important as what it signifies. We respect the symbol as a part of our respect for what it symbolizes. So for example in the Old Testament God teaches about His holiness by food requirements, by regulations about ceremonial cleanness in worship at the tabernacle in the temple, which physically separated the most holy place from the unholy worshipers. So the Lord's Supper symbolizes, it's done in memory of Christ's death and what he was doing in his death and is a proclamation of his return. The Supper helps to make present those events of the past and the future. So the illustration, if you have a wedding ring or someone around you does, just look at it for a moment, if you're not around somebody just remember when you've seen. The wedding ring shows us that the same thing can make you look back and look forward. You look back and you remember the promises made one certain day and then you look forward through the days and weeks and months to come and you anticipate those promises continuing to be fulfilled. You can remember a promise. At the Passover the Israelites remembered God's deliverance of them from slavery in Egypt and they looked forward to the Messiah's future deliverance of them completely, particularly as the prophets through the Old Testament period added prophecy after prophecy, promise after promise to God's provision for his people. At the Lord's Supper Christians remember Christ's body being broken and his blood being poured out to establish a new covenant for sinners with God and we look forward to the return of the King and the final and full establishment of God's kingdom celebrated by feasting with Christ as we rule and reign with him. That's what Paul says in the next chapter in 1 Corinthians from what we read over in 1 Corinthians chapter 11 verse 26 for as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. Well all of this is in our text this morning as we come to the last evening Jesus had with his disciples before he was executed. Our text is Luke chapter 22 verses 7 to 38. If you're using the Bibles provided it's found on page 881. Listen with me there now, listen as I read. Then came the day of unleavened bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. So Jesus sent Peter and John saying go and prepare the Passover for us that we may eat it. They said to him where will you have us prepare it. He said to them behold when you've entered the city a man carrying a jar of water will meet you follow him into the house that he enters and tell the master of the house the teacher says to you where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples and he will show you a large upper room furnished prepare it there. And they went and found it just as he had told them and they prepared the Passover. And when the hour came he reclined at table and the apostles with him and he said to them I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. For I tell you I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God. And he took a cup and when he had given thanks he said take this and divide it among yourselves for I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes. And he took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and gave it to them saying this is my body which is given for you do this in remembrance of me. And likewise the cup after they had eaten saying this cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood. But behold the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table. For the son of man goes as it has been determined but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed. And they began to question one another which of them it could be who was going to do this. A dispute also arose among them as to which of them was to be regarded as the greatest and he said to them the kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them and those in authority over them are called benefactors but not so with you rather let the greatest among you become as the youngest and the leader as one who serves for who is the greater the one who reclines at table or one who serves is it not the one who reclines at table but I am among you as the one who serves you are those who have stayed with me in my trials and I assign to you as my father assigned to me a kingdom that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel Simon Simon behold Satan demanded to have you that he might sift you like wheat but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail and when you have turned again strengthen your brothers Peter said to him Lord I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death Jesus said I tell you Peter the rooster will not crow this day until you deny three times that you know me and he said to them when I sent you out with no money bag or knapsack or sandals did you lack anything they said nothing he said them but now let the one who has a money bag take it and likewise a knapsack and let the one who has no swords tell his cloak and buy one for I tell you that the scripture must be fulfilled in me and he was numbered with the transgressors for what is written about me has its fulfillment and they said look Lord here are two swords and he said to them it is enough friends this is the vast text we want to look at this morning and consider the things that you're wondering about that I do not answer in the sermon I'll be at that door over there or if you want to save time Bobby will be at that door right there there are other pastors around at the other doors we would happily interact with you about anything that we've not addressed what I want to try to do is pursue with you the main thing in this passage and the main thing in this passage is not the supper it is what the supper points toward it is what Christ said the supper was to function as that is teaching about his death explanation of his death that was to come the supper is the window it's not the glass that we stare at we look through it at the work of Christ done for us so this morning I want you to notice five things that Jesus was going to do at the cross and that he was teaching his disciples about at this last supper they shared let me go ahead and share with you my outline so you can be following along this is the summary at the cross number one and I'm going to repeat this after I do it so that everybody who wants to can take it down number one at the cross Jesus made a new covenant verses 7 to 20 he made a new covenant number two at the cross Jesus submitted to his father's will verses 21 to 23 he submitted to his father's will number three at the cross Jesus reestablished our relationship with God he reestablished our relationship with God that's verses 24 to 30 number four at the cross Jesus suffered for our sins verses 31 to 34 verses 31 to 34 Jesus suffered for our sins and number five Jesus proved the scriptures verses 35 to 38 Jesus proved the scriptures so at the cross Jesus made a new covenant Jesus submitted to his father's will Jesus reestablished our relationship with God Jesus suffered for our sins and Jesus proved the scriptures so let's jump in now and understand what Jesus was doing at the cross and the night before in eating this meal with his disciples which symbolized and explained the significance of his death for them and I pray that as we do you'll understand more of what God is doing in your own life today let's begin with this at the cross number one Jesus made a new covenant look again at those first couple of paragraphs in the first paragraph there Jesus directs his disciples to prepare for observing the Passover the meal together that night I mean even that is amazing to consider if you go back to then what is Jesus doing he is preparing for his own sacrifice this was part of God's plan Jesus knew about the the state of the rooms for them to use he was the Son of God incarnate through the centuries God had ordained the very practices of the Passover specifically in order to prepare his people to understand what Jesus was doing right now so for instance get that in your mind so what what Brittany read us earlier from Exodus 12 those instructions those instructions all those centuries before had been given specifically because of what God himself planned to do through Christ this very time in this night in the day to come that's why those rules those practices were there but the lamb to be slain was to foreshadow the fate of the Lamb of God the Messiah which faith even now is being worked out in Jesus life for those of you who aren't longtime church attenders let me just take a few moments to remember how and why this annual meal of unleavened bread and the Passover lamb how it began and why you go back 1500 years before Jesus the descendants of Abraham had grown into a nation they come through Jacob through Abraham's grandson Jacob to be multiplied and they follow one son Joseph down into Egypt and after a few centuries there the Bible says that multiply greatly and became exceedingly numerous so that the land was filled with them the Pharaohs the rulers of Egypt enslaved the Israelites and oppressed them with forced labor and worked them ruthlessly through some amazing acts of God he raised up Moses and working great wonders he made the Egyptians fear the Israelites and fear their God and even desire to be rid of them but the Pharaoh did not want to lose his labor so God sent an angel of death to kill the firstborn son of all the families and to show conclusively that he was God alone and that it was his will for the Israelites to be freed and that wills to be obeyed and this is where we come to the Passover itself that we read about the judgment for disobedience would befall everyone in Egypt except for God's own people who followed his instructions to prepare to leave they were to make bread in a hurry so they weren't going to be using 11 because they didn't have any time they were to kill a lamb and eat it the loaf and the lamb for the more the lambs blood was to be put around the entry to the house marking all those inside is those for whom the lamb was slain and is those who were therefore to be spared from God's judgment that was about to befall the land and all its inhabitants so the lambs were slain and God's judgment came but it passed over it passed over all the houses marked by the lambs blood did you hear that one of the last verses that we just heard from Exodus chapter 12 verse 13 the blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and no plague will befall you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt the judgment came the firstborn died the Egyptians wailed and mourned and the Pharaoh finally obeyed and let God's people go the Israelites left in the Great Migration called the Exodus and every year at that time they observed such a feast that God had appointed for them to recall God's deliverance of them his ransoming them out of slavery when he had made them his own special people so for centuries the Jews had observed the Passover rituals annually in the month of Nissan in the spring the days of Moses became ancient history as did the days of Joshua and the judges and Samuel and David and Solomon too and the kings and prophets that followed them but through it all the Passover was kept annually in the spring lambs were slain deliverance was remembered faith in God and his provision for his people was encouraged even in the dark days of the people of exile in Babylon they came and went as God removed his people from their land and then restored them to it for hundreds of years after the last of the oldest of prophets of prophesied this annual feast had been faithfully observed partly still in memory of what God had done partly in hope of what God would still do foreigners conquered the land Greeks and Syrians and Romans too it was in the days of the Roman rule that the one came whose life we've been studying Luke's gospel Jesus Christ his family had brought him as a faithful Jewish family to observe the Passover in Jerusalem when he was 12 years old Moses had told them in Deuteronomy 16 to sacrifice as the Passover to the Lord your God an animal from your flock or heard at the place the Lord will choose as a dwelling for his name will that place was Jerusalem where David planned and Solomon had built the temple of the Lord for the Ark of the Covenant was kept in the sacrifices offered now in the last year of his ministry in the last week Jesus would spend with his disciples he began the last day of his incarnate life remember that the Jews counted the beginning of the day at sunset so just as we read Genesis 1 5 and there was evening there was morning the first day so what had been Thursday all day with the going down of the sun becomes Friday night his last Thursday was a special day the day of preparation for the Passover the day on which thousands and thousands of lambs would be offered in sacrifice of the temple of the Lord as the blood flowed the Israelites would bring the meat to groups of 10 or 12 that would have gathered in those family groups to celebrate God's goodness they would gather to remember the first Passover and how God had brought them out of Egypt and slavery and they would hope that God would again deliver them and send them the promised King who would deliver them fully and finally our passage this morning find us on that Thursday of the preparation day and the beginning of that last day of Jesus earthly life the celebration that night of the Passover only what the disciples didn't understand when they prepared the meal or even when they sat down to it would be that this was the last Passover meal and Jesus last meal with them before he would be killed and the first celebration what we come to call the Lord's Supper our regular preview of the great celebration of the marriage supper of the Lamb in verse 14 we read Jesus and the Apostles reclined at table and Jesus said explicitly what he was intending by his coming death is suffering as he called it there at the end of verse 15 this is the suffering that symbolized in the Lord's Supper in verse 16 he seemed to allude to a future meal he would share with him more on that in a moment verse 17 is one of three or four cups they shared during a Passover meal verse 18 makes it clear that this would be Jesus last such meal with them but in verse 19 Jesus reinterprets the Passover turning its focus from deliverance under Moses to the deliverance he was about to undertake for them Jesus was coming to die as he says in verse 20 to make a new covenant but even the supper that night wasn't establishing a new covenant as he said it would be his blood poured out that become the basis for a new arrangement between God and his people a new covenant and no blood was poured out at the table that night Jesus blood continued to circulate in Jesus' body Jesus here to the language of Jeremiah 31 to explain his own death look back at Jeremiah chapter 31 beginning of verse 29 in those days they shall no longer say the fathers have eaten sour grapes and the children's teeth are set on edge but everyone shall die for his own iniquity each man who eats sour grapes his teeth shall be set on edge behold the days are coming declares the Lord when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel in the house of Judah not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt my covenant that they broke though I was their husband declares the Lord for this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days declares the Lord I will put my law within them and I will write it on their hearts and I will be their God and they shall be my people and no longer so each one teaches neighbor and his brother saying no the Lord for they shall all know me from the least of them to the greatest declares the Lord for I will forgive their iniquity and I will remember their sin no more you can make a note to read more about that in Hebrews 8 and 9 this afternoon there's clear explanation about what the Lord is doing there there we read in Hebrews 915 about Christ he is the mediator of a new covenant so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance since the death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions committed under the first covenant in Hebrews 926 he has appeared once for all time at the end of the ages to put away sin but the sacrifice of himself so friends understand very clearly the miracle at the meal that night wasn't transubstantiation a medieval idea first constructed centuries after Jesus the miracle was that the Son of God was there in the flesh proclaiming that at the cross of the pouring out of his blood he was going to bear the penalty for his people's friends what do you think will protect you from God's wrath against you because of your sins what sufficient answer or shield do you have for that good and right the good news is that God has provided such an answer for such an answer to his own righteous demands of us as those made in his image he has sent his only son to be a sacrifice bearing his right and just and good wrath against all who violate his image who don't trust him as he should be trusted Jesus has freely taken on that role has lived a perfect life that we should have lived a life of trust and has died specifically in the place of all of us all of us that would turn and trust in him that's good news he calls you to come to know this forgiveness for your sins through faith in Christ Jesus death on the cross was the sacrifice that ratified this new covenant which was foreshadowed in the Passover of old and all the sin and guilt offerings of the Old Testament but which exceeded and replaced them all all the promises made in the sacrifices in the Old Testament were about to be fulfilled in the sacrifice of Jesus prefigured in this meal set before them that evening Jesus would come in order to die to establish the new covenant at the cross that's the main thing we learn in this passage and the main thing we learn specifically about what Jesus was doing at the cross but Jesus also stresses something here at the cross the second thing Jesus submitted himself to his father's will Jesus submitted himself to his father's will look again 21 but behold the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table for the son of man goes as it has been determined but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed and they began to question one another which of them it could be it was going to do this in verse 22 Jesus reference to the son of man is a reference to himself and then the verb goes the son of man goes is a reference to the course of events particularly in this matter of his blood being poured out on the cross but see how he describes it here as it has been determined this is the same idea we're going to run into our next study in Luke's gospel when we come to his prayer on the Mount of Olives when Jesus is praying there to his father and he refers to the cup of his suffering that he was about to drink in the prayer not my will but yours be done that was a personalized form and application of the very prayer he had earlier taught his disciples to pray our father in heaven your will be done the apostle Peter would actually would would echo the same language soon after Jesus resurrection and ascension in his sermon at Pentecost in which Peter next to 23 referred to this Jesus delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God so this night at his last supper Jesus taught that his crucifixion and even the betrayal that led to it was a part of that which had been determined have been determined by whom by the one who Jesus addressed down in verse 42 as father by God himself now understandably the disciples that evening were shocked by Jesus statement that he would go to his death in some sense by the betrayal of one of them but keeping our eyes steadily on that we cannot fail to notice his language of it having been determined insisting on it as the sovereign plan of God throughout now if your mind is immediately surrounded by questions of how is Judas responsible if God is sovereignly determined this those are great questions which I am right now about to not answer but I remind you of a series of four sermons we had earlier this year on Job chapter three the three on Job three and an overview sermon of Job I would encourage you if you're really wondering those things go and listen to the sermons on Job chapter three and particularly that overview sermon where we look at Job one and two where I think we see a more extended treatment of exactly this question but friends for our purposes now just see the incarnate son of God faced the temptation to send to make his will different from his heavenly father's will consider again next time when we come Jesus prayer after this on the Mount of Olives but in the language Jesus used here at the supper he is insistent on seeing all this as the determined plan of God and it is a plan that he is fully planning on submitting to and bringing to pass and not seeing the new covenant established by the pouring out of his blood of course in verse twenty two that man that man that's Judas and Judas was responsible for his terrible betrayal of Jesus we thought that's but by that some in our sermon last time we considered how sinisterly important Judas was because the Romans had the power and authority in an earthly sense to kill Jesus but Jerusalem's religious leaders were the ones who wanted Jesus dead and they had no power to do it they needed Roman power for that and they would need to deliver Jesus to the Roman authorities quickly and they were nervous about the crowds destabilizing the situation so they seem to understand the need to act quietly and in secret in getting Jesus but to do that they would have to know how to find Jesus apart from the crowd and that meant they needed knowledge they didn't have they needed insider knowledge and that's where Judas comes in he was the key to the religious leaders bringing their plans to pass the friends don't misunderstand the cross would not be some human tragedy derailing God's attempts to sending a Messiah to deliver his people it would instead be the very means of God using even the most crooked of sticks a greedy lying hypocrite of a disciple so-called teachers of God's law in fact conspiring to kill his son occupying Roman forces that would value short-lived peace and order over justice and righteousness in killing an innocent man all of these crooked sticks would be taken up and used sovereignly by God for his good purposes look at the believers prayer in Acts chapter 4 Acts chapter 4 not that long after this evening we're looking at see how they summarize in prayer this action beginning at chapter 4 beginning verse 24 Acts 4 beginning verse 24 and when they heard it they lifted their voices together to God and said sovereign Lord who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them through the mouth of our father David your servant said by the Holy Spirit why did the Gentiles rage in the people's plot in vain the kings of the earth set themselves in the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his anointed for truly in this city they were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus whom you anointed both Herod and Pontius Pilate along with the Gentiles and the people of Israel to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place very much again like Job chapter 1 if you want to think more about this thorny question this prayer at chapter 4 could be helpful for you to meditate on later you see that there is real responsibility that Judas had real responsibility his disobedience in this passage though shouldn't distract us from Jesus' obedience which is the main thing in these verses brothers and sisters I pray that we can find that same trust in God to inspire that same kind of complete obedience today the son perfectly submitted himself to his heavenly father at the cross that's the big news more than the means which got him there the betrayal of Judas at the cross number three Jesus re-established our relationship with God at the cross Jesus re-established our relationship with God look again at our passage beginning with verse 24 a dispute also arose among them as to which of them was to be regarded as the greatest and he said to them the kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them and those in authority over them are called benefactors but not so with you rather let the greatest among you become as the youngest in the leader is one who serves for who is the greater one who reclined at table or one who serves is it not the one who reclined at table but I am among you as one who serves you are those who have stayed with me in my trials and I assigned to you as my father assigned to me a kingdom that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel I have gotten more comments this week in emails from you about this than anything else people wondering why did they go into this discussion about greatness right after he said that someone would betray him one of them would betray him well friends I agree it seems like a strange time I just want to point out that Luke doesn't say that this is when this discussion happened very interesting he simply says there were twenty four a dispute also arose among them and when we look at the parallel accounts in Mark and Matthew they don't mention this dispute going on right now they don't mention this dispute happening after Judas has been pointed out in Jesus' words they both record it but they record it as having happened a few days before Luke 2 records an argument like this is already having happened back in chapter 9 apparently the disciples tended to fall into these disputes about who was the greatest among them about status comparatively Luke references that here I think to contrast the supreme greatness of the supreme servant Jesus Christ as he comes down to his supreme active service to lay down his life as a ransom for many with the kind of greatness that was expected of a promised Messiah Messiah they thought would lead to military conquest political independence but that's the world's expectation that's what the disciples have reflected in their own discussions of human greatness that's why I think Luke recounts the discussion here the most amazing thing here though is that statement that stretched across verses 28, 29, 30 about the disciples eating and drinking at my table in my kingdom though he's going to die Jesus was confident of his ultimate victory he's just said one of their number would betray him and according to John's gospel in John 1330 we see Judas left at that point as John remembered the drama of the night John records after receiving the morsel of bread Judas immediately went out and it was night but of these disciples in front of Jesus that night sharing his table though they would shrink away from him in the coming hours and Peter would even deny him still because what Jesus was doing by sacrificing himself on the cross the relationship of all of us sinners including these very disciples including many of us here today those of us who are his disciples who are sinners yes but repenting sinners and trusting in him that relationship with God would be reestablished and so reestablished here Jesus could paint the picture of a joyful future feasting together at his table in his kingdom forever as Marcus alone has put it so memorably the voice that spells forgiveness will say you may go you have been let off the penalty which is things deserve but the verdict which means acceptance will say you may come you are welcome to all my love and my presence for the all access pass purchased by Jesus for those of us who trust in him who repent of our sins and put our faith in him we are the ones who trust in the one who is poured out his blood for many for the forgiveness of sins this is a fellowship between God and man that's reestablished here that he accomplished at the cross the Passover meal began to take on more explicit aspects of what revelation 99 calls the marriage supper of the lamb the final feast that we share together in the presence of God we are promised to eat and drink in Christ's table even to be rulers with him brothers and sisters we have a great future ahead of us in Christ all because of Christ's work on the cross Christ reestablishing our relationship with God at the cross that's what's going on here another thing that we can see from this account of the cross number for Jesus suffered for our sins Jesus suffered for our sins look again at verses 31 to 34 verses 31 to 34 Simon Simon behold Satan demanded to have you that he might shift you like wheat but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail and when you have turned against strength in your brothers Peter said to him Lord I'm ready to go with you both to prison and to death Jesus that I tell you Peter the rooster will not grow this day until three times you denied that you know me my dear wife always says about me always confident sometimes right she knows me well we might say the same about Peter what are you this morning are you confident are you right in your confidence what relationships do you have in place that will help to undo the distortions a wrong confidence might bring your own life brothers and sisters be encouraged by the fact that God uses repentance centers how heartening is this account he's so clear with Peter here he not only predicts Peter's denial but implicitly predicts Peter's repentance and beyond that he exhorts Peter to have a ministry of strengthening his brothers friends in this church we recognize that Satan's all-time work is to accuse the brethren he does it all the time sometimes the accusations are true sometimes the accusations are false but to accuse the brethren is what he does it is work what a comfort it is to know that Jesus is powerfully interceding for us today if we are his own even as he did for Peter Paul's words in Romans 834 who is to condemn Christ is the one who died more than that he was raised who is at the right hand of God who indeed is interceding for us Romans 834 that wasn't a special perk merely of Peter alone that's the perk of all of us who are of his people his chosen people that Jesus was about to die for were sinners in fact he was dying for them because they were sinners these particular men were sinners Peter the leader of all the disciples had agreed to sin that he was just about to commit coming up in fact commit three times all of the disciples would forsake Jesus that wasn't just Peter you look down and look after twenty two looked at the betrayal and arrest of Jesus later that night you see that paragraph forty seven to fifty three well Matthew in his account adds one more sentence at the end of it then all the disciples left him and fled wasn't just Peter Peter did that but so did everybody else at the cross Jesus didn't just show us the way but he made himself the way for sinners Jesus denying sinners like Peter he made a way to believe in him to turn again after sin to be forgiven by this one because of the one who at the cross had suffered for our very sins can you imagine a more sufficient savior if you've got something better to do all right but if you don't this afternoon read first Peter short letter and just think of the man who wrote this letter he had this encounter with Jesus and then he writes these words in chapter one of first Peter is how he expresses other believers knowing that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers not with perishable things such as silver or gold but with the precious blood of Christ that's not a merely a theological image that's a man he knew with the precious blood of Christ that's a man it is crucial hour he denied knowing I remember one friend telling me of the guilt he felt as a teenager having a sadly typical teenage exchange with his father father dropping off at school he yells at him some terrible phrase like dad I hate you he gets the call during the day that his father died of a heart attack the timing of Peter's denial couldn't be worse it's the very time where Jesus is going to die for us doing things like denying him and yet Peter can write about the precious blood of Christ Paul summarizes to the believers in Corinth I delivered you the first important what I also received that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures didn't just suffer for our sins in the sense that humans like us betrayed him and denied him it's not just that the sins of humans like us led him to the cross though we were the circumstances for that but paying the debt of our sins substituting himself for us as the object of God's right wrath was Jesus motivation for going to the cross in that sense Jesus died for us he died for our sins it was the love that Jesus had for sinners like Peter that would let him look at this disciple boasting of courage who was in fact a coward and tell him of his defense of Peter against Satan's demands and of his prayer for Peter and of such confidence in Peter's future repentance that he didn't even look past this coming denial and encourage Peter in a future envisioned ministry of strengthening his brothers friends can you imagine such a love for someone who is wrong you and you and I all deserve to be wrong sometimes but from one like Jesus is never been anything other than perfectly good perfectly righteous perfectly loving to be treated as Peter did and yet to then be able to look on Peter with such love such grace such mercy towards people like us people who have sinned against him as Peter did our sins were the reason Jesus would suffer so at the cross and his suffering would be sufficient that blood of the covenant poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins would not fail to achieve its end at the cross Jesus substitutionary suffering would so fulfill the laws demands the demands of God's own righteousness that sinners like Peter and like you and like me could be welcomed forever into God's presence no longer enemies but now friends adopted and beloved all because of Jesus God's wrath and justice satisfying death on the cross praise the Lord for who it is that has loved us and for how he has loved us one more thing to notice that Jesus was teaching that he would do it the cross number five Jesus proved the scriptures true Jesus proved the scripture to look again at verse thirty five and he said to them when I sent you out with no money bag or knapsack or sandals did you lack anything they said nothing he said to them but now let the one who has a money bag take it and likewise a knapsack and let the one who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one for I tell you that this scripture must be fulfilled in me and he was numbered with the transgressors for what is written about me has its fulfillment and they said look Lord here are two swords and he said to them it is enough to scripture that must be fulfilled referring to here is back in Isaiah chapter fifty three turn their Isaiah chapter fifty three look at the last two verses of this now famous chapter Isaiah fifty three beginning in verse eleven out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied by his knowledge shall the righteous one my servant make many to be accounted righteous and he shall bear their iniquities therefore I will divide him a portion with the many and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he poured out his soul to death and was numbered with the transgressors that's the bit Jesus sites that he bore the sin of many and makes intercession for the transgressors what Jesus is saying here in the somewhat enigmatic verses is that the Messiah of Israel would be himself in his own body made an offering for the guilt of his people this is not how the nation of Israel had been thinking of the Messiah that was to come they had imagined a less radical problem and needing a less radical solution they thought they needed something merely military merely political they didn't realize that their own sins had so alienated them from their Holy Creator that they were piling up for themselves God's righteous judgments that would sink them forever and their only hope was a righteousness as big and complete and perfect as Jesus is the only perfect righteousness in our fallen world enough to be numbered with the transgressors treated like them that is even though he was not one righteous enough that he could carry the sin of many and pray effectually for all of us who would trust in him even as he had earlier prayed for Peter and so spared him the spiritual destruction that he deserved and that Satan desired for him that is what the scripture said would happen that the servant of the Lord the servant of the Lord would be ironically unjustly numbered with the transgressors and yet by being so counted and treated as a transgressor by that very crucifixion he would bear the sin of many and Jesus would once again show the accuracy and the reliability and the trustworthiness and the truth of even the most surprising prophecies in the Bible how would the servant of Yahweh be numbered with the transgressors this is what was happening at the cross the servant of the Lord was numbered with the transgressors the other language here in these verses in verses 35 and 36 in verse 38 seem to be about the hostility that Jesus followers were about to face so Jesus who had just entered Jerusalem triumphantly to shout and cheers days before was about to be rejected with shouts and jeers as a transgressor and if the disciples continue to follow him they had better be prepared for a sea change and what was going to be like when the 72% out earlier they didn't need to take anything because people were glad to have them care for them but it would not be like that going forward a persecution would follow even as it had followed Jesus himself to the cross so Jesus here is giving his would-be followers a sharp warning that they cannot deify themselves and ungod Jesus by demanding comfort and popular acceptance if they're going to follow Jesus they can't demand those things that Jesus himself did not receive not if they're going to follow him just as Jesus was about to be rejected so if they truly recognize him for who he was they would have to be willing to lay down their own lives and following him they were just hours away from experiencing this in the temple officers of the crowd with swords and clubs mentioned down in verse 47 and following Romans 817 Paul wrote that we are heirs with Christ provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him. Paul knew something of such sufferings for following Christ didn't he? He writes to the Corinthians about imprisonments with countless beatings often near death. He goes on and states that for the sake of Christ and I am content with weakness, insults, hardships, persecutions and calamities. One of the joys of the travels I've just had was seeing various friends who've been members here who now live in India, Malaysia, across Southeast Asia and even East Asia. Just this morning getting a text from one of those pastors who used to be in the internship program here who's in a large country in East Asia where his church has been being harassed people being threatened to be taken away because they're meeting regularly. But friends this is not finally surprising to him because he reads his Bible and he sees what Jesus taught his own followers. So if we would like a religion in which there is no persecution we need a different religion. Our Savior went to the cross. If we would follow him our lot is not only suffering. It's not like a Buddhist entire self-abnegation. It's not at all what Christianity teaches but there is a period of time in which yes we die to self because we trust that God then gives us new life in Christ. We follow Christ and we take the opposition that Christ faced. Jesus proved the scripture true even as he died on the cross. What the scripture predicted would happen. Friends this is a rich passage. We have just scratched the surface but we should conclude. The Lord's Supper which we intend to celebrate together next Sunday night. So go ahead and mark that on your calendar. Change some plans if you need to. We do it each month. We do that in obedience to Christ's command here to do it in remembrance of Christ. Jesus taught here in verse 19. The point of the supper isn't the supper. That's why this hasn't been a sermon on the supper. The point of the supper is the cross and all that Christ was to achieve in it which he taught us by means of the supper. Over 500 years ago this coming Tuesday God kindly used the reformation to stop many from staring blankly and blindly at the window of the mass and to look through it to what Jesus said the Lord's Supper was to do to cause his people to remember his death. You see for many years in many countries distorted symbols of Christ's death. A butchered celebration of the supper where the cup was never given to the people. It was told that virtue came by seeing the host the victim elevated. Bleeding statues, fanciful sermons, Luther mocked said about blue ducks. Things that were just made up. Mangled the gospel even in so-called Christian churches. God used Martin Luther among others to have a single-eyed focus on the question of how he a sinner could be declared okay by and with God and the answer was only through faith in Christ and what he had done on the cross. Only through the very message set forth at the supper. As the message was recovered new life broke out and the news of it spread. For the first time in too long people were being told that they could know that they were forgiven by God. For centuries people who came to churches that thought of themselves as Christians were told that it was a sin to believe you could confidently know that you were forgiven and in a state where you could know that you would be accepted by God. But now they began to be taught the scriptures and they could see that they could know this not because of their own righteousness but because of the righteousness of Christ that was given to them. This was glorious news and it turned towns and cities and whole countries upside down and this message of forgiveness of sins through faith in Christ has never been fully eclipsed since then and it comes down to us today as we read the Bible in our own language. Even us doing that here today is a result of that reformation and as we study it together every Sunday more fruit of the reformation that we have sermons like this. As we have the Lord's Supper next Sunday night more fruit of the reformation. That was not happening before the reformation and so in our individual lives as we hear testimonies like Clark's last Sunday. As we hear what God has done in our lives we are changed forever because of Jesus Christ and what he did at the cross. Do you see that? Do you see all that the supper is beginning to show us? Listen now to this great hope captured in the words of our final hymn. You'll find it on page 15 in your bulletin. Arise my soul arise. Shake off thy guilty fears. The bleeding sacrifice in my behalf appears. Before the throne my surety stands. That is my promise. Before the throne my surety stands. My name is written on his hands. Five bleeding wounds he bears. The hands, the feet, the side. Received on Calvary. They poor effectual prayers. They strongly plead for me. Forgive him oh forgive they cry. Nor let that ransomed sinner die. The father hears him pray. His dear anointed one. He cannot turn away the presence of his son. His spirit answers to the blood and tells me I am born of God. My God is reconciled. His pardoning voice I hear. He owns me for his child. I can no longer fear. With confidence I now draw nigh and father, Abba, father cry. Let's stand and sing together.
