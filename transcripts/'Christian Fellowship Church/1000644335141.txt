Thank you very much. Good morning. If Liverpool are listening, I'll do it for half what you're playing, J端rgen. I'll take a pay cut and I'll do it for you. Absolutely. Yeah, a bit of a shock that J端rgen is leaving. But there we are. Life goes on, right? And absolutely, it's in God we trust. Sometimes in Anfield they'll say, in J端rgen we trust. Well, I love him, but not that much. And I don't trust in J端rgen, I trust in Jesus. And it's because of Jesus that I will never walk alone. Come on, see what I did there? Marvelous. It's marvelous to be with you. I love being back in Belfast, of course, city of my birth, which I love passionately. But also, I love coming to CFC. I'm genuinely, I feel honored and humbled to be part of your journey. I love the fact that you just keep inviting me back, which is great. And I do appreciate that. And I feel so honored and encouraged to be part of it. We've had a wonderful weekend together. Well, at least I've enjoyed it. Those that have been part of the conference have probably endured a little bit of that, but I've enjoyed that. And that's been a great, great subject. And I've been staying in the Stormwood Hotel, and looking across the road, it's been nice to see some lights on. Something's clearly going on across the road. I wasn't sure what it was, but there we are. Something's going on across the road. May God have mercy on us and help us as a nation. And we look to him in his providential love and care. And I loved Richard's prayer, and I would resonate with all of that. So you ready for a bit of the Bible? Is that okay? We're gonna lean in. We've got a packed house this morning. Welcome all those online. The people eating buns and cakes downstairs, pretending to be worshiping with us at the same time. I hope you're enjoying this as well. And so we are going to lean into the word of God. Now, as Richard said, we did this little conference over the weekend. Now, if you weren't part of that, don't switch off. But what I try to do when we do a bit of a conference like this, if you've been to the weekend and I try to do something on a Sunday morning that'll sort of land some of the ideas in a nice way for you to help you. If you haven't been part of that, don't switch off, because what I'm gonna say this morning is a bit of a standalone as well, but it all connects together, if that makes sense to you. And we've been looking at this idea, I think it's on the screen for you, yeah, truth on trial. And thinking about truth on trial, we've been leaning into the temptations of Jesus. And we've sort of looked at four key areas, a question of identity, a question of authority, a question of clarity, and then a question of security. And that's been a sort of a progressional journey, thinking about the power of the word of God in our lives as followers of Jesus. So this morning, I wanna lean into the idea of a question of value, a question of value. So if you've got a Bible with you or you wanna follow a reading, I'm gonna take two readings from the Gospel of Luke. And I'm gonna read from Luke chapter two. Now, if you're just joining us online and you hear me reading these, you may think you've dropped into a parallel universe and think, is it Christmas already? Because the passages I'm gonna read to you, we traditionally read at Christmastime. And yet, that's a bit of a tragedy, because these passages have something really powerful to say to us. So I'm gonna read from Luke chapter two. We'll do the first reading from verse eight in that little section, and then we'll jump over to verse 41. Now, we'll read these quickly, but it's worth taking our time and reading the passage. So if you don't have a Bible in front of you, just try and listen to what I'm saying. And if you do have a Bible, then why don't you follow with me? So here we go. Luke chapter two, verse eight. And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, do not be afraid, I will bring you good news that will cause great joy for all people. Today, in the town of David, a Savior has been born to you. He is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a sign to you. You will find a baby wrapped in clothes and lying in a manger. Suddenly, a great company of the heavenly hosts appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, glory to God in the highest heaven and on earth, peace to those on whom his favor rests. When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about. So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph and the baby who was lying in the manger. When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning him and concerning what had been told about them, about this child, and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. We'll just leave it there, and then we'll skip over to verse 41. We're in the same chapter, but a bit of time has passed. And it says this, every year Jesus' parents went up to Jerusalem for the feast of the Passover. When he was 12 years old, they went up to the festival according to the custom. After the festival was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it. Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends. When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him. After three days, they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers. When his parents saw this, they were astonished. His mother said to him, son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you. Why were you searching for me? He asked. Didn't you know I had to be in my father's house? But they did not understand what he was saying to them. Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart, and Jesus grew in wisdom and stature in favor with God and with men, or people in general. Mary is an amazing woman. I was raised on the Shankill Road in Belfast, and I grew up in a wee Pentecostal church halfway up the Shankill Road, and we didn't talk much about Mary. That's a shame. Now I understand why we didn't talk much about Mary, because the churches on the other side of the wall on the Shankill Road, at the bottom of the Shankill Road, talked about Mary in ways that my wee church was nervous about. So because one section of the community in Northern Ireland maybe treated Mary more than she was, maybe referring to her as the mother of God rather than just the mother of Jesus, in the world that I grew up tragically, we decided our response to that would be don't talk about her. That's just stay away from Mary. What a tragedy that is. What a tragedy that was for me, because Mary is amazing. Mary was an amazing woman of God. She is the mother of Jesus. She is unique. There is no one in human history will ever fill those shoes. Mary is the mother of Jesus. She becomes, as it were, the conduit for God's great plan of incarnation to save the world, and Mary is truly staggering. If you read her story right at the beginning of the Gospel of Luke, I love that Dr. Luke really gives us Mary's story like nobody else's, and some of the detail he's clearly got from Mary because only a woman would remember some of the stuff that is included in that story. It's absolutely gorgeous. Some of the stuff that Mary takes in her stride freaks people like Zechariah out. Zechariah, a priest, is so struck by what God wants to do that actually he's struck dumb in the presence of God because he struggles to believe it. Even Joseph, the man that Mary is betrothed to, needs a bit of dream therapy to get him over the line on this whole issue. What the men in the story of the Nativity struggle with, Mary seems to take in her stride, which is pointing to the fact that this is an amazing woman with a measure of faith. Even the angel Gabriel says, you're favored of God, and I think there's an attractional favor there. She's favored because there's something in Mary that's drawing that favor. And I think when we look closely, we see Mary as a young woman of faith, and a young woman I want to suggest to you also of the Word. I think Mary is summed up in her own response to the angel Gabriel. When the angel Gabriel says to her what God wants to do in her and through her, Mary says these words, behold, the Lord's servant, may it be to me as you have said. Now, that's a better translation. My NIV Bible says, I am God's servant, may it be to me as you have said. But the emphasis there is, behold, I'm the Lord's servant, an echo even of a great Old Testament idea. And Mary says, may it be to me as you've said. She's an amazing, amazing woman. But here's what makes her even more amazing. Not only was she the mother of Jesus, but the Gospel record shows us that she becomes a follower of Jesus. It would be a tragedy if the woman who gave birth to Jesus didn't follow Jesus. Are you there? I don't know if you've ever thought about that before. But hidden in plain sight in the Gospel story, we have two amazing facts about Mary. Not only does she bear Jesus, not only does she become the mother of Jesus, but she progresses from bearing Jesus and becomes a follower of Jesus. Mary is at the resurrection. Mary is around at some of the key moments in Jesus' life. Mary, we believe, is around when the Holy Spirit falls in Pentecost. There's certainly a clear evidence of that in Acts chapter 1 and Acts chapter 2. So Mary isn't just there at the beginning, giving birth to the baby, and then she's out of the story. The woman who gives birth to Jesus becomes a follower of Jesus. She becomes part of this amazing story. The one she gives birth to, she ends up following. And I love that idea, and it's easy to miss it because, well, yeah, Mary's the mother of Jesus, and then we move on. But Mary is also a follower of Jesus. And I think one of the things that makes Mary a follower of Jesus is in the two passages that we've read together. I don't know if you heard it as I was reading it, but there were two almost identical phrases used in our two passages. Let me bring them up for you. It says this in chapter 2, verse 19. After the shepherds sort of bring their news about the angels and all of that and leave, it says this. But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. Wow. So he has this moment of birth. The shepherds have arrived. The story about the angels, and Mary's treasuring this, and she's pondering what's going on. And then in chapter 2, verse 51, we have this phrase. After the encounter with Jesus, Jesus in the temple, eventually finding him after three days in the conversation that follows, it says this. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart. Now I want you to see there, chapter 2, verse 19, chapter 2, verse 51, we have the word treasured. And that's not a coincidence. In fact, if you look a little bit closely at those words in the language that Dr. Luke writes them in, they are essentially the same word. Now, they're not exactly the same. The way Dr. Luke uses the word, it allows the word to be sort of translated in a slightly different way. So the root word is treasured. But the way Dr. Luke uses it in 219, the idea is treasure together. You can check that out, but trust me on that. It's got the sort of nuance of treasuring. Yes, that's there. But treasuring together, holding something together. And the idea there might be a nuance of preserving it, keeping it, watching over it. All right? You're with me? Does that make sense? Okay. It's quiet. All right. And then the second word that's being used of treasured, exactly the same word again, but the way Dr. Luke uses it, the idea here, the picture behind it or the nuance is to protect it, to keep it, to travel with it. So you get two words that in our English Bible look exactly the same, and of course they sort of are. But there's a little nuance in the word that when you read in 219 that she treasured it, the idea is of watching over and preserving it, keeping it together. And then when she protects what she's heard in 251, treasures it, the idea there is of protecting it, even though she doesn't quite understand it. Are you with me? So if we summarize that together, when you put 219 and 251 together, you've got the idea of treasuring to preserve and treasuring to protect. Are you with me? Is that okay? And then something else happens in the passage. Now again, our English Bible, this is a wee bit tricky for us to notice this, but the way Dr. Luke writes it, when he says treasured, he uses a tense in the word, which means to treasure continuously. So Mary doesn't just treasure once in 219, and she just doesn't treasure once in 251. When Mary is treasuring in 219, it is a continuous action. So now when we move on from verse 19, she's still treasuring. When we've forgotten Mary, she's still treasuring. When the story moves on, she's still treasuring. Are you with me? When we move on from Jesus at the temple, the 12-year-old boy, and we're moving into the next bit of the story, in the back story of the gospel, she's still treasuring. She's still treasuring. She's still treasuring. So you get this idea when we combine it all together that Mary, whatever has come to her, she is preserving it, treasuring it by preserving it. She is treasuring it by protecting it, and she's doing it continuously. Now here's a cool thought, which is amazing. These two words, though in the same chapter of Luke, are 12 years apart. You're a hard crowd to impress. That's saying something about Mary. It's hidden in plain sight. It's really easy to miss. We think that when Jesus was born, Mary was probably, in our culture, we would call her a young teenager. Now I know that's a difficult idea for 21st century, but in the world of Israel, when a young woman became a daughter of the law, as it were, she became an adult. So at 13, 14, 15, you were regarded as an adult with adult rights and adult responsibilities. We suspect that at the birth of Jesus, Mary could be as young as 13, 14, even 15 years of age. Is that okay? Now we're not absolutely sure, but there's a good body of conversation that's comfortable with that idea, even if 21st century we're not. You with me? So let's just call it, you can disagree if you want, but at 13, she's treasuring. And when we move on with the story, the 13 year old is continuing to treasure. And at 14, she's still treasuring. And at 15, she's treasuring. And then we meet her 12 years later. So let's imagine she was 13 in 219. At 251, she's now 25. And what do we see her doing? Treasuring. Treasuring. Treasuring. I submit to you that those two ideas 12 years apart are why Mary moved from being mother to follower. The reason Mary is in the upper room when the Holy Spirit comes, because she treasured. Come on. Because she didn't just, oh, that's interesting, and then forget it. Oh yeah, God spoke this morning in CFC. Let's move on. Let's have lunch. Are you with me? Whatever God said to her and whatever way it came to her, she treasured. And she's treasuring as a young teenager, and now she's treasuring in someone maybe in her mid-twenties, and we're now getting a pattern. When you're seeing those ideas, I think Dr. Luke, in his brilliant woman-loving way that he does in the gospel of Luke, I think Luke is saying to us, look at this, look at this, look at this. She's not just the mother of Jesus. She's a treasurer of the Word. And because she's a treasurer of the Word, she becomes a follower of Jesus. And she's not just there at the beginning. She's there at the end. She's not just there when the story starts. She's there when the Holy Spirit comes. She's there. Why? Because she treasured, and she treasured continuously. All of that. But here's the second thing I want you to see. What did she treasure? In the NIV it translates both verses, as she treasured all these things. Now that's a, who am I to argue with wonderful men and women who are supremely much more intelligent than I will be. But I don't like that translation so much. And here's why. Because literally, all these things can read all these words. Mary's not just treasuring things. She's treasuring words, literally, that's what it reads. So when the shepherds come with their conversation, and they leave, what she's treasuring was not just the encounter with the shepherds, but the words that they brought. Here's what the angel said to us, and the shepherds repeat what the angels say. And Mary grabs the words, and treasures the words. And then when Jesus talks as a 12-year-old boy about being about the things of his father, and why you're worried about me, and they clearly didn't quite understand what he was talking about, she didn't throw all of that in the bin. She treasured those words. She grabbed those words. She grabbed those ideas, even though she didn't fully understand it all. She knew that if God has spoken, this is important. Are you with me? Is that okay? Does that make sense to you? And so we put it all together, 219 and 251. Here's what we end up with. Mary preserved and protected all these words continuously. That's why she moves from being mother to follower. That's why she's not just there at the beginning, she's there at the end. Why? Because Mary understands that whether or not I fully understand everything God has said to me, if God has spoken, grab it. Come on, somebody say, oh man. God has spoken to us, grab it. If God has spoken to you, grab it. If God has spoken to CFC, grab it. Grab it. Because when God speaks, it's important. When God speaks, he's not just filling the air with words. God is speaking because in all of his words, there is purpose, there is meaning, there is focus, there is dynamic. There's something in his words that will help us become the people we are meant to be in the world that he wants us to touch and reach. And when God speaks, even if you don't fully understand what he's saying, even if like it's making your head hurt, grab it. Grab it. Treasure it. And like Mary, treasure it continuously. And some of you in this room need to hear the word of the Lord. God spoke to you five years ago, ten years ago, twenty years ago. Treasure it. Well John, it hasn't happened yet. Treasure it. Grab it. Hold it. Because if God has spoken, sooner or later, and if it's twenty years, it's a bit later than sooner, I get that. But sooner or later, God's going to rock up with the answer in the word. And Mary will eventually see things because she treasured. Mary will eventually get something because she treasured. Mary will eventually understand. Mary will eventually see her son she bore as the resurrected Messiah of the world. But she gets to see that because she treasures. God has made promises to CFC. Treasure. Treasure. God has made promises to you. Treasure. Don't allow the enemy to snatch it away. Don't allow the passage of time to snatch it away. Don't allow even disappointment to snatch it away. Or the fact, well John, when's it going to happen? I can't answer that question. That's above my pay grade. But here's what I do know. Here's what I can say to you. Here's what I do believe and understand. If he has spoken, grab it. And why should we grab it? And how should we grab it? Well, we should grab it and treasure it because we need to value his words. Value his words. It's clear from our passages that Mary didn't always understand everything. In 219, there's a wee nuance that says, she treasured and pondered. And then when we get to 251, it's a wee bit more explicit in that in the verse previous, it says these words, but they did not understand what he was saying to them. It's explicit. Okay. We sort of get it, but we don't get it. What's going on here? So in 219, she pondered in her treasuring, which suggests doesn't fully understand everything. And then in 251, that explicitly says they didn't really fully understand, but it didn't stop her treasuring. Why? Why? Because Mary knows if God said it, it's gold. Come on now. Come on. If God said it, it's valuable. If God said it, it's important. And here's the problem we have as humans. When God speaks, we want to understand everything. How's it going to work out? When's it going to work out? What's it going to look like? When's it going to happen? Right? Or is that just me? Right? We want the detail. And I get that. Why not? Of course we want the detail. But there are moments when God speaks to CFC, moments when God speaks to you, moments when God has spoken to you, and actually, you don't really have the details. It's a wee bit fuzzy, but you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, he spoke. You know that. You would put your mortgage on it if you were a betting person, which of course you're not because you're a good follower of Jesus. Are you with me? I mean, I can take you to words in my Bible, I can take you to words that I've literally enshrined on the wall of my study. And I am absolute, I would put everything I own and have on the table and say, God spoke to me. I know. I absolutely know. And yet I'm still a bit fuzzy with the detail. So what do you do in a moment like that? Do you let go of the word because you're fuzzy on the detail? No, no. You grab the word because the word is valuable because it's God's word. He said it. And if he said it, it's gold. Are you with me? Mary is a lover of the word. You know, we just, I think at times we've been very disingenuous to Mary because we sort of look at her as a woman who, please forgive me, don't hear this the wrong way, who simply is the conduit for the birthing of Jesus. It's like God needed a womb and Mary's it. And that's a deeply disingenuous way to think of a woman of God. Because when you look at Mary, we've got a woman of deep faith and a woman of the word. In fact, Mary's song, wow, what a song. If a man came out with that song, wow, we'd all go amazing. Mary's song recorded for us in chapter one of Luke. Sometimes we refer to it as the Magnificat because it's just magnificent. And we've got a teenage girl rocking the Bible. Now here's sometimes how we've read the Magnificat, the song of Mary. It's like, wow, she's just overwhelmed by the spirit of God and like spontaneously words just pop out of her mouth. That's one way to read it and that's cool and I would not fall out with anybody if that's your view. But here's how I read it. The words tumbling out of her mouth are words that are already in her heart. And when you look at the song of Mary, it is absolutely staggering. Now if you were at our conference over the weekend, we talked about how Jesus looked at the Bible, his Bible, what we call the Old Testament. The Hebrew Bible is sort of in three bits. It's one bit but it has like three big sections. It has what we sometimes refer to as Moses or the Torah, the first five books of the Bible and that's like the engine room of the Old Testament. It's like, okay, if you're going to be taken seriously, you got to know Torah. Torah frames everything else in the Bible. You can't understand the prophets or the writings without the Torah. They explain it all and in fact, they nuance everything out of it. And then you've got a prophet section, which sort of does what it says on the tin. That's where most of the prophets live in that section. And then you've got the writings section, which is like ethical, poetical, moral application to the Torah, okay? So the book of Psalms, for example, in the writings, the book of Proverbs, books like that. Are you with me? And David Harvey and I did some work one Christmas on Mary's song and I did some research on her song that I've never done before and I discovered that in Mary's song, she makes 15 references to the Old Testament. 15 references to the Old Testament. I'll break it down for you if it sort of helps you with all of this. In terms of the Torah bit, she references the Torah twice. In terms of the prophets bit, she makes six references and in terms of the writings bit, she makes seven references. Now if you're even prepared to go halfway with me on this, here's what it's showing us. This little song that this little teenager is kicking out is coming out of the depths of a woman who knows the Word of God. This isn't random. This isn't just inspiration. This is inspiration that is touching words and ideas that all are already inside this wonderful, wonderful young woman. And here's what I love about Mary. She doesn't understand it all. She's pondering. She doesn't fully understand everything that Jesus said, but she's smart enough to know this. If God spoke, grab it. Come on. If He's spoken, grab it. Why? Because His words are valuable. They're gold. The psalmist says this, your words are more precious than gold, than much pure gold. They are sweeter than honey, than honey from the comb. Wow. What you value, you watch over. Come on, are you with me? Mary's valuing the words, even though she doesn't understand them all. She's valuing them. Why? Because she understands the words that have come from the mouth of God. If you were with us yesterday, you'll know that little nuance from Deuteronomy. Words that come from the mouth of God, grab it, grab it, grab it. Hold on to it, preserve it, protect it. Are you with me? Does that make sense? I hope it does. When I was younger, I loved Action Man. Now people of a certain age will remember Action Man. If you are sort of under 30, you may need to Google that and check that out. But before computer games, before the internet, we had like stuff that we played with, and I love me Action Man. My parents didn't have much money, but they recognized my passion for Action Man was so strong that every birthday and every Christmas, I got a bit more Action Man stuff. They brought it, and my first Action Man was just like a doll figure, but we didn't use the word doll on the shankle. It was an action figure, all right? My first Action Man was just like an action figure, and you could dress him up in army uniform and underwater uniform and space uniform, you know all that, and play it on. You have Jeeps and tanks and helicopters, and it was amazing. I built this amazing collection, and then they brought out Action Man with moving eyes. He had this little button on the back of his head, and his eyes move like that. That's all he did. That's all it did. They all bought new Action Men because his eyes moved. It's a bit weird, and I love my Action Men, but when I was coming to go to Bible College, I went to Bible College at 17, I still had all me Action Man stuff. My helicopter was in pristine condition. My Jeep, my tank, I mean, they looked like they'd just come out of the box. My uniforms were all like, I'm a bit OCD. So all my uniforms were like ordered in nice order, and everything was in its place. You could just walk into my room, and you could just pick up exactly, all the little bits of equipment were all in one little box. Are you feeling me? All right. I feel the sadness of my life, and why God rescued me by sending me to Bible College. My mommy said to me, she said, son, you probably need to get rid of your Action Man stuff. And I said, why? That probably shows you how sad I was. And my mother said, look, son, there's kids in the area. Why don't you just, why don't you be generous and give it away? And so there's a wee family around the back of us on the Shankill Road, and a wee boy, and I thought he would like this. And I remember packing all my stuff up, and putting it all, and it was just, it was like brand new. And I remember taking it around, wrapping it on the door, and said, would you like this? And the family were overwhelmed. The wee boy was excited. It was like Christmas had come in the middle of summer, and it was all great. And I felt great. Oh, that's marvelous. And I went round to my house, said, mommy, I give that to that wee lad, and I feel good about that. That's wonderful. And go to Bible College now, and be an adult. And then the next day, I was walking, walking around the street, and I passed the house that the wee boy lived in. You know what's coming, don't you? And I wish to this day I hadn't walked past his house. An action man was spread all over the garden. The helicopter was already broken. The tank was sitting out there for anybody to steal. It felt like stealing it myself, actually, at that point. And all that years, and so I'm now 17, about to go off to Bible College. So for 10 years, I have lovingly treasured, and all my treasured was just lying all over the floor. And I remember going home and saying to my mom, you'll never guess what's going on right now. And my mother compassionately, tenderly said, son, you need to get over it, just winds up. And I learned something that day, you can tell I'm still struggling, if there's any psychologists who do it, it'd be great to have a bit of free counseling afterwards. I'm still struggling with that. I learned something that day that actually, what you value, you treasure. What you don't value, you do not treasure. I valued that stuff, and I treasured it. And I handed it over to someone who didn't value it, and they trashed it. Now listen to me very, very carefully. If God's spoken to you, you must treasure it. There's enough people out there who'll do the trashing. It's up to them. But Mary treasured. I don't understand. If you'd have said to Mary as a 13-year-old, do you get all that? If you'd have said to Mary as a 25-year-old, do you understand? But here's what I do know, God spoke, and I'm going to treasure it. We treasure what we value. And ladies and gentlemen, if there's one thing in your world and my world we need to value, it's the Word of God. And I don't just mean the Word of God generically in this beautiful, magnificent, gorgeous book, God-breathed book, but I mean the words that He has spoken to you. Treasure them. Don't allow them to be trashed. Treasure them and hold on to them, because they will come to pass. Here's the second thing really quickly, and I'm drawing to a close. We need to protect His words. And we need to protect His words from those who would steal it. We've been reflecting in our weekend conference, the serpent comes to the woman in the garden and he says, did God really say? Are you sure? Are you? Did He really say that? Did God really say that? And here's the tricky thing about that. If there's been a passage of time between God speaking and the moment when the snake comes along, let me think. Did God really say? And one of the reasons we have to preserve and protect and treasure the Word of God is because we have an enemy, a spiritual enemy who wants to steal the Word of God. But can I say, like there are some people, whether they are agents of the enemy or they're just people, they try to steal the Word of God too. I remember being in the boy's model and sixth former and going to my RE teacher to tell him that God had spoken to me and called me to ministry and I was leaving school and going to Bible college. My RE teacher was a Baptist believer. He went to a Baptist church. Great man. Lovely man. Great RE teacher. Fantastic guy. And I had a quick thing with him, a bit of a rapport. And I went to him excited and I said to him, I won't say his name, I said, I believe God's called me to ministry and I'm going to leave school. I was doing my A-levels and I'm going to get a job in the civil service and then I'm going to Bible college next year. And he said to me, God has not spoken to you. Straight in my face. Like he didn't, it wasn't a discussion. He went, God has not spoken. Don't be stupid. He said to me, he said, here's what you need to do. Finish your A-levels, go to uni, live a bit and then go to Bible college. He said, because God hasn't spoken to you. And I said to him, Mr. So and so, with all due respect, you're wrong. He has spoken to me. That was an RE teacher. I then went to my principal, Mr. Davis. Mr. Davis, I can say it now because he's gone, he's passed away. Mr. Davis, no stretch of the imagination was a follower of Jesus. And I walked in to see Mr. Davis in his office, never forget it to the day I die. And I said to Mr. Davis, Mr. Davis, I've come to tell you I'm leaving school. I'm not making this up as a sermon. This really happened, right? This really happened. Mr. Davis stood up from behind his desk and he says, I know why you're leaving school. And I said, well, why do you think I'm leaving school, Mr. Davis? He said, you have the call of God in your life. And I went, really? And here's what he said. This blew my brains out. So I've just had my head kicked in by my Jesus following RE teacher and a non-Christian sort of like man. Here's what he said to me. He said, when I saw you walk into the courtyard as a first year, I saw the hand of God on you. And then it's suddenly all the dots connected. I then realized why Mr. Davis had taken such a personal interest in me in school. I couldn't work it out because I wasn't really a very clever boy. And I'm like, why is this man keep like stalking me and like encouraging me and helping me? What's going on here? Many years later, I wrote to Mr. Davis and told him what my life looked like. And he wrote me a beautiful letter in return. You see, there'd be people who try to steal the word. Don't be stupid. Why would God speak to you? God said what to CFC? Were you boys eating too much pizza that night when God said that? Come on, are you with me? But we also, we almost also must keep the word of God from slander. When Joseph tells his dreams to his brother and his father, look at these words. It says this, his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in his mind. For those of you that love hunting rabbits on this cool little thing, in the Greek translation of the Old Testament Bible, when it says Jacob kept this matter, it is an identical phrase and an identical parsing to the phrase that Mary uses in chapter two, verse 51, when it says she treasured these things in her heart by Jesus, identical. And Jacob didn't understand it all, but he treasured it, protected it from slander. If the band, you want to come and join me as I sort of bring this to a, that encourages you that I'm about to finish, all right? Stay with me for a couple more minutes and I am done. I think I've got about five minutes and then I'm finished, all right? Everybody okay? All right then. Not just value the words and protect the words, but lastly, preserve the words. Mary of course, so when Dr. Luke writes Mary's story, now please forgive me for this, I don't want this to sound pretentious, but when Dr. Luke write Mary's story, he writes it in his language, he writes it in Greek. But of course, when Mary thinks Bibles, she'll think Hebrew, okay? Next, I've been reading through the book of Deuteronomy as part of my daily devotions and I've noticed something that I've never noticed before as I've just slowed down and read it carefully and slowly. There's a beautiful word in Deuteronomy and it's the Hebrew word shamar, beautiful word. And shamar means to watch over, preserve, protect, and keep, are you with me? Deuteronomy is important because Deuteronomy is the book of words, it's the last words of Moses before the people go into the wilderness and there's no coincidence that in a book called words, the word shamar, guard, keep, watch over, and protect, is used 68 times in the book of Deuteronomy. It's everywhere, it's amazing, it's gorgeous, great word study. If you put all the five books of Moses together, Deuteronomy rocks shamar. It like outstrips all the references in comparison. It's massive. And there's no coincidence there because if you think about the words of God, here's what Moses is saying, watch over the words of God, protect the words of God, keep the words of God, guard the words of God, make sure you protect them. In fact, here's an example of it in Deuteronomy 8.11, be careful that you do not forget the Lord your God, failing to observe His commands, His laws, and His degrees that I'm giving to you. Be careful, watch over, observe, watch over, twice it's used in the one verse. And here's what Moses is saying, these words aren't just words, these are the words of God. And if you're gonna go into the land and possess this amazing land that your God has given you, then you need to watch over, preserve, and protect His words. In fact, remember the Jacob reference about keeping these things in his heart? In the Hebrew Bible, the word is shamar. He's watching over, preserving, and protecting these words. And for those who did our conference last little Eden echo for you, when God puts the man in the garden, He says to the man, serve it and keep it. Serve it and keep it. And the word keep it is watch over it, guard it, nurture it, understand this garden is not just any garden, it's God's garden. God planted this garden, watch over it, and keep it, and protect it. Why should we watch over and keep and protect the word of God? Last idea for you, because here's what God says about His words. Here's what God says to Mary. Here's what God's saying to the people of Israel. Here's what God's saying to CFC. Here's what God's saying to you as an individual. He says this, my word that comes out of my mouth, He says, it will not return to me empty, but it will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it. Why are we watching over the word? Because it won't return empty. Why are we watching over the word? Because it will achieve what God desires. Why are we watching over the word? Because eventually, sooner or later, or maybe later than sooner, God's going to do what He said. And when He speaks at a moment in time to a Mary, when He speaks at a moment in time to a Moses, when He speaks at a moment in time to me and you, to the leadership of CFC, to people in this room and people online, when He speaks in that moment of time, even if we don't fully understand the word, we know this, He has spoken. And our responsibility is not to work it out. Our responsibility is not to do all the detail. Our responsibility when God speaks is grab it, treasure it, protect it, preserve it. Why? Because eventually, the word that came out of His mouth will achieve what it was sent to achieve. Come on. And that's for me, that's for you, that's for CFC, and that is for us all. And I don't know where you are as a follower of Jesus. You may be here as a guest and not a follower of Jesus, and maybe you will encounter Him for the first time in your life. Those online, I don't know where you are in terms of your journey. But here's what I do know, if God has spoken, those words are valuable. And if God has spoken, my responsibility is to treasure them, even if I don't fully understand them. And how do I treasure them? I protect them from those who would steal it. I protect them from those who would slander it. And I watch over it. I nurture it. I take care of it like Adam was asked to take care of the garden and Moses asked the people of God to take care of the Torah. If you watch over His word, sooner or later, He will do what He said. So ladies and gentlemen like Mary, let us preserve and protect all His words continuously. My question to you today, what has He said? My question to the leadership of CFC, what has He said? My question to you as an individual, to a man, to a woman on a journey of faith with Jesus, what has He said? And Mary speaks to us from two centuries ago and she said, listen, even if you don't fully understand it and get it, treasure it. Lean into it, grab it, keep it, and eventually, eventually His word will achieve what it was designed to achieve. Will you stand with me if you can? The band are going to lead us in a song. I'm going to pray. I know I'm speaking to a community that loves the Bible. And so you think, John, we've got all this stuff, but I love the Bible too, and yet can I say to you, there have been moments when I've forgotten the word of God. There are moments I have, this is not my devotional Bible, this is sort of my preaching Bible. If you looked at my devotional Bible, it has dates on it, marks on it, moments where God spoke to me. Do you know, there have been moments even in this last year, this last 12 months, and I've opened up the Bible and there's a date in my margin, I went, oh my goodness, I remember what He said. And then I'm challenged by the fact, why didn't I remember that? And our job is not to work it out. Sometimes we can, sometimes we can't. Sometimes it's clear, sometimes a bit foggy. Our job when God speaks is treasure it, hold it, keep it. So that whenever His word comes to pass, we will be there, not just at the beginning when He spoke, but at the end when He fulfills. Lord, we thank you for your word. Your word that is a lamp to our feet and a light to our path. The unfolding of your words gives light and gives understanding to the simple. We declare today, Lord, that if your law had not been our delight, we would have perished in our affliction. We declare that every word of God is flawless and that you are a shield to all who take refuge in you. We declare that your word is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, training in righteousness so that we will be thoroughly equipped for every good work. Your law is perfect, reviving our souls. And Lord, I pray that the words of our mouth and the meditation of our heart will be pleasing to you as we treasure what you have said. Thank you for Mary. It wasn't just the mother of Jesus. That was brilliant enough, but became a follower of Jesus. Lord, may we not just be there at the beginning when you speak, but there at the end when you fulfill. Help my brothers and sisters, help this church, help each of us to treasure. Watch over, guard, protect, and keep your word so that it would not only live in us, but ultimately and gloriously live through us. In Jesus' name, Amen. Amen. Amen.
