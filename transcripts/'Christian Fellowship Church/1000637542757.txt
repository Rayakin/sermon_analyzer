Welcome to the CFC podcast. Before we get stuck in, I'd like to take a minute to let you know about our Compassion Appeal. Every year, CFC's Compassion Appeal impacts thousands of lives across Northern Ireland. People struggling with basic needs like putting food on the table, keeping warm and getting school uniforms for their children. The book of James that we've been studying is very clear about our responsibility to outwork our faith in our actions, and the Compassion Appeal is a great way to do that. If you'd like to join us in making a real difference in the lives of those who need it most, head to thisiscfc.com, that's thisiscfc.com, where you can give to this year's appeal and see what a difference your generosity makes. Thank you. Morning. Oh, you can't fall asleep now, okay, so morning, morning. So good to be here this morning. I remember way probably back whenever we first started CFC, my kids were, I think Noah was probably P6, so around 10 years old, and Megan was a bit younger, and we were standing at the traffic lights just outside where you cross over to Tesco, and I remember standing with them and saying, you know, wait for the green man, wait for the green man, and the two of them are wiggling about, and you know, they're mucking around, and you're just like, wait for the green man, wait for the green man. And you're standing there waiting, and we were standing, and the green man didn't come up yet, but all the traffic had stopped, and this gentleman who was standing beside me decided to cross the road when the red man was still up. As he went to step out, I was like, wait, wait, and he jumped back like this, he's like, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, and my kids kind of looked at me, and I kind of looked at him, and I was like, I'm sorry, I'm just trying to teach my kids not to move until the green man comes. And it just reminded me this morning about how we spend so much of our time waiting, standing in place and waiting. The average person throughout their lifetime spends approximately five years waiting in lines and queues. That's a lot of time, isn't it? And out of those five years, six months are at traffic lights, I mean, although I think around Belfast at the minute it's much more than that, but yeah, are waiting, and I think that there's two different types of people that you find in these queues, either you're probably like me, and you're standing quite impatiently, but you're also standing with your head down, and you're like, don't talk to me, I'm on a mission, and I don't want to have a conversation, or you're like probably one of the Mitchell men, and I can see my brother-in-law calling over there, who will talk to everybody in the queue, and by the time he gets to the top of the queue, will know everything about them, and makes the most of that opportunity. But the reality is that aside from lines and queues, we spend so much of our time waiting, and I look back over this year that has just gone past, I can identify many times of waiting. Waiting for a day off, in the busyness of work and ministry and family, waiting for a day that one of the plates that I'm spinning might come crashing down, waiting for food, that's one of my favourite things to do, by the way, but also waiting for pain to move on, or for breakthrough to come, or for a prayer to be answered, or for salvation to be realised in loved one's lives. And sometimes in the waiting, I'm not really sure what it is that I'm waiting for. Sometimes God has called me aside, and he's pulled me apart, and he's drawn me into himself, and he's asked me to wait, and I don't know what I'm waiting for. But the one thing that I do know is that he's always there, and that in the waiting, I gain a revelation of him that is so different to what I had before. Because God does something in a waiting space, where he takes the knowledge that we have, our head knowledge, and he moves it into something that becomes a personal intimacy with him. All of the things that we think we know about him, all of the things that we've read about him, all the things that people have told us about him, all the things that we firmly believe in, become reality when we draw into a space of waiting with God. And on reflection, that's what the Christmas season is all about. It's a season of waiting, followed by the opportunity to really know God, the God who stepped down into our present day, put on flesh, and walked among us. Advent is a season of waiting. And for centuries, the Jewish people had been waiting for their Messiah. They had been waiting for the one to come who would overthrow their oppressors, who would bring victory and freedom. And they were waiting for this fulfillment of a promise that had been written about in scripture for centuries. They were waiting in hope. And I don't think it's really any different for us today. Yes, we also are waiting for Jesus to come back, for him to come back. And this time, not for him to step into the middle of our mess and do life with us, but to lift us out of that mess and take us into an eternity that has so much promises fulfilled and so much hope to gain. And I think when we think of this word waiting, we think of it as a static or a stagnant space. When I think of my kids and telling them to wait at the side of the road, I just wanted them to stand still, not to move. But the reality is that there's tension in that moment because they want to move. They want to move forward. They're waiting for the signal to go, and yet there's something holding them back. And so actually waiting spaces are not spaces of stagnant and static, but instead spaces where there is moving happening, even though we don't see it. And this morning, we're going to look at one of the characters in the Christmas story, Mary. We're going to think about how in her space, where she was waiting from that moment when the angel gave her the news that she was the chosen one who was going to give birth to the Messiah, the one that all of Israel had been waiting for. Until that, so her waiting space of that news that came to her right to the moment where she held the saviour of the world into her arms and gazed into his face in this moment of intimacy, what happened in that space? And I want us to think about the movement in there, because there's always movement in waiting. There's always movement in waiting. We're always being affected. We're always being stretched. We're always growing. And why is that? And it's because of the tension. It's because of the tension in that space. Now, I am no fitness instructor, and I'm not going to pretend that I am down in the gym working out all the time. But what I do know about exercise is this, that muscles grow when you put tension on them. But one of the three key things that is required for growth is tension. And so when we step into these spaces of waiting, in order for us to grow, tension is necessary. And so this morning, we have a choice in the spaces that we find ourselves in as we wait. We have the choice to embrace the tension, even though it's difficult, even though it stretches us sometimes to what we think is beyond our capacity, even though it's painful, even though sometimes things get a little bit broken in the midst of it all, and allow growth and flourishment and movement to come, or we step into a space of waiting and become static and stagnant and invite death and destruction into our circumstances. And so this morning, we're going to read Mary's story. We're going to read both her song and also before that, the Annunciation, When the Angel Came. We're going to start in Luke chapter one. So if you've got your Bibles there in front of you on your phone, I'm going to read right through it. It's a bit of a longer passage, but I think it's really important for us to hear this because these are these are so familiar passages that you probably skip over them. I know this story. It's really familiar. But listen to the words, listen to Mary, listen to what's happening in the midst of it all. And then we'll take some time to unpack it. Luke chapter one, verse twenty six, in the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee, to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin's name was Mary. The angel went to her and said, Greetings, you who are highly favoured. The Lord is with you. Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be. But the angel said to her, Do not be afraid, Mary, you have found favour with God. You will conceive and give birth to a son and you are to call him Jesus. He will be great and will be called the son of the most high. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father, David, and he will reign over Jacob's descendants forever. His kingdom will never end. How will this be, Mary asked the angel, since I am a virgin? The angel answered, The Holy Spirit will come on you and the power of the most high will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called the son of God. Even Elizabeth, your relative, is going to have a child in her old age. And she who is said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month. For no word from God will ever fail. I am the Lord's servant, Mary answered. May your word to me be fulfilled. Then the angel left her. At that time, Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea, where she entered Zacharias home and greeted Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. In a loud voice, she exclaimed, Blessed are you among women and blessed is the child you will bear. But why am I so favored that the mother of my Lord should come to me? As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill his promises to her. And Mary said, My soul glorifies the Lord and my soul rejoices in God, my savior. For he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant. From now on, all generations will call me blessed for the mighty one has done great things for me. Holy is his name. His mercy extends to those who fear him from generation to generation. He has performed mighty deeds with his arm. He has scattered those who are pride in their inmost thoughts. He has brought down rulers from their thrones and he has lifted up the humble. He is filled with hungry, the hungry with good things and has sent the rich away. He has helped his servant Israel remember to be merciful to Abraham and to his descendants forever, just as he promised our ancestors. Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home. It's a really familiar story. And I think that we do have this danger of just skipping over it and even ignoring some of the bits that you just think I don't even know what that means. I probably read Mary's song a million times and always just thought, well, that's nice. I have no idea what she's singing about. But actually, if we just take a moment this morning, and I've just got four things that I want to pull out of this, four spaces where we see movement in Mary's story, and I want us to think about the hope that that gives us as we wait in waiting spaces today. The first thing is this, that Mary moves from misunderstanding to trusting, from misunderstanding to trusting. The first thing that the angel says to her is, you who are highly favoured, that's what he calls her. And in that moment, it tells us Mary is troubled. Now, if you didn't read on, it says Mary is troubled by his words. I would totally understand that she was troubled. This man, like an angel, had disappeared in front of her. He is glowing and he is speaking words to her. I wouldn't really be listening to what he was saying. I'd be more concerned that there's this strange thing happening. I'd be wondering what I had to eat for breakfast, like what's going on? But yet in the midst of this completely extraordinary moment, the word that the angel speaks to her is what troubles Mary. And it's because the words that she hears doesn't match up to the circumstances that she finds herself in. Because what she hears is God speaking through this angel to her and saying that she is highly favoured and God is with her. But yet her reality is, I am some mid-teen wee girl who lives in the middle of nowhere just getting on with my life. I just go day to day. I show up in the spaces that I'm supposed to show up. I'm trying to organise a wedding to a man who I don't even know. I'm trying to navigate family stuff. I'm trying to prepare meals. I'm trying to get water from the well. This is my everyday ordinary circumstances. And none of that tells me that I am highly favoured, that I, that God is with me. And yet in the midst of all of this, as she tries to process it, the angel continues and he starts telling her that she is going to be the one who will carry the saviour, the messiah who is so long awaited. And the language that the angel uses, this messianic language, will be so familiar with her as she has read and learned the scriptures and memorised them over years. And when she hears words like, I am going to give, you're going to give birth to a son and you're to call him Jesus and he will be great and he will be called the son of the most high. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David and he will reign over Jacob's descendants forever. All of this language is telling her that the angel is talking about the one who has been promised for so long. And yet here is her in the midst of her circumstances going, I just don't understand. It doesn't make sense. And yet in the midst of it all, her response is this in verse 38, may your word be fulfilled. I love the way the ESV puts it. It says, let it be unto me according to your word. And so what Mary does in the midst of her misunderstanding is she moves to this place of trusting where she says that even though my circumstances say something else, I'm going to listen and trust your word, God, because that is all I have in this moment. Reminds me of Psalm 25 verses one to three, where it says in you, Lord, my God, I put my trust. I trust in you do not let me be put to shame nor let my enemies triumph over me. No one who hopes in you will ever be put to shame. And I don't know what your waiting space is like this morning. I don't know what you're walking through. I don't know what you're carrying or how long you've been waiting or what you're waiting for. But what I do know is that the word of God is true and that when he tells us that you can trust him, you can trust him because he is the most trustworthy person that you will ever know. And when he tells us that when you put your trust in him, you will not be put to shame. You will not be put to shame. And so regardless of what your circumstances look like, how transient they are and how moving they are and how uncertain they are, we have the opportunity to place our trust in the one who never changes, who never moves and who's so trustworthy. And I know that just sounds, well, that's easy to say, but I think our prayer needs to be like the man who Jesus met. Do you remember the man who had the son, who had the mute spirit and Jesus talked to him about believing and trusting and his response to Jesus was, I believe, help me in my unbelief. And maybe that's what your prayer needs to be this morning. I believe God. I believe in you and I trust in you, but yet help me in my unbelief. In the midst of the difficulties that I'm walking through, in the midst of the waiting space that I occupy, I still choose to trust you and I need you to help me in the midst of that. And that's where we see the second movement, this movement in Mary's story of moving from powerless to power filled. How do we trust in God in the midst of our unbelief? We do that through the enabling of the Holy Spirit and Mary who questions how all of this will happen. How will this happen? I'm a virgin. How will this happen? And the angel replies, and he says this to her in verse 35, he says, the Holy Spirit will come on you and the power of the most high will overshadow you. It's incredible that God moves in two ways here. Not only does the Holy Spirit fill her, but the power of the most high overshadows her. That's what the Holy Spirit does. The Holy Spirit fills us and he enables us. As Christians, when we place our trust in Jesus, the promise that Jesus made to us, that we would be filled with the Holy Spirit, that we would have another who would walk with us as we walk into everything that we've been called to. Jesus told us that when he left, another would come and he would enable us to do greater things even than what Jesus has done. That's who the Holy Spirit is. And just as the Holy Spirit filled Mary in that moment and enabled her to step into the fullness of her calling, that's exactly what the Holy Spirit does for each one of us. But he doesn't just do it so that a job can get done. You know, God doesn't look at us and go, right, what needs done today? That needs done. I'm going to pick her and she'll fit into that and I'm just going to fill her with some power and that'll get the job done, tick, and I'll move on to the next thing. No, actually what happens is that God loves us so much that he wants to see us fulfilled in every possible way, in the fullness of everything that he has called us and created us for. And he does that by enabling us through his Holy Spirit. And because he enables us through his Holy Spirit, he also surrounds us with his power and authority. He doesn't send us out on our own, but he loves us. He embraces us. He surrounds us and he covers us. I love the way Tom Wright in his book, Look for Everyone, explains this. He says this, Mary is, to that extent, the supreme example of what happens when God is at work through human beings. God's power from outside and the indwelling spirit within together result in things being done which would have been unthinkable any other way. That's incredible, isn't it? God's power on the outside, the indwelling spirit within, resulting in things being done that would be unthinkable. What's unthinkable in your space? What's unthinkable in the place that you occupy right now? What's unthinkable and beyond your wildest dreams? And maybe it's unthinkable because you don't even dare to think it, because you don't want to hope. You don't want to hope for something and be disappointed. But God's promise to us is that in our waiting spaces, that he meets us with his presence and with his power, and he does the unthinkable, that his word never fails. And so I challenge you this morning to think the unthinkable, to not only put your trust in God, but to expect great things from him, because he is the God who never fails. He is the God who changes things into not what they look like, but what he can make them to be. The third thing that we see in Mary's story, the third movement that we see, is that she moves from being shamed to blessed, shamed to blessed. And if we really consider Mary's circumstances, it's not good. It's not good. It's this young girl, mid-teen girl, who already has the most lowest standing in society. I mean, she's insignificant really. And now she is a young mid-teen who is pregnant and not married. And the shame that is on her is incredible. The shame not just on her, but on her family, on her husband to be, on her community. And on top of that, there's this doubt about the authenticity of her story. I mean, people are just like, she's deluded. An angel appeared to you and told you that you were going to be pregnant and the son that you would have would be the Messiah that we've been waiting for. I mean, we hear that and we think, yes, because we know the story. But the reality is, that's just pure, absolute fairy tale. If this was everyday Belfast and somebody came and told us that, we'd probably take them off and help them to get the help that they needed. I mean, this girl was saying yes in the midst of knowing that the shame and the pain that would follow her was going to be so significant. And the reality is that people looked at her and thought that she was mad, thought that she was a liar, thought that she was deluded, thought that she was an adulterer. And yet she still said yes. And she continues to say yes, even though she knows that it will take her further into shame and further into pain and further into isolation. And what she doesn't know is that it'll take her into more pain than she can ever imagine when she has to watch her son hanging on a cross and dying in front of her very eyes. And I'm sure she's feeling it all. Anger, disappointment, hopelessness. I mean, that's how I would feel in the midst of all of that. You'd think that her story would travel in one direction, but she sings this beautiful song that declares something completely different. And we read it in verse 46, that Mary's response in the midst of all of this is this, is this, my soul glorifies the Lord. My spirit rejoices in God, my savior, for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant. And from now on, all generations will call me blessed for the mighty one has done great things for me. Holy is his name. A song of praise and adoration, hope-filled, joy-filled, lifted high, recognizing her identity in her savior, the blessed one. And what a transformation, because not only had she, she couldn't understand it when the angel had said to her, you are blessed and highly favored. She didn't get it. And then she went to see Elizabeth and Elizabeth said, you are blessed. And now she's got to this point in this song where she is going, yes, I am blessed. I can see my identity and my savior in the midst of all of the chaos. And what her response in the midst of all of this is hope for all of us who don't see what God is doing in the midst of our waiting spaces. Mary teaches us an appropriate response. Even in that moment, she didn't know how she was blessed. Nothing had changed. She probably hadn't even had her first period. She probably hadn't even got a bump at that point. You know, she was trusting in God completely. And yet God did a work in her that helped her to see her true identity. And her response to him was praise and adoration. She declares her identity, even though it wasn't what was seen. She called herself blessed, even though to society, she was full of shame. And I wonder what it is that you need to praise God for in your identity today. I love those verses in Psalm 139, where it says, I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made. And maybe you need to praise God today and declare yourself what it is that you're expecting from him. I praise you, God, because I am healed. I praise you, God, because I am healed. I praise you, God, because I am prosperous. I praise you, God, because I have the thing that I am looking for. And sometimes we need to speak out in faith that which God has spoken and done in our life. And finally, the fourth thing that we see in Mary's story, the fourth movement that we see is that she moves from limited by her present circumstances to finding excitement and freedom in eternity. She moves from being limited by the present to excited by eternity. And how easy it is for us to let our present circumstances dictate our future path. The choices that we make in the midst of despair, in the midst of difficulty can have rippling effects for eternity. We've all been there, so overwhelmed by the immediacy of our current reality, the words spoken over us, the diagnosis given to us, the bank balance on our screens, the unreturned calls, the constant rejection, the unanswered prayers. And hopelessness seems like an obvious state to embrace. But yet Mary teaches us something completely new because what she realizes is that her story is a small part of a bigger story. That what happens in her space is limited to that moment, but yet it will have a ripple effect for all of eternity. That even in that moment when she carries the Messiah, the saviour of the world, and his arrival onto earth and those few years that he spends on earth will have an impact on eternity that will change things forever and a day. Instead of being stuck in her current narrative, and we know that it's not good, that she carries pain and shame for so long, but yet the bigger story says something different because her part of saying yes in the middle of her waiting space brings freedom for so many because she says yes to God. And what we see in her story is this beautiful change. Then the second half of her song, we see this point where she starts, instead of praising God for the circumstances that she finds herself in and her identity in it, but she changes it to this forward thinking, praise and worship. And it's like a prophetic declaration of everything that the kingdom of God is going to be, about how the saviour that she is carrying inside of her will be the one who will bring about a revolution and will change things, that everything that is seen will become and turned on its head, that everything will change because of the one that she carries. And it feels a little bit like, I'm going to show my age here. You know, do you remember whenever you used to watch the boy bands, they used to perform, I'm trying to think of like Westlife, okay, all in the stools and they sang their song. It was just really nice. And you're like, yeah, I get it. It's really good. And then the key changes and they step up and everyone just feels it, don't they? Everyone's like, yes, I'm in. I don't even know what you're singing about, but I believe you because I am so in this moment with you. And that's what happens in Mary's song, because what she does is she brings us to this place was where she's ushering in the kingdom already, even though she's holding the saviour of the world in her womb. And actually this powerful declaration, not only points us to this kingdom that will bring in change, but it points us to the saviour who will bring that in. She confidently proclaims in the midst of a broken story, what has been promised, what will be and what is currently unfolding in the middle of what seems like a mess. She speaks language of hope. And that's what we take from her story. Hope. We take this hope that it's not just about the moment that we find ourselves in, but there is this beautiful big picture story that tells us of a God who loved us so much that he sacrificed everything so that he could draw near to us and become close to us. And the beauty of it is for each one of us is that we're on the other side of this story, that we know who Jesus is. We know that he is a saviour that can be trusted in. We know that he has already come, that he has defeated sin and death once and for all, and that he has won the ultimate victory for each and every one of us. That for in his death and resurrection, he purchased his life to the full and we can experience that not just in eternity, but right here where we are living and in the spaces we occupy, that we can be free, that we can experience the fullness of his love and grace, empowered by his Holy Spirit. Mary's song points us towards a saviour, the saviour who, if you flick over a few chapters in Luke 4, unravels the scroll of Isaiah and makes this declaration of who he is. The spirit of the sovereign Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. And he stops at Isaiah, in our Bibles it's Isaiah chapter 61, and he reads out the first two verses and he stops. But if you read on in verse 3, this is what it says. To comfort all who mourn and provide for those who grieve in Zion, to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair, they will be called oaks of righteousness. The saviour who fulfilled the prophetic words spoken by Isaiah does exactly that for his mother as he is in her womb. In that space of chaos and grief and disappointment and mourning and despair, Mary finds salvation because of who she has said yes to. And he turns her mourning into dancing. He gives her a crown of beauty. He gives her the oil of joy and he gives her a garment of praise. And yes, she is an oak of righteousness. And that's what he can do for you. That's who Jesus is. That's who our saviour is. That even in the waiting spaces, he joins us. He inhabits them with us. He empowers us through them. And what he does in you will be so much more significant than you would ever hope or imagine. And all he's calling you to do today is to trust in him. To say to him, I trust in you and I believe that I will not be put to shame. And so as we invite the band to come up, we're just going to take a moment to respond. And I really feel that our response needs to be movement today. I feel like that we're talking about movement. We're moving from something to something else. And as I pray, I'm going to ask you to move if you would like to see the movement of God And that movement might just be you standing up where you are in this moment. It might be you kneeling. It might be you moving out to the side. But I'm going to challenge you just to do something different in this space. That as you wait on God to do everything that you hope and imagine that he can do for you, as you expect great things from him, that your movement physically will signify a movement in the spiritual. And so we're just going to bow our heads and pray together. And just before I pray, if you want to move in your space right now, I invite you to do that as I pray over you. Father God, I thank you that you are the God who is the most trustworthy one. I thank you, Father God, that you are the one that we can put our trust in because you are so good. I thank you that you promised to us that you will never leave us or forsake us. I thank you that your promise to us that you will never leave us or forsake us rings true today. And Lord, that as we move in some way today, Lord, we're saying yes to you. We're saying yes, even though I don't get it. Even though I can't see it. Even though I don't understand it. Lord, I trust in you. I believe that you will make a movement in this space. And I'm sorry, Lord. I'm sorry for all the times that I've doubted you. I'm sorry for all the times when I haven't spoken out the things that I know that need to be said. And so this morning, I come with an open hands and open heart and surrender it all to you. Surrender all to you. I believe, Lord, help me in my unbelief. And just while we continue in prayer, maybe you're here this morning and you have never accepted Jesus as your Lord and Savior. Maybe you've never said that yes to him for the first time. And you can do that this morning. You can say yes to Jesus. What better time to say yes to Jesus at this time of Christmas when we celebrate him coming into the world. And if you'd like to do that, I'm going to lead you in a very short prayer. And you can pray that with me. Thank you, God, for sending your son, Jesus, into this world. Thank you that he lived and walked among us, that he died for all of the things that I've done wrong. And thank you that he has risen again. I'm sorry for everything that I have done that has separated me from you. But today I say yes. I say yes to you. I say yes to you. I say yes to you. I say yes to you. Come into my heart, Lord Jesus. Come in today. Come in today and fill me with your Holy Spirit. In Jesus name. Amen.
