Welcome to the CFC podcast. Before we get stuck in, I'd like to take a minute to let you know about our Compassion Appeal. Every year, CFC's Compassion Appeal impacts thousands of lives across Northern Ireland. People struggling with basic needs like putting food on the table, keeping warm and getting school uniforms for their children. The book of James that we've been studying is very clear about our responsibility to outwork our faith in our actions, and the Compassion Appeal is a great way to do that. If you'd like to join us in making a real difference in the lives of those who need it most, head to thisiscfc.com. That's thisiscfc.com, where you can give to this year's appeal and see what a difference your generosity makes. Thank you. All right, guys, Christmas is coming, I'm very excited. Next, my decorations are up and I don't care if you think that that's a bad idea. They have been up for two weeks, yes, they have, and Advent, we start our Advent series next week. Cannot wait, it's going to be cracking, so super excited for that. Just as a side note, you know, Christmas is not just like the 25th, it's a season in the church calendar, you know, where we prepare for the coming of Christ, that's what Advent is, and I would really strongly recommend that you think about personally how you're going to prepare for the coming of Christ, you know, as we celebrate his birth when we get to the 25th. How are you preparing your hearts to receive him again in this season? So Christmas, all excited. Anyway, need to get back to today, not live in the future, because we're in the final part of our values series. So at CFC, we have 10 core values that have been values at CFC for a very, very long time. And every so often, we come back and we teach on just a few of those to make sure that we're centered back around who we are as people. And today we're going to look at the value of praise and worship. Now, I know those of you who've been in church a long time know that worship is more than just singing. I get that. However, I want to propose to you today that singing is a really, really important part of your praise and your worship. And I don't know if you've noticed, it's a bit weird. Do you not think it's a bit weird that a bunch of people gather every week and stand up and face a wall and sing songs? It's almost like anybody else is slightly strange, do you know? And yet we insist on doing it. The church has done it for centuries. They have gathered together and when they have gathered, they have sung. I think, like Heather's right, we need to ask more why questions. Like if we're going to insist on coming together every Sunday and singing songs, some of which you will love and some of which you will hate, why do we keep doing this? Why is it so important? And so we're going to look at that today, I think it's really, really important that we do. And we're going to do that via a whistle-stop tour through the Gospel of John. I'm going to do my best to say in one book of the Bible today. You know Genesis is going to be in there. But we're going to do a whistle-stop, why do I always try to say a whistle-stop tour? It's so hard to say. Whistle-stop tour through the Gospel of John. I don't know if you know much about the Gospels. We have Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. John dances to his own tune. Matthew, Mark, and Luke, they work together. And John is just different. John is actually my favorite Gospel. And John has this thing that theologians like to call high Christology. And what it really means is that John is really, really interested in making sure that you and I, the readers of his writings, know that Jesus is God, you know. Yes, he's fully man, and some of the other Gospel writers will focus a lot on don't miss the fact that he became flesh, because that's really important. But John's emphasis is in the middle of the humility and the humanness of Jesus when he comes, oh, please don't miss that this is still God. That he is God in flesh, so he has high Christology. And the whole point of the Gospel of John is to make sure that you don't miss him. You see, the thing about Jesus is this. When he appears, he appears in such a humble manner that it's extremely easy to miss the fact that God is with you. It's extremely easy to miss. Not just in the Gospels, but in your everyday life. It is extremely easy to miss the fact that Jesus shows up in the most unexpected ways, and you and I, God can be right beside us, and we miss that he's there. And John is very intentional in showing us how easy it is for Jesus to be right here and us to miss him. And he wants to make sure that you and I don't miss him. So John opens with this epic introduction, and he says, in the beginning was the word, John 1, 1, and the word was with God, and the word was God. This is his introduction to Jesus. He was with God in the beginning, and through him all things were made, and without him nothing was made that has been made. In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind, and that light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. What an introduction. Like, it's a good introduction. And then he goes on to say this in verse 14, that word, that same word that was existing in the beginning, through him all things were made, that same word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. Unbelievable. Unbelievable things. What's really interesting is just a few verses later, right, so that's verse 14, that's dealing with the incarnation of Jesus, Jesus coming into a female womb, encapsulating all of the godness of him into a tiny fetus inside a female womb, okay? The word became flesh and dwelt among us. And then in verse 29, we read this. The next day, John, that's not John the gospel writer, that's John the Baptist, saw Jesus as same Jesus, who's now an adult, coming towards him, and he said, look, the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. Here's the thing. Between verse 14, when the word becomes flesh, and verse 29, when John the Baptist points to him and says, here comes the lamb of God who's going to take away the sin of the world. There is three decades of life when God is walking around in the world and nobody notices. Three decades and nobody notices. God goes to the marketplace and buys things off people, and they literally touch the hand of God when they receive his money, and they don't know. God works on projects in his dad's business, and the recipient of those projects are receiving the goodness of God, and they don't know. God is raised amongst brothers and sisters, and they don't know. And even Mary, who knows that he is God because she was there at the immaculate conception, seems to forget sometimes that she's dealing with God. Watch her boss him around, although you and I probably try to boss God around sometimes, too. It's like even Mary seems to forget that this is God, because, you see, Jesus shows up in such a humble manner that it's really easy to miss the fact that this is all the fullness of God dwelling in bodily form among us. He is here. Oh, please don't miss him. And the reality is, in that moment, when John the Baptist looks at him and says, this is the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world, do you know what? He's been queuing. Jesus has been queuing with everybody else to get baptized, literally brushing shoulders with people. God. And they don't know, because they're all looking at John the Baptist. You see, everybody's eyes have been on John the Baptist since the moment John the Baptist was born. Jesus has a miraculous birth, yes, but it's a very private miraculous birth, and it's a miraculous birth that can be explained away by the cynic. Oh, Mary, just, that was another man's child. It can be explained away by the cynic. John the Baptist's birth cannot be explained. Nobody can explain it. Even the cynic can't get their head around it. Because Elizabeth and Zachariah, John the Baptist's parents, are too old to have children and everybody knows it. And so this is what it says about John the Baptist in Luke 1, 65, all the neighbors were filled with awe. That's when he's born. And throughout the whole country of Judea, people were talking about all these things. And everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, what then is this child going to be? For the Lord's hand was on him. Everybody's been watching John the Baptist from the moment he was born, because they know something's miraculous about him. But in their eyes being fixed on John the Baptist, they have missed the fact that God himself is standing beside them in the crowd, waiting to be baptized. Always here, please don't miss him. So John the Baptist points him out, always here, please don't miss him. And John's gospel continues in this vein, that God is here, but we have missed him. And so we get into John, the theme of water is really important in John's gospel, and we'll see a bit of that as we move through today. We get into John 2, and Jesus is at a wedding, and his mom's bossing him around. See, she forgets sometimes that it's God, not just her kid. And she's bossing him around, saying, the wine's run out and you need to do something about it. And Jesus does this miracle, and I love it. Have you ever been in a room, right, where something's happening and then somebody gives you a wee cheeky wink? Because something else is also happening, and they're just going away, oh, there's a wee understory here, wee wink, right? I feel like John, the gospel writer, gives us a wee cheeky wink. And I think that Jesus himself gives us a wee cheeky wink. Because something else is going on here when this miracle happens, and it's so, so fun. Because this is the way the miracle happens. It says in John chapter 2, on the third day a wedding took place, aren't I always saying to you, if there's an unnecessary detail, you need to ask why it's there? Why do we need to know it was on the third day? Sure, it doesn't matter. Well, yes, it does. On the third day, there was a wedding happening. Third day is going to be super important, of course, in the rest of Scripture. But I want you to remember how John started his gospel. John started his gospel by quoting Genesis 1-1. Because John and me are big mates, and we both love Genesis. He quoted what Genesis 1-1, he literally quotes it. He says, in the beginning, there are the opening words of Genesis. Because John, the gospel writer, is trying to push you to Genesis with his whole writing. So you carry the Genesis narrative with you whenever he suddenly says, on the third day, there's a wedding. Oh. Well, I wonder what happened on the third day of the Genesis account, because John obviously wants us to figure that out. So watch, work with me here. On this third day in this wedding, Jesus does a miracle. Now, Jesus is the word in the beginning. So if Jesus wants wine at this wedding, Jesus can just go, wine, and it comes. Is that what Jesus does? What does Jesus do? Does anybody know how he makes the wine? What does he use? He actually says to the servants, go fill the jars with water. Go gather the water, and then we'll go make some wine. So he gathers the water, and then he makes wine, and he does it on the third day. Genesis 1, verse 9. This is what happens on the third day. And God said, let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let the dry ground appear. Then God said, so he's gathering the waters, and then God said, let the land produce vegetation, seed-bearing plants and trees in the land that bear fruit with seed in it. There was evening, there was morning, the third day. You see, this is not Jesus' first time working with water and wine on the third day. Because on the third day in the beginning, he's working with water and fruit of the vine. He's always been up to it. And then on the third day, he gathers the waters all over again, and this time he turns them into the fruit of the vine. Because he is the word in the beginning, and it's a wee cheeky wink. And the thing about it is, it's so funny. The master of the ceremony says this, he saved the best wine to the last, that's a bit odd. He's literally drinking wine that the creator of the universe made him, and not a Scooby-Doo does he have. Not a Scooby-Doo. Jesus is right here, and he misses him. But that's not the last time we're going to see jars of water. Because then we get to John 4, and we meet a woman in a well, and she's going to buck her jars of water over the well and run off in a wee minute. But at the start, she's at a well, and God is there. And she is arguing with him. She's in an argument with him. Because God is right there, and she doesn't know. He appears so humbly, and you'd be forgiven for missing him. Because why would the living waters ask you for a drink? Because God's right there, and she's missed him. Because God never shows up the way you think he's going to, and he's always extremely humble in his coming. Oh, please don't miss him. She throws her water, she runs off. Then we get to John 5, and Jesus has an interaction this time at the side of the water. It's all about water in John. He's at the side of the water of Bethesda, and he has a conversation with a man. Now remember who we're dealing with here, the word at the beginning who spoke all things into being. And he says to this man, do you want to be well? And the man says this in John 5, 7, Sir, I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. And while I'm trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me. This man has the living water who created all things right beside him in conversation. And his eyes are fixed on these waters of Bethesda in front of him, and all his hope is on that. Because God is right there, and he's missed him. Jesus says, get up, pick up your mat, and on you go. And he does. Because remember, he's the word at the beginning. John 5. All of his glory wrapped up and concealed, and he's always there, but it seems like nobody can see him. But then in John 6, his glory slips out. Because in John 6, he's not beside the water, he's on the water. And the disciples find themselves caught in this storm, and the waves are raging. And all of a sudden comes the one who gathered the waters in the beginning, and this time he's walking on them. Because he is still the creator of all things, and all things still bow at his command. And so the waters he created bow him up as he steps out on them, and the disciples catch a glimpse of his glory. Oh, this is the fullness of God made flesh. So you can totally understand when we get to John 13, when the one who walked on waters gets down with a basin of water and kneels at Peter's feet while he recoils. Because he knows now who this is. You're going to wash my feet. You see, Peter has witnessed him turn water into wine, and he's witnessed him heal someone at the edge of the water, and he's witnessed him transform a woman's life at the well, and now he's witnessed him walk on water, and now this same Jesus is bent at a basin and washing his dirty feet in the waters that he created. And Peter recoils. He's like, no, no. And Jesus insists. Jesus insists. But here's the thing. You see, if anybody had walked into that room and you had said to them as they entered, oh, by the way, God's in here. See if you can spot which one he is. Jesus is the last one they would have picked. They would never in a million years have guessed that that was God. He's right there, and they would have missed him. And then the culmination of all things, the same God who says at the well, I am the water. If you drink from me, you'll never run dry. He's the same God who stands at the pool of Bethesda and becomes the healing waters to the man. He's the same God who walked on the waters in John 6, then hangs on a cross in John 19, and the one who is a water of life himself declares, I am thirsty. Because he so pours himself out that human beings have to give him a drink. And people gather around that cross, and you know what they think? Just another criminal. God is right there, and they've missed him. God is right here. Do not miss him. Do not miss him. And you're sitting here today, and I don't know if you've enjoyed our whistle-stop tour or not, but you're thinking, what on earth has any of this got to do with praise and worship? Ask yourself, Charlotte. Well, the praise and worship team are going to come, and as they come, stay with me, because I'm going to explain to you why this has got everything to do with praise and worship. Whenever you sing, whether that song is in key or out of key, whether it sits nicely in your range or you are squawking like a strangled parrot to reach it, whether John Wesley wrote it or some dude from Elevation that you don't know wrote it, whether the lyrics make a whole bunch of sense or not really that much sense to you at all, whether you love it or loathe it, can I tell you, none of that matters. Because whenever you raise your voice in song, you become John the Baptist, and you become John the Gospel writer, and you insist into a world where God is very present, but everyone is missing him, that he won't be missed here. You become the voice crying out in the wilderness, he's here, don't you see him? He's here, don't you see him? You become a voice of declaration. Can I tell you who you become a voice of declaration to? You become a voice of declaration to the powers of darkness. You become a voice of declaration. I don't know if you've noticed, darkness seems to think that he's got the game around here, and you become a voice saying, oh, no, no, not in our watch. Oh, yes, darkness, you think I don't see you? I see you, but I also know the light of the world who will not be overcome by darkness. Oh, darkness, you think that I can't tell that the wedding's gone dry, that we don't have enough? You think I don't know that? Oh, yes, I know there's no more wine, but I also know the one who turns water into wine. Oh, darkness, I see you, but I also see him. You think I don't see the waves of this storm? Oh, I see the waves of this storm, but don't you know I know the one who walks on the waves? Oh, I see him. Oh, darkness, don't you think I see the death and the destruction? Do you think I'm blind to it? Do you think I haven't watched the news this week? Do you think I haven't navigated difficulties and situations? Do you think for one minute that I have not seen the death and the darkness? Oh, I've seen it, but I've also seen the one that hung in the middle of it and cried, I am thirsty, so that you and I would never thirst again. I do not miss him. I will not miss him. Darkness, I see you, but I see him. It becomes a declaration of light into the darkness. You know what else it becomes a declaration to? You want to know the difference between you singing here and you singing in your car on the way here? Apart from the fact you probably had Mariah Carey in the car. There's a reason why we sing when we're together, because it's not just, your worship is not just about you and Jesus. If you think for one second you come into this place so some random paid professional can stand on a stage and point you to Jesus, you've got it all wrong. Our job is to point one another to Jesus, that's what the body of Christ does. And there's something about the gathered declaration, where you gather with brothers and sisters and you haven't a clue what they've been through this week, or what they're carrying or navigating, and they're struggling to see Jesus, and you know what you do for them? You say, he's here, don't miss him. He's here, don't miss him. And your song becomes an encouragement to the one who's gathered at those waters with everybody else to get baptized, queuing up, searching for God, and you're saying you're queuing up searching for God, God's right here, don't miss him. You sing to the woman who's at the well, who her whole relational circle has fallen apart and she doesn't know how to put any of the pieces back together, and you stand at that well with her and you say, oh don't miss him, he's here. And you go to the edge of Bethesda with the person who's been sick for 38 years and has lost all hope and is utterly disappointed and devastated and you get down on your hands and your knees with them and you begin to sing your song and you say, don't miss him, he's here. And where he is, anything is possible. Your song becomes a declaration to one another, but you know above it all, the most important thing is this, your song becomes a declaration to him that says, I see you Jesus, in the middle of the pain, in the middle of the heartache and the difficulty, in the middle of the anxiety, in the middle of the things that I cannot fix, I lift my eyes and I see you, and I want you to know Jesus that I see you, and I'm so glad you're here and I'm sorry I've missed you, I'm sorry my eyes have been down and I've been distracted by a million things, but I want you to know that right now in this place, I see you, I see you. So does your song matter? Oh, far more than you know. So I am going to invite you to stand to your feet if you're able to do so. And if you need to cough and clear that throat, go on right ahead, because we are going to sing and we are going to declare to the darkness who Jesus is, we're going to declare to one another who Jesus is, and we're going to declare to Jesus, I see you. And then you know what we're going to do? We're going to come back Wednesday night and we're going to do it all again. We're going to gather in this place, and we're going to worship and we're going to pray and we're going to intercede, and then you know what we're going to do? We're going to come back next Sunday night as a gathered group of communities, and we're going to do it all over again, and we are going to keep singing and keep singing and keep singing and keep singing the songs of Zion until the kingdom comes and his will is done on earth as it is in heaven, because that, my friend, is your job and mine. And so, Lord, we say to you today, we lift our eyes. We lift our eyes to the hill. Where does our help come from? Our help comes from the Lord, maker of heaven and earth. We lift our eyes to the one who is willing to come in flesh and make himself known, and we lift our eyes to the one who is present here with us now, who has not abandoned us, who has not left us, who is making all things new, and we declare that you are still king of all kings, and you are still Lord of all lords, that there is still no name like your name, that you still have no rival, that you still have no equal, that you still walk on water, that you still make lame whole, that you still make the blind see, that you still set the captives free, that you are God, and while you are God, we are in very safe hands. So we lift our eyes, and we lift our voices, and as one voice and one body, we declare that Jesus Christ is Lord. Amen.
