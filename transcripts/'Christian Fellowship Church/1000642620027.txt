I just, whenever we were worshipping there, I had a picture of, you know, whenever you're, maybe you don't know, I know because I'm a terrible driver, when you know you're about to hit something, but it's too late to do anything about it. And everything kind of, like you tense, and I had a picture of like that kind of tension in people's bodies and minds and spirits, because you've been through so much difficulty that you just like, you're just, you don't even realize you're still in grace position. And I just felt the invitation of the spirit for you to, for just a second, just to like, and instead of expecting something negative in these moments, open up your heart and your spirit to the possibility that God might be about to deliver something to you that would bring you strength and healing and hope. But actually, see, if you're like that, you're not going to be in a position to receive whatever it is he wants to give you. So I'm just going to pray over you, if that's you, I'm just going to pray over your body, your spirit, your mind, Lord, I just pray that tension that comes either from long-term difficulty or just the everyday grind of life, those who've been through something particularly difficult and have come in through, into this space, just really, really head up and tense. Pray, spirit, would you just breathe on bodies, minds, and spirits in this moment and open us up, relax us into your presence, that we might be in a fit state to receive whatever you've got for us in your name. Amen. Amen. Here we go. I hope I've got it in me. We'll see how this goes. So we've been in a series, a very short series. We tend to do it in January. We also do it in September where we look at some spiritual practices or disciplines, rhythms that we put into our lives as a part of our rule of life, which Gibbo talked about a few weeks ago. If you weren't here, I highly recommend you go back and get that talk from Gibbo. It'll really, really help you to set your year up. So these rhythms and practices, and these rhythms and practices are not the end goal. It's not that, the idea is not that in a year's time we're like, oh, we're really good prayers, you know, or I just, I'm so proud of myself because I haven't missed a day in scripture. Like I hope that that's the reality, but that's not the end goal. The practices, the rhythms, the disciplines in our lives are always for an end goal of abiding in Jesus and being made into his image. That's the end goal. The end goal is that there are no, you hardly know where he starts and you stop, you know. It's about bringing you into a place of abiding and the image of Christ being formed in you. It's about transformation. So I like to think about the spiritual disciplines in a couple of ways. I like to think about them like a potter's wheel. And every time you engage in a spiritual discipline, whether that's prayer, fasting, reading scripture, joining together in community, there's a whole variety. It's like you're putting yourself on the potter's wheel so that the Lord can start to mold anything that's deformed in you that doesn't look like Jesus, pop it back into place. So you look more like the one who has perfection. I'm totally whole, you know. What a beautiful invitation. It's like a potter's wheel. I also like to think of them though like gateways. I think that there's an invitation to you and I in a world that is operating under a different kingdom and a different rule to enter the kingdom of God. There are two kingdoms at war on the earth. There's the enemy who wants to kill, steal and destroy. And there's a kingdom of light that wants to bring us into life. And there's always an invitation through two doorways. And I feel like the spiritual practices are almost like doorways or gateways into kingdom life. When you're struggling to live the kingdom life, they're like doorways and gateways that take us into the kingdom life. And as we begin to think this morning about a practice that you may not be familiar with and you're like, is that a spiritual practice? Are you kidding me, Charlotte? Yes, it is. I'm going to show you how in a minute. As we begin to think of the spiritual practice of celebration, how we incorporate celebration into our lives, I want you to understand that celebration can become a doorway into kingdom living at a level that you're not accustomed to or I'm not accustomed to. I feel really, really convicted about this. Some of you in the room are like, celebration, party, sign me up. And some of you are like, oh, that's so fluffy. Like how can celebration make you more like Jesus? Hard work, discipline, getting up for the early morning prayer meeting, these things make us like Jesus. Celebration, don't be ridiculous, Charlotte. If that's you, I'm in your gang, okay? I'm in your gang. I'm like, sign me up for all the hard stuff. Celebration can't possibly make us like Jesus. Turns out I was wrong. It really does. And I'm going to show you it from scripture. You see, there are some things I want you to know about celebration as we enter this study. There's three things, in fact, that hopefully we'll get to that I want you to know. And the first one is this, celebration is the kingdom story. The kingdom story is literally the story of celebration. From the very opening passages in Genesis, right through the entire biblical arc to Revelation. I look, I've even made slides. The morning show didn't even get this. Look, when you say, I made all these lovely, it's morning show, what do I think I'm on TV? They didn't get my beautiful slides that I worked so hard on. Look, from the arc of scripture, right from Genesis to Revelation, the whole story is bookended and embedded with celebration. It is everywhere. If you think that Jesus doesn't like celebration, you have not read the book. I have not read the book. Right from the opening passage, whenever God is creating the world, it's like he has all of these mini celebrations. He pauses between each thing he makes. He steps back and he looks at it and goes, that's good. It's like a wee mini celebration. Then he moves on to the next thing. That's good. It all culminates in the first celebration that is ever given as a rhythm into the life of God's people of Sabbath, which is meant to be this moment where we pause and we celebrate all of the goodness of God. At the end, look at all that he's done. That is embedded in the people of God. They're called to a rhythm, a practice, a discipline of celebration once a week where they pause on the other Sabbath. You take that right over to Revelation. This is what it says in Revelation 19. Right at the end of Scripture, it says, Revelation 19 verse 6, I heard a sound, and so this is what we're going to hear at the end. It sounded like a great multitude, like the roar of rushing waters, like loud peals of thunder shouting, hallelujah, our Lord God Almighty reigns. Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory for the wedding of the lamb has come and his bride has made herself ready. Fine linen bright and clean was given her to wear. Fine linen stands for the righteous acts of God's holy people. And then the angel said to me, write this, blester those who are invited to the wedding supper of the lamb. It's a party and blester those who come. Like the whole thing is celebration right from the start to the end. The kingdom story is celebration. That's what the story is. But in order for us to understand the practice of celebration, we need a biblical definition of it. What is a biblical definition of celebration? I'm going to offer something to you that I have not really thought about before this week to be honest. But through my study this week, I have come to this. This is my definition, my definition based on my study of what biblical celebration is. I think we've got it for the screens there, Aubrey. Celebration is the response to noticing the activity of God. As I have studied every passage on celebration throughout the story, the thing that I have noticed in common when it's holy celebration is this. Celebration is the response to noticing the activity of God. I want you to think about that Genesis passage with me just for a minute. You know, I think it's a bit odd that the language, right, because this is what it says. So God makes the light, Genesis 1, and then Genesis 4, 1 verse 4, it says, God saw that the light was good. Sounds like he's weird. And then he makes like the dry ground appear, and then it says in verse 10, God saw that it was good. And then in verse 18, after he makes the sun and the moon, it says, God saw that it was good. And then it goes on like that right to the end. It says, God saw all that he made, and it was very good. The Hebrew word rah, which just literally means to say, I think that's weird. I think it makes more sense for it to be like this. God made the light, and it was good. What do you mean God saw that it was good? It's like God makes it, then God steps back, and God looks at his own activity, and it causes him to rejoice. It's good. He sees it. He notices his own activity. And then he celebrates. And I think what God is doing for us in those moments is he is inviting us into a method and a mode to access biblical celebration by teaching us how it's done. That true biblical celebration is whenever you see what he's done, and then you'll celebrate. There's something about noticing the activity of God. That's what celebration is. It's a response to noticing God's activity and action on the earth. And you and I are not going to be able to access celebration without first accessing the noticing of what God has been up to, the activity. The second thing I want you to know about celebration, though, is this. Celebration is a kingdom story, but I want you to know that the enemy hijacks celebration. See, the enemy doesn't think that celebration is fluffy. The enemy knows the power of celebration to form us into the image of Christ and to help us to access the kingdom story. So the enemy tries to hijack celebration. I've got another lovely slide. You're going to be so impressed with me today. Look at this. I mean, I should just, like, let's just sack James and I'll be the media person. This is unbelievable. Well, actually, that's never going to happen. I want you to see the wee line, because it's not enough for this arc of celebration to occur in the story. The enemy wants to cut in on the story and pervert it so it goes in a different way. The enemy wants to destroy celebration in the arc of the story and in your life, and I want to suggest to you, based on my study this week, there are a couple of ways he seems to do it most often, to take celebration from your life. The first one is this, distraction. In order to dismantle or to pervert the biblical definition of celebration, if that is noticing God's activity, what's he going to do? He's going to distract you so you don't notice God's activity, so your eyes are on something else. Let me show you a couple of times that this happens in scripture, and let me show you what happens off the back of an unbiblical celebration as a result. Let's go to Exodus for just a second. Exodus chapter 32 is where Moses has gone up the mountain. He's with God. People are at the bottom. They don't know what to do, and they make this golden calf. This is what it says. I want you to notice the language here. Exodus 32 verse 3, all the people took off their earrings, and they brought them to Aaron, and he took what they handed him, and they made it into an idol cast in the shape of a calf, fashioning it with a tool. Then they said, these are our gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt. Aaron saw this, and he built an altar in front of the calf, and he announced, tomorrow there'll be a festival to the Lord. So the next day, the people rose early, and they enter a celebration. Watch what happens. They sacrificed burnt offerings. They presented fellowship offerings, and afterward, they sat down to eat, to drink, and they got up to indulge in revelry, and when Moses comes down the mountain in verse 25, watch what Moses says about this. Moses saw that the people were running wild, and that Aaron had let them get out of control, and so become a laughingstock to their enemies. Want you to notice how that ends. They become a laughingstock to their enemies. Let me show you one more place where this happens, and then we're going to piece this together. In Esther, we see a king, and they're about to enter a whole season of celebration. Esther 1 verse 4, it says, for a full 180 days, he, that's King Xerxes, displayed the vast wealth of his kingdom, and the splendor and the glory of his majesty. Verse 8, by the king's command, each guest was allowed to drink with no restrictions. For the king instructed all the wine stewards to serve each man what he wished. Verse 10, on the seventh day, when King Xerxes was in high spirits from wine, in other words, he was bloated, he commanded the seven eunuchs who served him to bring before him Queen Vashti wearing her royal crown in order to display her beauty to the people and nobles, which she was lovely to look at. Basically what happens is they have this kind of celebration, but it's not a holy celebration. You know how I know it's not a holy celebration. Look how it ends. In Exodus, it ends with the very people who you're celebrating turning themselves into a laughingstock. They're degraded. Their celebration degrades them. It makes them less than they are, not more. It takes something from them. It shames them. And then when we read the same thing happening in Esther, it's the same thing. It seems a great celebration. It's like, oh, it's not against celebration, but there's something about this celebration that means that everybody by the end of it is so drunk they can hardly bite their finger and they're getting some beautiful woman to come and they're parading her and objectifying her and they want to parade her and objectify her in front of a whole lot of drunk men. There's nothing good about this. It's degrading. It's shameful. It's stealing. And isn't it just like the enemy to take something that's supposed to bring you into life and to make it bring you into death? What's the difference? What's the difference between holy celebration and this kind of celebration? Well, the difference is the center of the celebration. Because if holy celebration happens in response to noticing God's activity, these two celebrations are all based on human activity. This is the calf we made. Now let's celebrate it. King Xerxes, this is the success I have. Now let's celebrate my own success. God has been lifted out of the center and humanity has been put in the middle and humanity is a terrible, terrible, terrible master. There's something about the obsession with self in the middle of celebration that takes you to a place of degradation, not life. And so if the enemy can distract you, stop looking at what God's doing, look at the success of your own hands. The next step is the enemy will begin to pickpocket from you as he makes you dance all the celebration of your success and it feels so good while all the while he's pickpocketing life out of your back pocket while you're distracted. Distraction so that you no longer notice the good things God is doing and all you notice are the good things that you're doing or the good things that other people are doing. You're so distracted by humanity's activity, you miss God's activity in the middle and it ends in degradation. If the enemy can't get you with distraction, though, he'll get you another way. And this is another way we see multiple times in scripture in the narrative. In fact, this is probably the strongest way we see the enemy hijack celebration. If he can't get you by distraction, he'll get you by blindness. He'll get you by blindness. Let me show you. So remember our definition is celebration is in response to noticing God's activity. He'll just make you blind so you can't see anything. I want you to show you a couple of passages where this happens. In the book of Nehemiah, they find the book of the, they start to read the book of the law, God's word, and as they do, something a bit strange starts to happen among the people. In Nehemiah chapter eight, it says, all the people listened attentively to the book of the law. And then in verse nine of that chapter, it says, Nehemiah, the governor, Ezra, the priest and teacher of the law and the Levites who were instructing the people said to them all, this day is holy to the Lord your God. Don't mourn or weep for all the people had been weeping as they listened to the words of the law. Nehemiah said, go and enjoy choice food and sweet drinks, send some to those who have nothing prepared. This day is holy to our Lord. Don't grieve for the joy of your Lord is your strength. Let me show you what's happening here. As Nehemiah or as Ezra begins to read the book of the law, the people start to realize they've fallen really, really short of what God's asked them to do. And it's like this grief because they can see their sins so clearly. This grief begins to pour over them. It's like God, you asked for this and we gave you that and something in their hard heart snaps and they begin to grieve and they begin to cry and they begin to weep. I'm not suggesting there's anything wrong with that and I don't think that that's what's happening in the passage that there's anything wrong with that. There's a place that says there's a time to weep. There's a time to confess our sins one to another. There's a time to fast because we're like, we're so, we're so without you Lord, we're so weak and empty. There's a time for that. The problem comes is when we get stuck in that mode and all we can see is our sin and our shame and we can't see the intervention of God and salvation into that sin and shame. Because Nehemiah is like, in the book of Nehemiah, we're told, yes, all of this is true. Yes, there's sin. Yes, there's shame. But look, God's just intervened and shown you his word so that he can turn this around. This is, this is God's active. Like a minute ago, you didn't, you weren't even thinking about him and now he's done something in your heart and he's awakened you and he's saving you. Like look at what he's done. Yes, the sin is a real thing, but so is salvation. Oh, don't get stuck over there. And I meet so, so many people in Northern Irish Christian community who got stuck in the grieving and forgot about the rejoicing. They're so burdened by their own shame and their own sin and their own lack that they can't lift their heads. And I literally feel the heart of God saying, okay, maybe all of that is true, but there's a time to weep. Yes, but there's also a time to dance for you, lift your head and you notice I've stepped into that. I've stepped into your sin. I've stepped into your addiction. I've stepped into your history and your shame and all the dirt in your past. I've stepped into it. And what have I done? I've removed it as far as the East is from the West, get up and sing, you know, and there's something that has to come back to the church in Northern Ireland where we, where we don't get so stuck in the grieving. And like I said, I'm not saying that sin shouldn't be grieved. It should. But then there comes a moment, but oh, but we've been saved. Look what God's done. And then the song kicks off and the dancing starts and what was a funeral dirge turns into like a wedding party because God's doing something new. But the enemy wants to blind you, you see, to the fact that God's rescuing you in the middle of your sin and just have you so that all you can see is your sin. He's trying to blind you so that you can't get in on the dance. And that happens throughout. And even when we take this to the New Testament, you're going to see this so strongly in the ministry of Jesus, particularly around fasting and feasting and mourning and dancing. You're going to see it around Jesus. Let me show you how. When we get into the gospel of Matthew, Jesus himself says this in Matthew 11, 18, he's talking about John the Baptist, John the Baptist came neither eating nor drinking. And they said he is a demon. And then the son of man came eating and drinking and they say, oh, he's a glutton and he's a drunkard and he's a friend of tax collectors and sinners. But wisdom is proved right by our deeds. So Jesus is literally saying you're never happy guys, we can't please you because John the Baptist came and his role was to grieve and to mourn and to call forth repentance and to fast. And then the very thing that he's calling forth, the very thing that the earth is longing for, the very thing that you've been hoping for, Messiah's arrival comes and you're still over here pleading, begging, grieving and mourning. He's like, I've shown up, I'm active, I'm here, now's not the time for grieving and mourning. Now's the time for dancing and celebrating. And that's why when John the Baptist's disciples who were discipling under John the Baptist who had that role of repenting and calling forth the activity of God, calling forth the Messiah, preparing the way, and then they come, those disciples come to Jesus and they say this to Jesus, they're raging. In Matthew 9, 14, John's disciples came and asked him, how is it that the Pharisees fast often but your disciples don't fast? How come we and the Pharisees are over here fasting and you lot are sitting down to dinner all the time? You're literally always at a dinner party all the time. This can't be right. And Jesus says this, how can the guests of the bridegroom mourn when he's with them? Time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them and then they'll fast again. But right now, I'm active, here's the reality. There was something about those disciples that came and asked that question and the Pharisees where they were blind to the activity of God so they couldn't get in on the dancing. They were still looking for a salvation that had already come. They were still looking for a Messiah, the Pharisees were still looking for a Messiah that had already arrived. They hadn't noticed that God was working so they couldn't get in on the dancing. And the enemy will do that to you. He will so blind you by everything else that you will, God will be working in your life and you will no longer be able to see it so you'll not be able to get in on the dancing. It'll be like there's nothing to celebrate here because he blinds you to the activity because true, holy, joyful, robust celebration is always a response to noticing the activity of God. So he'll try to blind you. So when Jesus shows up, he's always saying, the kingdom's near. The kingdom's near. Like he says all the time. Jesus talks about the kingdom more than nearly anything else because he's like, you've been pleading and begging and wanting the kingdom to come. When it shows up, don't miss it. The kingdom is near, get in on the dancing. This is the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The kingdom is near. Get in on the dancing. It's not far away. God's not out of reach. He's not separate. He's not divided from you. God is here. He is present. He is active. The kingdom is here. Come in, get in on the dancing. There is a call. And the reality is if we note that the story is the kingdom story of celebration, the enemy is trying to hijack it. The third thing I want you to notice is this. It's a church's job to redeem the story of celebration. It's literally our job because if Jesus was calling, the kingdom is near, the kingdom is near. God's active. Don't miss him. Get in on the dancing. That mantle passes to the church. The mantle of proclaiming the arrival of the kingdom of God into a world that is sorrowing, grieving, on its knees, broken, hopeless. The activity of announcing the arrival of the kingdom of God, oh, don't miss him. He's here. He's active. There's an invitation. That mantle passes to the church. And you and I become those who declare the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ, which is this. God's not far away. He's here. He's active. He's doing something. So there is a dance afoot for those who notice that he's here. Augustine famously said that the Christian should be a hallelujah from head to foot. The Christian should be a hallelujah from head to foot. He's not wrong. The Christian should be a hallelujah from head to foot. Because we're supposed to be the ones that have noticed that God's active. If everybody else is blind in the world to the activity and the action of God, we're supposed to be the ones running around shouting, the kingdom is here, declaring it. But some of us are struggling to even do that in our own lives. And some of you are sitting there today, and I have no desire to diminish your grief or your difficulty or your challenge. You know me well enough to know that I would not do that. I have no desire to do that. And you're saying to me, celebrate Charlotte. I can't. And if there's something in your heart saying celebrate, I can't. My response and love to you as your pastor is this, you must. You must. Especially when you feel like you can't. Because Nehemiah says the words in Nehemiah 8, the joy of the Lord will be your strength. And the thing about grief and hardship and difficulty is it's wearying. It gets so deep into your bones that you just think, I cannot do another day. What you need more than anything when you're suffering is strength. But the joy of the Lord will be your strength. And so if you're unable to celebrate, you'll be unable to access the very strength that you need to see you through this season. You see, celebration, Christian celebration, the world celebration is not always accessible. It's only accessible when things are going well. Christian celebration is always accessible because God is always active. Christian celebration is always accessible because God is always active. The problem is sometimes we're blind to it. And there is an invitation to notice. I want you to take a moment and look around the room. And I want you to memorize in your head every red or pink thing that you see. Make a list. I'm going to test you on it in a minute. Every red or pink thing that you see. Okay, close your eyes. In your head, I want you to make a mental list of every blue thing in the room. Open your eyes. Look around at how much blue things there are in the room. Stacks. Could you think of them a minute ago? No. It wasn't that they weren't here. You weren't looking for it. You see what you look for. You see what you seek for. And if you're not looking for the activity of God, you will miss it. Not because he's not active, but because you weren't looking for it. Because you don't have the practice of looking for the activity of God, noticing him especially in the hard times. And so what you look for, you see. And then when you see him, you can celebrate. And then when you celebrate, you'll have strength. That's how this works. So if the enemy can hijack that process and keep you waking on the floor, he's going to do it every time. So is celebration a discipline? Yes. It's a choice. It's a discipline. It's not some airy-fairy thing. It is getting up and deciding, I am going to search for the activity of God because I know if I look for him, I'm going to see him. But the thing is, some of us, I think, and the only reason I can say this is because I have experienced this, some of us have a really small receptacle for joy. So the only tiny bit can get in, and here's why. You're only looking for God to move in a very specific way. For example, whenever Drew and I got married, we couldn't have kids. Several years went by and we couldn't have kids. And you know what happened to me in that season? I got so hard-hearted. Was it because God wasn't active in my life? Oh, he's doing a bunch of things. Could I see any of them? No. All I could see is the one thing I wanted him to do that he wasn't doing. And I wrote that into my life as God's not active, he's left me. Was God not active? He's doing a million things, but I was so tunnel-visioned. I was just looking at the one thing I wanted him to do that he wasn't doing. And you know what it's like? It's like a tantrum in toddler. I was like a tantrum in toddler, screaming as my mum gave me the pink unicorn socks because I'd suddenly decided I wanted the blue ones and nothing else would do. Only the blue ones. Only the blue ones. Only the blue ones. She's like, I've 92 different pairs of socks I want to offer you, but all you want is the blue ones. I was like a tantrum in toddler, if I can't have that, I don't want anything. And something had to happen in my spirit where that was broken by him, and I'm so grateful that it was. Before we ever had kids, God had to break that in me. I'm so grateful that he did. And that doesn't diminish the pain of that season. That season was extremely painful. Those of you who have navigated that know what that's like, it's extremely painful. But there was an opportunity for joy I'd missed because my receptacle was too small. Imagine what had happened, right? So I only want this one thing, God to do this one thing, so it's the only thing I'm looking for. And he's not doing it, not doing it. Imagine if I just widen that and start to look for other things that God might be doing in my life. Like, oh, he's given me this actually, and he spoke to me here, and thank you for that thing that happened and that answer to prayer. And imagine if I just looked wider in my life than the one thing I've been praying about all the time. Or imagine if I looked just like a little bit wider again in my life, and I started to think about all the things he did yesterday, not just today. What about the things he did 10 years ago, which is going to forget about them? Because when I notice that, I'm going to be poised for more celebration. Or what about this for a novel idea? What if we widen it beyond ourselves? And we begin to look for the activity of God in other people's lives, not just ours, and that becomes a source of celebration, not jealousy. See, that's why the prodigal son can't sit at the table. There's a feast led, not the prodigal son, his big brother. That's why he can't sit at the table. It's not because there's no feast. It's not because there's no dancing, and it's not because it's not in his vicinity. He's literally an arm away, but he can't sit at the table because he's not the focus of the feast. He can't get in on the dancing because he's not the focus of the feast. And our receptacle for joy will widen if we begin to celebrate God's activity, not just in our lives, but in the lives of other people. Or what about this for a novel thought? What if we widen it and we start to think wider than our own wee patch of land, and we start to think, what's God doing around the world? All of a sudden, you're going to have a million things on your list that God's doing. Or what if we widen it eschatologically, and we don't just think about the past and the present, but we think about what God's promised to do in the future. All the activity and action he's already put into place so that one day every tear will be wiped away and everything will be made whole. All of a sudden, there's a lot of things to be joyful about. But biblical celebration is response to noticing the action of God. And if we are blind to it, we're never going to be able to celebrate. But if we're open to it, celebration is always accessible, and celebration will bring you the strength that you need. It's a discipline. So let me get real practical for a minute and offer you a couple of things. You're like, class, but what do we do with this? Because what we don't want to do is just be better informed. We want to be transformed. So we want to take whatever we're learning and get it to bed into our lives. So a couple of things to suggest. I think there are already some Christian celebrations that we need to think about. So like Sabbath, for example. I do Sabbath 24 hours every single week. I've been doing it now for maybe six years. It's not wild. I've been a Christian for that long and I've never done proper Sabbath. And honestly, my husband will tell you, I am a nicer person to live with because of my Sabbath. That has looked different over that time. Let me give you a little window into some of it. For me, my Sabbath starts on a Thursday evening and goes to a Friday evening. So if you text me on a Friday and I do not respond, do not be offended. I am on my Sabbath. And it will start with a meal with our kids and a relaxing evening. If it's cold outside, the fire will go on and we'll just breathe our way into the Sabbath day. My Sabbath day. I don't practice Sabbath the same day as Drew because he works on a Friday and I do not. And then my morning, on a Friday morning, I will just focus on Jesus as much as I can. I'm just trying to turn my eyes back to him as much as I can. I'll talk to him about everything that's troubled my heart that week. I'll pour out my whole life before him. I'll listen. I'll just be super attentive because here's the thing, right? People think Sabbath's really hard because you're like, what do you mean you just spend like time with Jesus? Jesus is the most whole person you know. Everybody else is broken. You know, everybody, let's be honest, everybody else is melt and Jesus isn't. Like he's literally the wholest person you know. So see when you get to know him, spending time with Jesus is literally my favorite thing. Like I would love to be a monk, but he hasn't allowed me. There's something about being with him. So I'm just really, really attentive. But this week after learning this, right? And then if Drew's about, we'll maybe go for a nice coffee or do something. It's not like that. When the kids were small, you know, it's not always accessible depending on, but you find your way to make the day sacred and holy. But after this week, I'm bringing a new practice into my Sabbath and my new practices at the start of Friday morning, maybe, or Thursday night, I'm going to take just 10 or 15 minutes to notice the activity of God that week. What have you been doing this week in my life, Lord? I'm not going to be ignorant to your goodness. I'm going to spend some time and I'm going to notice it. I think that needs to be redeemed back into our current Christian celebrations. I also think the same thing needs to happen with Christmas and Easter, by the way. Listen, I love a good Christmas tradition like the rest of them. I still got my Christmas wreath on my door. You know what I mean? I'm not adverse to making a wreath, sticking it on the door, doing some nice Christmas activities. I'm not adverse to any of that. Please do not hear what I'm not saying. Please don't hear what I'm not saying. But what I'm saying is the whole point of Christmas and Easter is to notice the activity of God. It's to slow your spirit down enough that you notice him, that he came in flesh and dwelt among us. It's like if you're driving along in a car and it's going fast, you can't see a thing out the window. You slow it down, all of a sudden you start to notice all kinds of things. I think what's happened to Christmas and perhaps Easter to a lesser extent is it's become faster and not slower. We want to do all of these things. There's all of these opportunities to do all of these things. I think the enemy's hijacking it a wee bit, I'm going to be honest. Because our pace moves to such a pace that we notice Jesus less, not more. Which is the opposite of the point. It's supposed to slow you down so that you notice him. Because if you notice him, true celebration will rise up in your heart and your joy will come back that you've lost. Same with Easter. We're supposed to slow down and take extended time noticing the activity and the action of God because that will spark joy that you've lost in your heart and that will bring you strength. So I think some of the Christian celebrations need to be redeemed again, now that we know what biblical celebration is. I also want to suggest that some secular celebrations we could probably hijack them. Like, give me a wave if it's your birthday in January. Have we any January birthdays? Hiya, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, happy birthday. We'll sing happy birthday. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, all you January birthdays. Happy birthday to you. What if, right? Because the birthday's coming, whether you want it to come or not, love, it's coming. What about when the birthday comes, we look at the birthday people and we say, you know what you are? You're evidence of the activity of God on the earth. You're evidence, young squire, of God's action and activity on the earth. You are. Amanda, you're evidence of God's action and activity on the earth. He's your prayer and his image. He's not done with the world. He's just put his image in you, in the world. You're evidence of his activity. Yes, class. And what about on your birthday? You stop and you say, let's note all the things God's done this year for me. Let's notice all the things God's done. What if we redeem birthdays? What if we redeem New Year's? What if we redeem food? I love my dinner. Like I just love my dinner so much. You never had to tell me to clear my plate unless there was turnip on it and then maybe needed a wee bit of work. I love my dinner. What about, like Jesus loved a good meal. What about every time you sit down to eat, just for a moment, you pause and you redeem that celebration and you say, what have I seen God do since the last time I ate? For some of you, that did not be much of a window, but God will still be active if you're a snacker. What if you stop and every time you eat, you just pause and you think, what have I seen God? What's God been up to since the last time I ate? I just start to redeem the celebration. I promise you, right, I haven't tried it, but I promise you anyway. I promise you, I am 100% convinced that if we did that this week, we'd just pay so much attention to the activity of God, I reckon that we would be much more joyful by the end of the week than we were at the start. You see, the enemy's trying to persuade you that joy is inaccessible, particularly for some of you in the season that you're in. Oh, joy's out of your reach. The list changes. Joy's out of your reach. Is it? Is it? I don't think so. I think it's time for the church to redeem celebration. And then maybe when people meet Christians like Augustine, they'll be said, those Christians are hallelujah from head to foot. Maybe we'll be known for our joy instead of that miserable lot, wouldn't go near them. There's an invitation to celebration, but it is a discipline. I wonder what you'll do with that this week. I'm going to invite you to stand. Tim's going to come. Thank you for listening. And as the team get ready, just to lead us in a final song, I want you to just close your eyes for a wee minute and think about how you can put this into practice this week. What's the one thing you could do to redeem celebration? Yeah, Lord, we thank you. You're not far away, that you are the God who dwells among us. And actually for those of us who know and love you, you're the God who dwells in us. Like you're not far away and you're not passive. I just thank you that we can be really sure that this week you're going to be active in our lives. But Lord, we do ask for eyes to see and ears to hear what you're doing. Would you heal us of our blindness and forgive us, Lord, for, forgive us for the really bad attitude some of us have developed, perhaps through pain or difficulty or just a long season. Lord, we don't want to be downcast. Why so downcast, oh my soul? Put your hope in God. So we just pray over the spirit of heaviness and the spirit of despair that has cloaked some people in this room and we pray that this week you would give them the capacity to shake that off with celebration. To shake off, shake off the spirit of heaviness. Shake it off now. It doesn't fit. It doesn't fit a child of God. Shake it off. I pray, Father, you'd give them the capacity to shake off the spirit of heaviness and despair with the discipline of celebration, of noticing your activity. Give us eyes to see, give us ears to hear what you're doing this week. We pray in your name. Amen. Amen.
