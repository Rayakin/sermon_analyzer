Welcome to the CFC podcast. Before we get stuck in, I'd like to take a minute to let you know about our Compassion Appeal. Every year, CFC's Compassion Appeal impacts thousands of lives across Northern Ireland. People struggling with basic needs like putting food on the table, keeping warm and getting school uniforms for their children. The book of James that we've been studying is very clear about our responsibility to outwork our faith in our actions, and the Compassion Appeal is a great way to do that. If you'd like to join us in making a real difference in the lives of those who need it most, head to thisisscfc.com, that's thisisscfc.com, where you can give to this year's appeal and see what a difference your generosity makes. Thank you. Never gets any easier watching yourself on video, honestly. Oh dear, a few more wrinkles than last year, what? Well, I didn't want to say, but yep. Absolutely unnecessary. It's so good to be with you this morning, and welcome to our sites at South, and East and Hollywood. It's brilliant to have you guys with us joining in as well, and of course CAFE, who join in every week. Bit of a different setup today, guys, and we're looking over the next three weeks at what makes us us, who are we at CFC, what has God called us to do, and who we are as a church family. We try to have a teaching liturgy across the year, and every year in November we try to do our vision and values, and one of the values at CFC that we want to unpack this morning is the priesthood of all believers, the belief that brings a removal to any class, hierarchical structure to our status as followers of Jesus. It brings an equality and a value to everyone in God's kingdom, and essentially to the roles that each person is gifted and that they undertake in the serving of God. So we at CFC believe that all roles and functions and giftings are open to both male and female. There's no office, position, or ministry that is off limits depending on your maleness or your femaleness. As we look across our sites, we have women in leadership, women who preach, lead, and teach, women who serve as elders, and we believe they are chosen, equipped, called into what God has for them. This is often described as an egalitarian form of church leadership and not complementarian, which would look to put some restriction on women carrying out certain roles within the church. Well, that's all very well, Gable, but why do you believe that? Why do we believe that at CFC, and why does it matter? Why have we come to this understanding through scripture? Because scripture really matters to us at CFC. So Charlotte, why have we? Yeah, I think it's important to start with why does it matter? I think in a moment like this, we can think, why are we having a chat about this on a Sunday morning? Like surely you can talk about something more interesting, but it does matter. This discussion does matter for lots of reasons, but let me just offer you two before we get into this discussion. It matters because it's a stewardship issue. We believe that the Holy Spirit allocates gifts as He sees fit, that you or I do not get to choose what gifts the Father gives to us by His Spirit. And so if a female is given certain gifts, say teaching or leadership, then she has to figure out, as every man does too, how to steward those gifts so that she or he might stand before the Father someday and say, I've been faithful with what you've given me. And so it's a stewardship issue to start to think about how women function in those spaces and those places and what scripture has to say about it. But it's not just about women stewarding their gifts, it is a body issue. We also believe that the body of Christ is just that, it's a body. And again, we don't get to decide whether we're a lung or a kidney or a lymph node, you know. We don't get to decide where we're positioned, what we're appointed or chosen to do. The Father has all decision-making rights on all of those things. But the reality is, if a kidney is allocated to be a kidney, it must function as a kidney for the whole body to flourish. It's not just about the kidney flourishing, it's about the entire body flourishing. And we believe that the entire body does not flourish until every single member of that body operates in the space, the place, the capacity and the empowerment of the Spirit where they have been allocated. And so this discussion is super important, not just for females who have specific kinds of gifts, but in fact for the flourishing and the well-being of the body. So we're going to start today. What we're going to do is we're going to take a grand overview of Scripture, okay? I hope you brought your pack lunch because we're starting at Genesis and we're definitely going right through the New Testament. And there's two preachers today, so you know what I mean, it's going to be doubly long-winded. But we're going to start today. We are going to go back to Genesis, but we're going to start, you want to begin the discussion in Acts. So I'm going to read from Acts as we begin. If you've got your Bible, feel free to pull it out there. It will be in Acts chapter 2 to begin with before we track back to Genesis. And this is what it says in Acts 2. When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place and suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. And all of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them. Verse 14 says, then Peter stood up with the 11 and he raised his voice and he addressed the crowd. Fellow Jews, and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you. Listen carefully to what I say. These people are not drunk as you suppose, it's only nine in the morning. No, this, this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel. In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy. Your young men will see visions. Your old men will dream dreams. Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days and they will prophesy. I will show wonders in the heavens above and signs in the earth below and blood and fire and billows of smoke. The sun will be turned to darkness, the moon to blood before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord and everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. So the day of Pentecost comes, the people are gathered in one place. There is with one accord, there is unity here, there's unity of person and there's unity of place and the Spirit comes on all. I think that's super significant. The church receives the power that Jesus had promised. Both male and female in that church receive the power that Jesus has promised. And Peter then stands up and he declares what is actually going on, that this is the fulfillment of a prophecy given by Joel. This is the pouring out of the Spirit on all flesh, on all people. But for what? It's poured out for a purpose. Well, what is the purpose? Part of the purpose is revealed here and will continue to be revealed throughout the New Testament. Part of the purpose here is it's pouring out that the sons and the daughters will prophesy. Male and female will prophesy. The word for prophesy here in the Greek is propheteo and it means, listen carefully, to divinely teach or to speak forth properly in divine power. You have male and female being equipped and gifted here, having the Spirit poured out to speak forth in divine power. There is teaching, speaking in power from God, all caught up in this declaration of what both male and female will do. And so why start here instead of in Genesis with the re-in Genesis, Charlotte, back, right? But we're starting here because this is how the church was birthed. And we believe the church should continue in this way with both male and female carrying out their God-gifted and equipped ministries. Indeed, all of the gifts are given to all of the body, the church, male and female. Nowhere in Scripture are certain gifts kept for men and women respectively. There is, however, clear scriptural clarity around all of the gifts being for all of the body and all should desire them, as Paul tells us, and not be ignorant of them. In 1 Corinthians 12, 14, as Paul is outlining what these gifts are, part of that section, that's the moment for a mandate. That's the moment for Paul to say, these are the gifts given for some, but these are the gifts given for others, but it's just not there. Instead, here we read the invitation for all to live into this dual prophecy. And so actually what I would say this, it's not a new thing that is being birthed here in the church, but it's a restoration of what always has been. It's actually not a new thing, it's the restoration of an original thing. And so at the birth of the church, at this new creation moment, there are echoes of the Genesis creation moment where you have male and female receiving divine image and likeness upon them. They get to be the ones together, both male and female, made in the image of God who get to carry his image and his likeness together into the world that God has placed. This is not new, it's rather original. You and I get to be what God has called us and made us to be. Eden echoes here in the words and the prophecy of Joel and now it continues into the church. And so nothing brings Charlotte more delight when we say the words Eden, because that means we're going back to Genesis. So what do we learn there? I love Genesis so much. Really? Who knew? Only Genesis 1, 2 and 3 guys. So yeah, it takes us right back to the creation moment. But the reason for all joking aside, the reason I love Genesis 1 and 2 so much is because the whole story is moving back to the garden. The whole story is the fact that the Lord is restoring all things and that's where we get to in Revelation. And so to have a glimpse of how things were before things fell apart is essential because then we understand the trajectory of the story that we as the church are living into. We're not living into a Genesis 3 story, the fallenness, we're living into the restoration of Genesis 1 and 2. That's the trajectory of the story. So we have to go back to before the fall to see what's happening there, to see what trajectory the church should be on. So let me read to you from Genesis 1 verse 27 and it says this. So God created mankind in his own image. In the image of God, he created them male and female. He created them and God blessed them and said to them, be fruitful, increase in number, fill the earth, subdue it, rule over the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, over every living creature that moves in the ground. And God said, I give you every seed bearing plant in the face of the whole earth, every tree that has fruit with seed in it, they will be yours for food and to all the beasts of the earth, the birds in the sky, the creatures that move on the ground, everything that has breath of life in it, I give every green plant for your food and it was so. And God saw all that he had made and it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day, thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their fast array by the seventh day, God had finished the work he'd been doing. So on the seventh day, he rested from all his work. He blessed the seventh day, made it holy because on it, he rested from his work and the creating that he had done, the very good of God. And the question you and I need to ask is what does the very good of God look like? Because that's what we want to see restored. And the very good of God looks like his image being held in male and female. The image of God is held collectively in male and female, not one or the other distinctively, but the pair together, the image of God is held together in male and female. And I think what's important as we begin this discussion about what does the scriptures authorize women to do is to go back to the beginning and ask, is there a differentiation in the authority given to a man or a woman in the space in the original story? And the answer is no. He called them and together he said to them, rule over. Not you rule over, but not so much for you. Together he calls them to rule and to reign and there is no differentiation in the beginning of the story in terms of authority given to the male or to the female. Some people will rightly ask the question, but what does that mean about Genesis 2.18 Charlotte, where it says, the Lord says, it's not good for the man to be alone. I'll make a helper suitable for him. That helper being Eve, the female. Does that not sound subordinate? We're not saying that the main protagonist is the man and the female will be his helper or his assistant or his secretary or whatever that is in that space. Is that not what the word, and in the English, I can totally see how you get there. The problem is you cannot get there in the Hebrew. You can't get there in the Hebrew because the original word for helper in Hebrew is the word easer, which means helper. And when that word is used, it's used multiple times throughout the Old Testament. When that word is used, it is used most often to describe God. God is my easer. God is my helper. So Exodus 18, Deuteronomy 33, Psalm 33, Psalm 70, Psalm 115, Hosea 13, all of those spaces. God is my helper. God is my helper. God is my helper. He's my easer, my easer, my easer. So when God says that man needs an easer in the female, it's not used in a subordinate way. It's used to describe this beautiful strength that comes in that brings a partnership that makes the thing successful. So it's not subordination in the term. I can understand how we get there in the English. We cannot get there in the Hebrew without making some inferences about God that we cannot hold up. And so Genesis 1 and 2 set up shared authority with no restriction on the authority of a man or a woman in that setting. Then we have Genesis 3, and interestingly, it's when we hit Genesis 3 that we're going to see deep complexity and brokenness enter into that dynamic. However, while Genesis 3 definitely shapes the rest of the story, it's shaping your world and my world right now. The reality is the good, the very good of God does not go missing in the Old Testament. And we begin to see a trail, a thread of both men and women carrying authority God ordained throughout the Old Testament scriptures. It's there if you have eyes to see it. Yeah. It's interesting. We see in Genesis 3 that at that point, the language of ruling over comes into play and the power dynamic, which is in stark contrast to the very good. But when we track, and it is there, and hopefully we'll see this morning that it is there. When we track the original Genesis dynamic and the good of God and live into that, and as a church we want to live into the ideal and the good of God, the original of God, we see that there's a scriptural story being told where both the original design of male and female co-leading and equality is tracked through, and we can see that. So therefore it's hugely significant when we take that easer title that is given to Eve in Genesis, when we track that through and we come not too far from Genesis, but we come to Exodus and we see in the first two chapters of Exodus that there are five easers all playing their role as lead and actually as a strong rescuer. There's a big element of that word easer when you track it through scripture, that means a strong rescuer and we see actually five women here, easers playing their role in the Exodus account. Without Shephra, Peuah, Miriam, Jochebed and Pharaoh's daughter, Moses would not have survived. If they had not rescued him, he could not have rescued others. Miriam continues her role as easer and leads then as a prophetess. She leads in dance, she leads in song, she leads the people and her role must not be underplayed. This is a leadership position within the people of Israel. She's shaping the theology of her people and the interpretation of God's activity in their lives. That's what a prophetess did. And so we have easers in the female as rescuers and we have easer in the male as Moses also as rescuer. It's really important that we also look along other biblical sources and other outside biblical sources. The Talmud is really interesting. It lists seven other prophetesses in the Old Testament alongside Miriam who carried out this role. You have Deborah, Sarah, Hannah, Huldah, Abigail and Esther. As we said, there's a track through the Old Testament that we mustn't miss or overlook. We're going to look at a few of these women now just to show this thread of female leadership and the important role that women played in the Old Testament in leadership and in the history of Israel as a nation at key moments. Again, the purpose of this, guys, is to set the topic of women in leadership in its broad biblical narrative. It's not just to take one particular section in the New Testament and base our whole theology on a few verses in a letter written in the New Testament. Will we deal with those verses written in a particular letter in the New Testament? Yes we will. In fact, have we dealt with those? Yes we have. In a whole video? So we pre-recorded a particular deep dive into 1 Timothy 2 verse 8 to 15 in a style very similar to this. It'll be on YouTube this afternoon. We're not ducking passages which would seem to contradict our theology. Rather we're going into those passages and explaining how we get to where we get to by looking at those passages in their context. So that's going to be available this afternoon. Set your phones. 2.30 guys. So exciting. Forget Sky Sports Super Sunday. All of the men in the room, and some of the women too, know what I'm talking about with Sky Sports Super Sunday. Leeds played yesterday, so you don't need to worry. We won a game. Come on. Anyway. Sorry, getting back to your point. Help him. Co-leading in leadership. Brilliant. You're such an Easer, Charlotte, aren't you? Yeah, we're going to deep dive. We deep dive into that passage, which is interesting, and enjoy it as you watch and email any issues. Anyway. Picking up on the thread, to me, yeah, not to Charlotte, picking up on this issue of women leading throughout Scripture, again, broad biblical context. We're not just narrowing in on one particular aspect of the New Testament. We're looking at it in a broad context, and from there we'll go into the passages with everything else that we've gleaned and learned. We then take that into the passage such as is in 1 Timothy. We look at Deborah, for example. What do you do with Deborah? Deborah was a judge. Deborah was a ruler. She was a leader of Israel. She's also referred to as a prophetess. Alongside all of that, she was a singer and a songwriter too. This woman had multi-leadership roles within the land of Israel. The only other person who seemed to move in a similar varied role to her was Samuel. She keeps high esteemed company, does Deborah. She led the nation under God's authority. What do you do with her? You stand and you accept her position as a leader, as an easer, in the Genesis original design. We look at Huldah, for example, this character who may be small in terms of written words, but let's look at the influence on a nation, and I would say the influence still today that we live in the good of. Here's why. Huldah, who John Dixon writes this of, was a particularly curious example of spiritual leadership. Not only did she deliver an authoritative message to King Josiah concerning all of Judah, but she also validated the authority of the newly discovered book of the law of the Lord. We may not even have our scriptures were it not for Huldah's intervention. Second Kings 22 and Second Chronicles 34 will tell you more about that. Some have said, actually interesting regarding Huldah and Deborah, that this is what happens when men don't step up into their space. God had to use these women because there were no men around. You may have heard that, or that has been said. Can I read you some of the names of the contemporaries of Huldah that King Josiah could have gone to? Jeremiah, Zephaniah, Nahum, and Habakkuk. Who are those guys? Audience participation. What did they do? They're prophets who wrote books in the Old Testament. Some pretty good male options alongside Huldah as well, as well as some good female ones. These scriptures that Huldah played a key part and a big part in holding up, continue to live into and show the beauty of equality and role being carried out by men and women. It carries these scriptures all the way through into the New Testament too, where we meet Jesus and the New Testament. I think that that's a key place to pick up. The question is, what does Jesus do with women? What is his approach? Some of you may be asking the question, and again, it's a good one, but Jesus didn't have any female disciples. He did have female disciples. I think what we mean when we say that is the 12, none of them were female, and that's absolutely accurate. Not none of the 12 were female, they were all male. We have to ask why they were all male though, and we have to deep dive in what we're suggesting. If we're saying that women can't take places of authority because all 12 were male, let's think about what that means. Why were all 12 male? In fact, let's go before that. Why are there 12? Why does Jesus not have 13, 14, 11, or 7? Jesus has 12 disciples because this is symbolic, deeply symbolic in a way that you or I in our contemporary society don't recognize, because it's a push back into the story, the Jewish story of the 12 tribes of Israel, the 12 sons, the sons of Jacob that take up tribal leadership, and there are 12 of them, and they are 12 men. It is no surprise that we have 12 male disciples, and if we are by that inferring that only men can take leadership because Jesus had 12 male disciples, what we must also infer is then only Jews can take leadership because they were also all Jews. Does that mean that there's no space for Gentiles in the story of what God's writing and that Gentiles can't lead? Well, if that's the case, we're all scuppered because we don't believe that, so that's not an inference that we can make because Jesus' 12 male disciples, those specific 12 is symbolic. It's not prescriptive, and never anywhere does Jesus say that it's prescriptive. It's symbolic of what has been and what will be. It is not prescriptive of what the only way that leadership can occur, and to say that Jesus does not have any female disciples is simply inaccurate. Let me read you from the scriptures. It says in Luke 8, this is Jesus going out on his ministry tours, so he takes with him. Luke 8, verse 1 says this, after this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, so these are his ministry tours, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The 12 were with him and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases. Then he goes to list them, Mary called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had come out, Joanna, the wife of Tusa, the manager of Herod's household, Susanna, and many others, and these were women who helped to support them from their own means. Jesus is not traveling, his group of followers, of disciples who are on these ministry tours with him, there are women there too, and that's really, really important to note. I think that as you move on, you begin to see Jesus defend some of these women in these spaces. Some of you will know the context of Luke 10, whenever Mary is sitting at Jesus' feet, and it says in Luke 10, 39, this is Martha had a sister called Mary who sat at the Lord's feet listening to what he said, and it causes a bit of chaos in the house that day, and Jesus defends Mary's right to sit at his feet. It's really important to note is that that, in its context, is the posture of a student at the feet of their rabbi being trained or learning, and when Martha says Mary should get up and come over here and help me, Jesus says she's chosen the better part, it will not be taken from her. It won't be taken, I will not allow it to be taken from her, as she studies at the feet of her rabbi and prepares for what God has for her too, and so we have these disciples that are in this group, but just in case you think that they're just kind of hanging around the edges and they're not really given anything to do, there are multiple moments where we're shown that Jesus entrusts very specifically things to these women. Let me give you a couple of examples. Whenever we get into the Gospel of John, one of the key things about Jesus' ministry is the revelation of his identity. He paces that really, really carefully. There'll be moments where you'll see Jesus say things like, don't tell anybody else what I told you, because Jesus is very strategic in the revelation of his identity, because he's got the schemes and the plans of heaven in his mind, and so when Jesus begins to reveal his identity, it's always a really, really big moment. When we get to the Gospel of John, we're going to find him meeting a lovely Jewish man called Nicodemus, who wants to know some things, and he comes and he asks Jesus some questions and he's kind of leaning into identity talk, but Jesus doesn't reveal his identity clearly to Nicodemus, but just one chapter later, he has a discussion with a female Gentile at a well, and she is the first person who receives this news. In John 4, verse 25, the woman says, I know that Messiah, the Christ, is coming, and when he comes, he will explain everything to us, and then Jesus declared to her by herself, a female Gentile, I am the one speaking to you, I am he. It's the revelation of who he is, of his messiahhood, and who is it given to? It's given to a female Gentile at a well with no other audience, and Jesus at no point says to that woman, don't go tell anyone else. In fact, we witness her in the next moments run into town and tell everybody else that he is the messiah, because she has been entrusted with a revelation that must be shared, that's not to be held back, and she's a female entrusted with that revelation, and that way of things carries on throughout the New Testament. In the book of John, in the gospel of John, there are seven I am statements, they're very, very rich, scholarly thoughts, like scholars pour over these I am's, I am the shepherd, I am the resurrection of the life, I am the light of the world, there's seven statements, all of them are given to groups of people, that makes a lot of sense, if you're going to say something important, give it to a group so it can't be misrepresented. There's one of them that's given to one person to carry, entrusted to one person to carry by themselves, and that is a woman. Because Martha, after her brother dies, goes out to meet Jesus, and this is what Jesus says to Martha, a deep theological conversation happens with a smart woman at the well, and happens with Martha, in John 11 verse 24, Martha answered, I know he will rise again, that's her brother Lazarus, in the resurrection at the last day, and Jesus looks at her and he says this, I am the resurrection and the life. And that is entrusted to one female, and if she does not pass that on, that does not get passed on. There is an entrustment happening, and that builds right through to his resurrection, whenever the women gather and they're the first to find out that Jesus has been raised from the dead. And Jesus says this in John 20, Jesus said to her, Mary, she turned towards him and she cried out in Aramaic, which means teacher, isn't that interesting? And Jesus said, do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father, and this is what he says, go instead to my brothers and tell them, tell them that I am ascended to my Father, and your Father, to my God, and your God, go and tell my brothers. And she's entrusted with a revelation that must be shared, and not shared to a female only audience, but go tell my brothers what's happened. Because Jesus is living into the very good of God, because he is the very good of God. And that continues, it doesn't stop with Jesus, it continues on throughout the New Testament. Yeah, I mean, you could draw on many examples of women teaching and leading throughout the New Testament, operating, and this sort of brings us back the way around again until where we started with the Holy Spirit being poured out on the church, equipping all parts of the body to fulfill and perform the functions and the giftings that God has given them. We see examples, and I'm going to suggest this to you as well, which you can go and look at. We all know about the five-fold ministry, don't we? Nod heads vigorously. For those watching online, everybody's nodding their head, because this is a super-educated theological church, right? Richard, what are they? Five-fold ministry, what are they? He gave some to be teachers, preachers, pastors, prophets, evangelists, last one, did we get them all? Okay, well, here we go. This is where scripture's really helpful, because it tells us. Let's look at Acts 16. Junia is mentioned, that's a woman, as outstanding among the apostles, apostle. Philip is mentioned as having four daughters, who are all described as being what? Prophetesses, prophets. Acts 21.9, by the way, if you want to reference these and check these, please do so. Acts 21.9 is Philip's four daughters. Junia, Acts 16, is the apostle. Judea and Sintia were evangelists, talked about in Philippians 4, verse 2-3, that's three. Phoebe was a deacon, a church shepherd or leader, one who was in charge of others, Romans 16, one and two, that's a teacher, that's a leader, a pastor. Priscilla, who was a co-worker of Paul, was a teacher, instructing Apollos in the way of God more accurately. Imagine being Apollos, eh? Getting pulled aside by Priscilla. You know what our Priscilla's like? Imagine what that Priscilla's like, eh? And instructing him in the way of God more accurately, and that's in Acts 18, verse 24-26. Apostle, prophet, evangelist, teacher, shepherd, pastor, it's interesting, isn't it? These are examples of how the gifts of the Spirit were in use throughout the early church and how the body thrived and grew. Not to mention the numerous other women mentioned in various church roles throughout all areas of ministry in the New Testament, Tabitha, all in the New Testament, Lydia, Tryphena, Tryphosa, Persia, Julia, Neurus' sister, Chloe, Nympha, Lois, Eunice, Claudia, and Apphia. There's a lot, isn't there? This hopefully, guys, as we've taken time this morning to go through this, sets a wider biblical lens, which then allows us, once we've gone through that, to then go and narrow down on specific texts, have a broader base to then look at in more depth. We take all of what was covered today, and we then take that into the context of some of the letters of Paul in the New Testament and look into them and what do they mean and what can they mean. As I say, 2.30 this afternoon, check in. I'll be checking, and he's watching as well. He can't do that, he's Irish. I can't do that. Like and subscribe. I'm only joking. Don't do that. Just watch it. If you're interested, of course. But how do we deal with those texts? That's really important. For those of you who really want to know, some of you have worked this out a long time ago. I know a lot of you are sitting there going, thanks for telling me what I already knew. You're welcome. But actually, the reality is that we have a lot of people both in CFC and outside who want to know, why do you do this? Why do you have women pastors, elders, preachers, teachers? They just don't understand that. We really want to... And by the way, we do not set up our position over anybody else's. I understand where people get to, and I understand where certain traditions have gone. I understand that. It's not where we go. But I'll still sit down at a table with anybody who disagrees, still have a coffee with anybody who disagrees. But we just want to say, this is how we get to where we are. I think it's important that at this point we recognize that this is not about lifting women over men. This is merely to recognize the equality given to both in God's kingdom, in his church, and how he calls us to lead. We believe God continues through the Old Testament and into the church, and for the body of Christ to go in strength when both male and female operate in the gift things that he's given them. I would love to take some time, if you would stand with me if you're able at this moment, just to move into some ministry around this. Just to create some space, if we could just call the band back, that would be fantastic. And also just, if we can call our prayer ministry team forward as well, that would be great. We want to create a space just for some women to receive some prayer, who feel that their gifting or their voice has been silenced, or that they have actually been dismissed or set aside in some ministry or church setting. Or also for women in this space, who know that God has given them a gift, and they actually want that fanned into flame, they want to start to move into what God has given them and gifted them to. But they'd love somebody just to stand alongside them and pray for them, pray with them, prophesy and declare truth over them. So we want to create a space for that as well. Yeah, so as the prayer ministry come, I'm going to ask you guys to come straight away for me. But I also think it's important to note that there are some men in this room who have gifting they're not operating and they have either, and that is a stewardship issue also. And if you feel like as a man in this space, you're just saying to God again, God, here is what I have, just show me how to use that for your glory and for your honor, I'd love you to come and receive some prayer too. I also sensed as I was praying for you this morning, that the Lord wanted us specifically to pray for the space between. The enemy is always trying to get in the space between. And where there are males and females operating in spaces together, the enemy is always going to try and get in the space between and pollute the space between. And so maybe if you're in the room this morning, maybe you're a married couple, and you just like to pray that God blesses the space between you. Maybe you are working in a scenario in your business or your workplace where you work with, you're a woman working with men or a man working with women, and you just want that space to be a space of honor, where you can see the value in one another. Maybe you want to come and pray for that. Or maybe there's a strain in a relationship. I feel like the Lord would like to minister into some of those spaces and places today. So we're going to sing. We're going to worship. And I'm going to ask you to be super brave. And if your heart's racing a wee bit right now, and you're like, oh, I need to make the walk. Like come and make the walk. We've all been in this prayer line before. Come and make the walk. And come and receive some ministry. Let's pray. I'm going to pray over you just as we do that. Lord, I just thank you for all the beautiful men and women standing in this room. I thank you that you have chosen them, that you have called them, that you have appointed them, that they would go and bear much fruit. I thank you. You've got plans and purposes for them. And as a body today, we say once more, here we are, Lord, wholly available. Here we are, Lord, wholly available. We pray in this season of our church community that you would begin to fan and to flame that which you've placed within us, that we would not neglect what we have been given, but we would steward together faithfully and harmoniously what you have gifted to your body and your bride so that we might flourish and so that the world might know that you are worthy of all honor and glory and power, that Jesus Christ, you are seated in the highest place. We pray, Father, that in these moments, as we pray over one another and with one another, that your spirit would move, would undo heavy burdens, would lift loads, would heal wounds, would strengthen partnerships and relationships, that your bride might glow and that the world might know who you are.  Amen.
