Happy New Year. It's brilliant to be with you on this New Year's Eve. Great to join with you at Hollywood and in Ariste. I know you guys are watching this morning and fantastic everyone else who's watching online. Happy New Year and let's get stuck into our thought as we leave this year and go into 2024. One of the things that we love as a family over Christmas is the routine of picking a Christmas Eve movie. Now for a few times over the last number of years it's either been Home Alone or Home Alone 2. Never Home Alone 3 because let's be honest like that should never have been made as a movie. But one of the best moments in both movies is when Kate McAllister, the mum of Kevin, has the realisation that they've left Kevin behind. In their rush to get to the airport in the first one or to get to their flight to go to France in the second one, they have this moment where they leave without their son. They assume that he's been counted, they assume that he's with them but then they realise that he's not and what follows is epic Christmas, timeless movie fun. Well in Luke chapter 2 that we're going to read this morning we have this amazing, very human, very real, very relatable story of something similar that happens to Mary and to Joseph and to their son Jesus. Jesus doesn't get left at home alone but he does get left in Jerusalem alone, in the temple alone and so let's read together from Luke chapter 2 verse 41 to 50. His parents, obviously Mary and Joseph, went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of Passover. When he was 12 years old they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast. When they'd finished the days, as they returned, the boy Jesus lingered behind in Jerusalem and Joseph and his mother did not know him. But supposing him to have been in their company, they went the day's journey and sought him among their relatives and acquaintances. So when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem seeking him and so it was on the third day they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions and all who heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers. So when they saw him they were amazed and they said to him, son why have you done this to us? Look your father and I have sought you anxiously. And Jesus said to them, why did you seek me? Did you not know that I must be about my father's business? But they did not understand the statement which he spoke to them. As we look at this passage I want us to ask this question which will guide us hopefully into this idea throughout this whole of the year to come. Where is Jesus going to be found in this new year? Where will people who are looking for him find him? We're going to go through the passage now step by step and we're going to do it in three sections, in the temple, is the temple and we're the temple. But I want us to have that question always in the back of our minds. Where is Jesus going to be found in this new year? Let's go through the passage and we're going to start with this idea of in the temple. Some context is key here as we set the scene and we enter into this fascinating part of scripture. This was the holidays, this was happy times and the festival, the feast of the Passover. We discover that the family were going as they did every year and like the Macalester's on their holidays, on the feast they were heading away. They were going to up to Jerusalem and unlike the Macalester's Jesus actually makes it to the holiday, makes it to the feast, makes it to the celebration. It's important to note that this was tradition. This was part of their rhythm as a family, part of their rhythm as Jewish people, as sincere committed followers of their faith. It shouldn't surprise us actually as we reflect back on the Advent season and the Christmas season that we've come through that we know that this was a couple whose faith mattered to them. They were a devout couple and a sincere couple and so we see this as continuing on in their family life as well. This was their rhythm. I really want to encourage you that your rhythms matter, that your practices, your spiritual rhythms really really matter. Especially parents, not just what is being taught to your children but also what is being caught by your children. Regularity and rhythm matter. I think this is important to draw this out that every year Joseph and Mary went here. Devotion to their faith matters. It provides stability, it provides reference points, it provides rhythm. So I really want to encourage you in this year to come to get your practices set, that your rhythms matter and showing up matters, regularly showing up matters. It's a witness, it's a declaration, it says so much and so much more than maybe you even think or imagine. Not just for parents but for all of us, for all of you, your practices matter, your rhythms matter. I think this is a key aspect actually of what Mary and Joseph are doing here. So showing up in your connect matters, showing up in your community matters, your spiritual rhythms matter and they do make a difference. Just a wee story about how that actually plays out. Friends who I was marrying recently came to Safe Street Hall a few months back and part of the deal that I would marry them was they had to come to church right. There was a really good crowd out that morning, all ages and stages were there and it's interesting as I talked to them after the service what was their reflection, what was their takeaway. They said they loved the interactions between generations, that was something quite special. They loved the worship music, they even thought the speaker was okay too. The guy even said this, he said I wouldn't call myself a Christian but even I was challenged about how I'm living. I believe that him and his wife-to-be found Jesus there in the gathering of his people. A guy walked in off the street after Googling churches in the area at CFC East recently, come into a pre-service prayer meeting where prayer was happening for the very thing that he had been looking for and he gave his life to Jesus. Remember the question that I asked at the start and to keep in our minds, where is Jesus to be found this year? Jesus is to be found in the gathering of his people and we'll unpack that just in a little bit at the end. So back to the text, Mary and Joseph showed up as we learn here and we read in verse 41 and 42 as was their custom every year. This particular feast was the Feast of Passover which we learned all about in our Exodus series. We find out that Jesus was 12 years old, very significant age. He would have been coming into that aspect of manhood. He was about to receive his phylacteries. These would have been the leather boxes that would have had the Hebrew scriptures attached to them. He would have worn them on his head, on his arm during prayers and this was a recognition that he was becoming a man. Verse 33 and verse 45 then tells us the Kate McAllister moment. So Jesus is there, he's at the temple, they're heading home but then they realize that Jesus is not with them. They have kept the Passover, they've celebrated all the things, they're heading home. They've assumed that he was with their acquaintances and relatives, another word is kinfolk. They would have been part of the sort of family community. They would have traveled for safety more than anything in numbers from the Passover back down to Bethlehem but they've discovered that Jesus isn't there. So they've gone a day, they go a day back, traveling perhaps on a donkey. When have they traveled on a donkey? Together before, uncertain about their son. That's an interesting thing we thought as well to think about but anyway. And then we have this key verse in verse 46 and so that they've been gone a day, they've come back a day and then on the third day they find Jesus. Well that's interesting isn't it? Imagine Jesus being found on the third day. Hold that thought and then add to it this one, that he was about his father's business. He was doing what the father had sent him to do, asked him to do. He was about it, he was on it and it was on the third day he was found and seen was in the temple. Hold all those thoughts and we'll come back to them. In the divinity of this moment, the profound significance of this moment that we're going to unpack in a wee minute, there's also the pure humanity of the parents, Mary and Joseph. Not characters in nativity plays but real life parents who have lost their son. They trek back to Jerusalem on the third day, they find him in the temple, they are amazed. The word in the Greek is ekplesu. It actually has this sense of panic, of like reaching out in panic and shock and amazement. There's all sorts of emotions as you could identify with if you've ever lost somebody that really matters to you. And they really struggle at this moment as well to understand what's going on. We get a sense here that Jesus does know what's going on. He's quite articulate in his response to them and I'm not going to get into how and when Jesus knew his full godness. I think that's in the realm of speculative theology and I'm fine with the mystery of the incarnation. But I don't think we want to miss the humanity of this situation. As it says in verse 50, Jesus and Joseph and Mary just didn't understand what was going on. So we don't want to lose the humanity of this but let's think about the divinity of this. As we sit on this side of that conversation, let's go back to the thought that we were holding. Jesus was found on the third day in the temple doing his father's business, being sent and doing what his father told him to do. You see, Jesus would return to the temple in Luke's gospel a few chapters later in chapter 19. And as we move from thinking about Jesus being in the temple, we discover actually that Jesus is the temple. He would go there and he would clear it out. He would clean it out. He would be annoyed at the injustice and the corruption of what was going on there, what was taking place here. Because remember the temple was to be the place where heaven and earth met and where God dwelt. And so in John's account of the same event, we read that Jesus revealed something huge and radical about the temple. We discover that no longer is Jesus just found in the temple but actually Jesus is the temple. He is the place where heaven and earth meet. He is the place where God dwells in fullness. He is where God is to be found. And he clears the temple and in John's account he says this, destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up. The Jewish leaders he was speaking to were totally confused. They couldn't understand it and they were like, but it's taken 46 years to build this temple and you'll do it in three days. But Jesus was speaking of the temple of his body and in verse 22 of John 2, John tells us that when Jesus had been raised from the dead, these sayings came back to their mind and they remembered and believed what Jesus had said. You see the movement of the story from Luke 2, from 12 year old boy Jesus being in the temple, found there on the third day and being committed to his father's business would move to this story of Jesus being the temple, being found on the third day, having completed his father's business. Defeating sin and death and restoring humanity to relationship with God. Jesus would go from being found on the third day in the temple about his father's business to being the temple, being found on the third day, having completed his father's business. What a beautiful point there Luke gives us as he records this chapter and he records this story in his gospel. And remember the question we asked at the start, where is Jesus to be found in this coming year? We know that Mary and Jesus, Mary and Joseph, sorry, found him in the temple. We know that he is the temple, the place where God and humanity met. But we also know this truth that scripture reveals to us in this inspirational, challenging, rallying revelation that Paul makes in 1 Corinthians 6.19. Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have received from God? Because you're not your own, you were bought at a price. You see the reality of the story moves from Jesus being in the temple, Jesus to being the temple, he is the temple, to now we are the temple. You and I as followers of Jesus, of those who have the Holy Spirit in us, one just like Jesus, who Jesus refers to as the alos paracletos, one just like me, who lives within us, are temples where Jesus is to be found. And we, like him, are to be about our Father's business, being and bringing his kingdom on this earth. We live in an anxious world, in an uncertain world, that perhaps you could say, like Mary and Joseph, is anxiously looking for something. I believe that they're anxiously looking for the one thing that Jesus can bring them, salvation, restoration, an answer to the questions that this world has and needs, a solution to the sin problem that this world is struggling with. Where is Jesus to be found this year? He's to be found in you, he's to be found in me, he's to be found as we gather together as church, he's to be found in our temples where he has chosen to dwell, and we too are to be about our Father's business. Jesus was in the temple on the third day, committed to his Father's business. He would become the temple, was found on the third day, resurrected, having completed his Father's business. And now the movement is now within us, Jesus in us, the hope of the world in us, and we too must be about our Father's business. Let's keep that at the forefront of our minds, CFC, as we head into 24, and I want to just close our time together with this prayer. So would you pray with me? In our homes and our families, may you be found there in us, Lord Jesus. In our workplaces, may you be found there in us, Lord Jesus. In our relationships with those we meet and people who we interact with, may you be found there in us, Lord Jesus. In our going out and our coming in, from the rising to the setting sun, in all of our ways, may you be found there in us, Lord Jesus. For your kingdom and for your glory. Amen.
