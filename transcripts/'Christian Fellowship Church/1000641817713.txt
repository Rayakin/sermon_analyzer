Thank you, thank you for that welcome. Great to be back in CFC. Actually, somebody asked me yesterday, literally yesterday, said, how long are you going to do this for? In other words, you're getting so old, why would anybody want you? And I said, well, I said, the common day when nobody will want me and I won't want to do it. And hopefully it all happens in the same weekend. So that's where we're at. After a wonderful week of prayer and fasting, which has been absolutely incredible. My mind goes back to numerous ones that we had over the years where God really spoke to us and spoke to individuals where we both corporately and personally, God really dealt with us and met with us. So we're so thankful for that. What I want to do today is talk about generosity. This morning, you probably noticed all the songs have been about the goodness of God and the whole idea of giving and generosity is a perfect response to God's generosity and God's goodness in our life. And I want to make it clear before I do it that Charlotte actually didn't ask me to speak on this today. She begged me. I don't want to do this. I'm not in the business of condemning people today. Okay. So I won't be doing that. Maybe a wee bit, but not overly. Okay. I just want to encourage you and answer a couple of questions. Recently, we did an offering at Christmas, which to my mind is over 100,000. Am I right in saying that? Which was a considerable amount of money actually on a single offering. And that was incredible. And I began to think about how that generosity is rooted in the heart of this church. When I retired a number of years ago, we were sort of doing a series of goodbyes and we got a group of people together who were with us when we bought this building. And when we bought this building, there were about 80 people. That was it. And then 25 years later, there were still about 55 around, which was really encouraging actually. And I calculated that, but that 55 and 75, 80 had given between one and 2 million pounds over those 25 years. So there's a well of generosity in this church. And I think it's important to say, well done. And the reason it's important to speak about it is because money and possessions are likely to be the major competitor with Jesus for the Lordship and affection in our lives. Lordship of Christ and the affection of him in our lives. It's the one thing that seems to dominate the, our society is the pursuit of things. Jesus makes it really clear in both Matthew 6 and in Luke 16, no one could serve two masters. He'd either hate the one and love the other. He'd be devoted to the one and despise the other. He says, you can't serve God and money. And it's really important that we grasp a hold of that because money affects a very large part of our lives. And the New Testament, let me read you to what Richard Foster said. When the Bible refers to money as power, it doesn't mean something vague or impersonal, nor does it mean power in the sense of purchasing power. According to Jesus and the writers of the New Testament, behind money are very real spiritual forces that energize it and give it a law of its own. Hence money is an active agent. It is a law unto its own and is capable of inspiring devotion. And so we've got to find what the antidote to mammon is, and it's generosity. It's the perfect antidote to the pursuit of money is giving it away. And so what I'm going to do today is to give you seven reasons why over the years we as a church and why I personally have been a giving church. Number one, now it's pretty shallow. I like myself better when I give. Jesus said it's more blessed to give than to receive, and the root of blessed is happy. There's something incredible about meeting someone else's need and giving money away. We've got a verse up behind us, Proverbs 11. The world of the generous gets larger and larger. The world of the stingy gets smaller and smaller. The one who blesses others is abundantly blessed. Those who help others are helped. Isn't that incredible? Let me read it again. The world of the generous gets larger and larger. The world of the stingy gets smaller and smaller. There's something that happens in you when you're generous. There's a well-being that comes to your soul. It's a principle in life. Show me someone who's generous. I'll show you someone who generally is a happy person. Show me someone who's mean, who's stingy, and you'll see someone who is miserable. There's something powerful about doing this. Now, this isn't simply about giving money into your local church. I'll come to that. But this is about developing a lifestyle of generosity. You do it by the small things. You have to consciously think about it and train yourself to be generous. That's one challenge I do have. Be a generous people, not just in special offerings, but in everyday things. There's ways that you can do it. Let me give you a couple of examples. Do you know when you go down to Dublin and there's a toll booth? All right, well, drive up to it. Drive up to it and pay for the car behind you. Just say, I'm paying for my friend here. Paying for my friend. And then drive through the barrier and then wait. And you see this conversation going on. No, you're a friend. Pay. No. No, no, you're a friend. Pay. And they go like this here. And then you wave to them and drive off as fast as you can. And you feel really good all day. Seriously, you feel really good all day. There's something about buying somebody a coffee, paying for somebody's meal. You train yourself to do it. And what happens is something begins, something within you changes. There's something very powerful. A couple of years ago, I got a call from, you know, one of those marketing calls. Hello, sir, this is Help the Aged. And they said, would you like to donate four pounds a month for three years and gift date it towards the work that we're doing? Now, normally, I just say no and I hang up on them. But I thought, I'm going to need them pretty soon, actually. So I thought, this is enlightened self-interest. And so I said, look, I'll tell you what I'll do. How much is that? She said, it's about 150 pounds over three years. I said, look, I'll just give you the whole 150 now. And she said, I don't know if I can do that or not. I said, oh, no, I think you'll find that you can, actually. And so I gave her my credit card details. And then 10 minutes later, I got a call back from a manager because the manager thought that the girl who'd called me was forcing an old person to give money. And I tell you that because it's so unusual for people to be randomly generous. But if you want to feel good in your own heart and your own life, be generous. Be generous. Every time you do it, you remind yourself that God is good and God is faithful. And your generosity is a response to the generosity of God. There's something very powerful about it. If you never get past that one, honestly, it will change your life. Number two, and it's only slightly less superficial, it benefits me. In Scripture, when you, you know, could I get a working definition of prosperity here? Somebody said to me, are you a faith church? And I said, well, I don't know about that, but I don't want to be an unbelief church either. You know, I want to sort of keep a balance here. But could we put that God is blessing you to be a blessing? Could we put another one on it? That God, you've got enough to meet your own needs and something left over to meet the needs of someone else. Could we define it as that and keep it at, understand what I'm talking about today? But there's something very powerful about giving money that actually touches something that will ultimately come back as a blessing to you. Now, this is not simply, you know, the more you give, the more you get. I don't mean it like that. Although if God can trust you with little, he'll entrust you with much. Okay, so that's really important. Let's read Luke chapter 16. Jesus told his disciples, there was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions. So he called them in and asked them, what is this I hear about you? Give an account of your management because you cannot be my manager any longer. The manager said to himself, what shall I do now? My manager is taking away my job. I'm not strong enough to dig and I'm ashamed to beg. I know what it'll do, that when I lose my job here, people will welcome me into their houses. So he called in each one of his master's debtors and he asked the first, how much do you owe my master? 900 gallons of olive oil, he replied. The manager told him, take your bill, sit down quickly, make it 450. Then he said to the second, how much do you owe? A thousand bushels of wheat, he replied. He told him, take your bill and make it 800. The master commended the dishonest manager because he'd acted shrewdly. For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light. I tell you, this is Jesus speaking, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourself, so when it is gone, you'll be welcomed into eternal dwellings. Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much. Whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much. So if you've not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches? And if you've not been trustworthy with someone else's property, who will give you property of your own? No one can serve two masters, either you will hate the one and love the other, or you'll be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money. It's an interesting passage because it appears that Jesus in his teaching is commending someone who was dishonest. It appears that, but of course that's not true. Let me sort of illustrate you what this actually means. Of course, it's a man who's a steward in an estate. He's been fiddling the books, he's caught on, and before he gets put out of his job, he settles, he gives a discount to the people who owe his own boss money. And he does that because he wants them to provide, so they will owe him something whenever he is put out of the job. If I could give you an illustration that might sort of help us to understand this. You probably know Charlotte's a great Harry Styles fan. Not really, it's not well known, that one, but Drew said it's a big picture above their bed that sort of gave it away. And Harry Styles, for those of you who don't know who Harry Styles is, anybody? Yeah, everybody knows who Harry is. Some people have said I look like him, actually, but that's beside the point. Harry Styles is giving his last concert and it's about £500 for a ticket to get in, and Charlotte and Drew, they save up £1,000 and they go, we're going to go and see Harry, last concert, okay. I'd pay money to go and see his last concert. And so they come in on a Sunday and somebody says, Charlotte, could I have a word with you? I just had an urgent note in here for some money for Bibles for the refugee camps in Syria. And we're up to a certain amount, but we need another £1,000. So it's Harry Styles, Bibles for Syria. And so Drew and Charlotte go, well, we're going to forgo that pleasure of Harry and we're going to give the money in. The money goes, you never hear another thing about it. The Bibles, as far as you know, are bought, they're sent over and you never hear a thing. The day comes, and hopefully it'll be a long time away when you die. Okay. Stay with me here. I'm just telling a story. Okay. And what you find is this. So you go, and this isn't how it happens, but I'm telling a story. So you get to, so Charlotte gets up, Charlotte gets to heaven and the gate's open. And there's a crowd of people there. And they're applauding. They say, Charlotte, do you remember you gave £1,000 for Bibles? Well, we got those Bibles. And you know something? We got saved. We gave our lives to Christ. Because of what you did, we'll be your friends for all eternity. That's what that means. You invest your money wisely in this earth. Why? Because it will benefit you. As Jesus said, you will make friends in eternity. I thought somebody was going to shout out, Harry Styles was there, but that'd be too much to hope for. But you get the point. The point is this, that when you invest in God, you're going to make friends for all eternity. But you get the point. The point is this, that when you invest in God's work, it never returns void. It always comes back to you. And you see for us, it may be only £50 or £100. But for someone, it's the means of their salvation. And you get this incredible sense of God enabling us and giving us the pleasure of using our finance to invest in people's lives. Because when the day comes, there'll be a group of people in heaven who will go, thank you for what you did. It benefits us. Number three, it benefits others. It gets better here. It benefits others. 2 Corinthians 9, 12 says you supply the needs of God's people. And it's important that we understand this, that when God supplies our need, he generally uses people. We say the Lord did it. Well, that's fine. But somebody wrote the check. You know, it generally, there are no money trays. It comes through people. God gives the money to you to use it to touch other people's lives. So it benefits other people. And Philippians 4 says, 419, and my God will meet all of your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus. And this is real important. It reminds us that however the money comes, God is the source of our supply. In other words, you may be a teacher, you may work in a health service, you may work in a shop, whatever. God's the source of your supply. He uses other people to get it to you. You may work for it. You may get a gift, whatever. But God uses, God is the person who is the chief of your supply. It's the way that he does it. And it reminds you that when you get money, that your heart expands, not just for the person who's given to you, but for God who gave it to you. And God uses you to touch the lives of other people. And I think it's important because it's the way that he does it. He defines, Paul defines the wealth, the reason for having money is to be able to meet the needs of others. And I think it is the foundation for life of giving, of selfless devotion. It's an expression of our love for God. Somebody actually recently in a church I was speaking at said, God doesn't want your money, he wants your heart. The two are not mutually exclusive. God has your heart, he'll have your money. It's really important. And so there's something very powerful about giving. Whenever I was a brother-in-boy and we used to go preaching with my father-in-law, I remember going to Porto Vogue and every time we would preach, this man I drove, he would cram three pounds into my hand. That was a lot of money in the old days. And I never took it. I always refused it, you know, I thought, I don't need money. And my father-in-law spotted it one day and he said, did he offer you money? And I said, yeah. He said, well, always, if somebody offers you money, always take it. So if you offer me money today, I will be taking it, okay? I want to make that clear. But he said, I said, why? He said, well, here's the point. He said, first of all, God has spoken to him. Let him obey God. Number two, don't deny him a blessing. Because it's more blessed to give than to receive. He's getting a blessing out of this here. And number three, if you don't need it, pass it on to somebody else. So it developed a principle in my life that when somebody offered me money, I did take it and made a decision about it. I remember, I remember had a real crisis because many, many years ago, I'm talking, you know, 30 years ago, we had someone who had special needs in our church. And I've taught this for years. And this girl came up to me and said, the Lord told me to give you some money. And I said, I cannot take that money. You can just see it. Belfast Telegraph, you know, pastor takes money from. And she gave me an envelope and she got really cross with me and said, no, you need to take this here. And it was 600 pounds cash. It was the most humbling experience. Now, personally, we didn't need it at that time. And we were able to give it away. But it taught me again that God can use anybody. God's a source of supply. But when God offers you money, you take it and you say, I'm not going to deny them a blessing. I'm not going to deny them the opportunity to be obedient. I'm going to give it to them. God is a source of your supply. One more little story. When Priscilla was expecting one of our daughters many years ago, I was in my own business. And at one of those times, you ran out of money. And those days, the bank manager called your house and said, don't write any more checks, no credit cards. And he had done that, actually. And I came home and Priscilla said, I fancy some liver for tea. True story. I had 60p in my pocket. And I drove around to the butchers. And I said to Stephen, I knew him, carried off. And he said, I said, Stephen, liver for one. And he handed me a little packet. He said, that'll be 60p. And he goes, tell you what, it's on the house. And God taught me a lesson that day, that God can use anybody to supply your need. God can use anybody to supply your need. But here's the point. God can use you to supply other people's needs. Always be open and listen to the Holy Spirit. Is there something someone need? Because you might say, well, I don't know if they have a need. But if God speaks to you about it, give them the money. You will never know. But God uses you to be his supply, deliverer. He's the source, but he gives you that opportunity. Number four, I do it. I'm going to come to tithing now, okay? They say that if you speak on giving, people get uneasy. If you speak on tithing, they get hostile. Okay? So bear with me. Jesus tells me to, let me read to you what the Lord said, Jesus himself in Matthew 23, 23. Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites. You give a tenth of your spices, mint, dill, and cumin, but you've neglected the more important matters of the law, justice, mercy, and faithfulness. Here's what he says. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former. So Jesus endorses tithing. Okay? Now, it's not either but both here. And there's something very powerful about this. Now, for those of you who don't, have never heard of tithing, it simply means that you take a tenth of your income and you give it to the church. No wild cheering there or anything like that. That's what it is. Now, I'm going to talk a little bit about this here. It's interesting. It's first mentioned in Genesis, okay? Law of the first mention, where Abraham meets a man called Melchizedek. We're not sure who Melchizedek is. Some people think he's a Gentile king. Some people think he's actually Christ himself. There's arguments for both. And Abraham gives a tenth of his possessions to him and establishes a pattern, and they talk about it, that the lesser gives to the greater. And that's developed in the book of Hebrews. It was institutionalized under the law, where everybody in Israel had to do this, were supposed to do it. History shows us that they rarely did it, actually. Only in times of revival. They really never did it. And it's interesting. I've listened to all the arguments about it. And I suppose what I discovered is this. There was never any punishment associated with it. So God doesn't kill you if you don't tithe, okay? Do you know how I know that? Because some of you are breathing and alive today, okay? You're all here. Oh, that was cruel, wasn't it? That was bad. That was really bad. But there was blessing associated with it if you did, okay? So no punishment if you didn't, but blessing if you did. Now, I suspect, and please, I'm not going to make this a law, that in the New Testament, they continued that practice. It was their practice. Eldership was their practice. They continued that practice. And I suppose today for me, if under the law it was mandatory, why, for us who are under grace, why would we give any less? Why would we give any less? So there's something very powerful there. And I don't want to be haphazard in my giving. I don't want to take the change out of my pocket. I want to actually honor God with it. And I give it to him off the top, and I work it out. For me and for Priscilla, we've done this all of our married life, almost 50 years now. And it's a minimum starting point. In the Church of Ireland, whenever they are taking the offering, they say we're collecting the tithes and receiving the offering. Two different words. Collect means that you give it because it's due. It's an interesting one. The Anglican Church do it as well. And then they receive the offering because that is above and beyond your tithe. Let me say a couple of things about this. I think there's four reasons why people don't give and don't tithe, okay? And there's simply this. Number one, ignorance. In other words, they don't know. Well, you do now, okay? Number two, financial. You can't afford to. The reality is, I mean, if you've got a, some people say, well, you can't afford not to tithe. Please get that out of your head. If you are on a very tight budget, if you're in 100,000 a year, it's much easier to tithe than if you're on 20,000 a year, okay? And if it's children's shoes, new shoes for school or tithing to the church, then please buy the shoes, okay? Some people genuinely don't have the money. It's as simple as that. But here's what I would say is this. I think most people want to do it. And because they can't tithe, it's a bit, it's a bit like saying, I can't get an hour a day to spend with Jesus, so I won't spend any time with him. What I would say is this, could you start somewhere? Could, you know, could you do a fiver a week? Could you say, cut out a couple of coffees and make a start, and you'll see what God will do, actually. What you find is this, that, that the, the, you know, that, that bit that's a little bit of a gap begins to stretch, and you find, wow, and you know what? You get a blessing out of it. The, the, the, the third issue is, is relational. And what I mean by that, well, when you give, you wonder how your money's going to be spent. And so fundamentally, if you give your money to the church, other people get spending it. That's the reality. And you've got to trust those people. And if there's a, if you don't, there's a relational issue, and we need to get it sorted out. And number four, very simply, there's a spiritual issue. There's something going on in your heart, something going on with you that prevents you from doing it. And if that's the issue, that needs to be dealt with as well. Here's what I, here's what I believe, okay? And you can take it or leave it. Can you get them up there? Next one. Number one, everyone who's working should tithe to your local church. Okay? It was used for the Levites, because they didn't, they didn't have any inheritance, and they needed, they needed it. Everyone who's working should give to your local church. Number two, those who don't work or haven't got a job should give what they can, because God looks at what you hold back, not at what you give, okay? That's, that's important. Number three, most of us need to give far more than 10%. It's a good starting point. Number four, we should update our giving in light of pay rises. You see, if you, you see, if you give by standing order, you know, 20, if you started 20 years ago, you probably got the odd rise in between there. So update it in light of your pay rises. Number five, maximize your giving by using gift aid. And you say, but I'm married to someone who's not a Christian. Well, you know something? Well, then honor your husband or your wife, okay? Don't worry about it. Don't, if you can't do it, that's okay. But I think there's certain issues there. Number five, I do it and we do it because we believe in the vision of the church. I believe in what God's doing here. Helping, you know, helping fulfill what God has called us to. When I think about our mission statement in CFC, we're a Christ-centered community dedicated to impacting Belfast, Ireland and the nations, the love of God and the power of the Holy Spirit. And that's our vision statement that we've had that for years. You know how it's really good. You know why? Because I wrote it. It's true. And it's really important that you get this. Honestly, I mean, I, you know, it's hard, it's hard often for folks who are employed by the church to talk about this. I'm not. So I can't talk about it. But it's really important that if you believe, if you really believe our vision is here and you want to be part of it, you want to be, invest yourself in it, then you will give to it. If you want to see the reality of that coming to pass, then what you're going to find is that you're going to give to it. If you want to be a shareholder, you give to it. It can't be done without money. And I believe that the people who lead and serve here are people of integrity and their desire is to help us fulfill that mission. And so when you, when you get this, to this point, you trust them. And here's the point, you know, when people say, well, I'm a, I'm a big supporter of the church. People say to me, you know, they support Manchester United. And I said, would you just send them money every month? You're only a fan then. A lot of fans in the church. For the rest of your life, you will give your life to something. You will invest your time, your money, and your effort into something. The only question is, will it be worthy? And if you don't get or believe in the vision of this church, please find a vision that you do believe in and give yourself to it and give your money to it. Because when you do that, you invest in the kingdom of God. We've been givers for all these years, because I really believe in what we're doing here. Number six, and I'm nearly finished. I want to set an example. When we were, we were old school, we gave our kids pocket money. Anybody still do that sort of thing? And then we, but what we did was you give them the money. Let's say it was a pound. I then took 10p back, said that's no you're tithing. That's trained them. And we wanted to set an example. Something very powerful about that because parents, if you don't set an example to your kids and they don't know that you give and you tithe to the church and to the kingdom of God, it sets an example to them. For our girls, it's interesting. And you know, they're not all walking with the Lord. But I remember one of them said to me, she got a big pay rise and she said, dad, who will I give my tithe to? I said, well, make it out to me if you like. I'll send it. I'll make sure it's you. But you know, there's something that you invest in your kids. I've always been inspired by a man called John Lang. John Lang was a civil engineer, born at the turn of the 20th century, Christian. And he and his wife got married. They decided that for the rest of their life, they would live on a third of the salary, whatever they earned, and give away two thirds. And for the rest of his life, they did that. And they set something in motion. Now, he didn't know at that time he would become a billionaire. Lang Construction was the biggest construction company in Western Europe at one time. And the Lang Trust to this day is the biggest Christian trust that a century, 125 years almost after his birth, that trust gives away more money into God's work than any other Christian trust in the UK. Why? Because somebody in their early 20s decided, I'm going to be a giver and I'm going to be generous. Wouldn't it be incredible if some of you decided that as well? I don't want to, you know, be prescriptive about the actual, but did you said, you know something, I am going to pour, I'm going to give money to the kingdom of God. I'm going to invest in the kingdom of God. If you start when you're young, it'll become a habit. It'll become something that you do. And you will find that in years to come, both spiritually when you arrive in glory, and actually on this earth, your money will do far more than you ever thought it would. But we did it because we wanted to say that was one of the reasons we wanted to set an example. And finally, and last, number seven, I did it that someday I would hear the commendation of Christ himself, well done, good and faithful service, servant. There's a, in first Corinthians three, it talks about the, it's called the Bema, it's a judgment seat. And it's, it's a, it's not judgment for sins, but judgment for works. And all of us will have our service for God evaluated. I think it'll be private, but I will be the biggest job review that we've ever had. And we'll be asked what we did with And we'll be asked what we did with her time, her talents, her gifts, and her money. What did you do with it? And honestly, I want to hear those words, well done, good and faithful servant. And that's why we're a generous people.
