Let's go to John chapter 15, verse one through 11. I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that bears fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit. You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you. Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, neither can you unless you abide in me. I am the vine, and you are the branches. He who abides in me and I in him bears much fruit, for without me you can do nothing. If anyone does not abide in me, he is cast out as a branch and is withered, and they gather them and throw them into the fire, and they are burned. If you abide in me and my words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you. By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit, and so you will be my disciples. As the Father loved me, I also have loved you. Abide in my love. If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love. These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be full. It's brilliant to be with you and to start off this new year together. Welcome to all those online and those as well in Caf√© Church. When I was 19, I took a gap year and went to work in a school in South Africa. There's a picture of the place I went to work at on the screen. It's a place called Parle in the Western Cape, and the school's set in the middle of a valley. It's just surrounded by vineyards. At that stage, I didn't drink wine. Not that I drink a lot of it now, shall I say, but at that stage, I didn't drink wine. It didn't really mean an awful lot to me there, but it was really quite a stunning location. Vines everywhere, but when you look at the picture, you'll see that those vines are attached to what are called trellises or guides that help them grow, and these are everywhere as well. So for the vines to grow, they have to have the right support structure. There's something within a vine that wants to grow. It knows that it has to grow. There's something actually in its makeup that wants to grow, but for it to grow and for it to reach its full production potential of fruit, it has to be guided in a certain way for it to maximize its production. For it to be fruitful, it has to be guided in the way that it should grow and in the way that it should go. Vines are natural growers and they're climbers. There's almost like this ascendancy. There's something within them that wants to ascend, that wants to grow, but they have to be guided in the way for them to achieve everything that they are meant to achieve. And I want to suggest to us as we begin this new year that we are no different. We as God's creation are no different. We too are natural growers. We know that there's something and there's someone that we need to ascend to. We know that there's a way to go. There's been a lot of talking already this morning about walking, isn't there? Walking in the way of Jesus. We know that there's a way to walk in this world. Everyone's searching for a way to walk in this world. We believe we have found the way to walk in this world. There's something within us that knows that there's something for us to walk towards, a way for us to be, a way for us to live. But I want to suggest that we need support around us in order to get that right and in order to walk in the right way. Today I want to spend some time thinking about having a rule of life for the year ahead. It's exciting, isn't it? They, as I walked in this morning, said, Are you talking about disciplines this morning? I was like, yes. We love starting the new year with discipline, don't we? Something that Ryan and Priscilla and Charlotte touched on in their Connect resource video. If you haven't seen it, go to our website and have a look at it there. But something that they touched on back in September. I want to unpack a little bit more, go into a little bit deeper as it is a church family, about what we mean when we talk about a rule of life. Is it strict? Is it all about discipline? Is it about this like harsh regime? Is it a regime? Are we starting a regime? No, none of that. But it is about intentional and directional discipleship. A rule of life is about staying connected, remaining close, and remaining rooted to the source. To be like the one who is blessed in Psalm 1 that we read, who is planted beside streams of living water. As Priscilla shared in her prophetic word, about walking beside Jesus, about knowing his footsteps beside you, about being close, that he is saying, this is the way, walk ye in it. And so we follow him. Is that what we do as followers of Christ, isn't it? As Christ owns, we follow him. And so to follow him, he is walking in a way. And to remain close to that way, the way of Jesus, a rule of life is a super helpful structure around which directs us how to go. Like Jesus calls us to in John chapter 15, a rule of life helps us abide in him. And the amazing thing about abiding in him is that he then abides in us. His words abide in us. His love remains in us. His joy remains in us. And our joy may be full. A rule of life is not something to be dreaded. A rule of life will help you be joyful. Isn't that amazing? Who wants to be joyful? Amen. This is where we are fruitful, when we abide in him and remain in him. And that is where we are joyful. So what is a rule of life? A rule of life is a commitment to live your life a certain way. As we who say we are followers of Jesus, we commit to walking the way that he walks. John 15, Jesus uses this language of remaining in the vine. There is connection here, closeness here, rooting here. Vines draw from the source, branches draw from the source of the vine. And so that intimate connection with Jesus is how he is calling us to live, not just this year, but in our lives as his followers. A rule of life is about commitment to live your life a certain way, regardless of the way that culture lives its life, regardless of the way that society lives its life. The current cultures of society around us move quickly. They can be flowing in a direction. I was walking yesterday. Can I just say as well, just kudos to CFC East, right? So I was jogging. Yes, I was jogging. I was jogging. Lamb was running. There's a difference. Along the Greenway on Friday, and I met some CFC East members, very fit and healthy members they were too, on their bikes, out for cycles. I'll not mention names, but you know who you are. The current of culture, and as I was jogging along, I was thinking about my surroundings. And then on Saturday, I was walking again down, I did a lot of exercise this weekend, I was walking down the towpath at Shaw's Bridge, and the current was moving really, really quickly. And I just felt the Lord saying, it's like that in life, isn't it? Culture moves so fast. You think even now, what has gone on as opposed to what's five years ago, 10 years ago, 15 years ago, how quickly things have moved. Language even now that we have that we wouldn't even know what the words meant five years ago. So the things move really, really, really, really quickly. And the rule of life is a commitment to live in a certain way, and it's not about always fighting against culture. It's not always about fighting against it, like we're in some sort of culture war, we've always got to be fighting, and always got to be resisting, and always got to be driving against and swimming against the tide. Sometimes can I say this, culture is actually moving in a way that's quite healthy. There's some good things that are going on in culture. It's not all negative, it's not all bad. As I watched the stream flow at Shaw's Bridge yesterday, there was moments actually of stillness in particular pockets of the river, where there was no massive flow, it was just gentle and it was fine. So I don't want us to get this idea that we're always got, because I tell you what, swimming against the tide is ultimately exhausting, and I tell you who's going to win, because is it about winning? It's about following Jesus, and at times do you need to go against culture, absolutely. Are there times you need to resist, absolutely. What I feel the Lord is calling us to, is let's just be aware of what is going on. I drove down from Monterey this morning, as I sat at the Cassaray traffic lights, there was this huge mist just covering Belfast, a dark, heavy mist. But see when I drove down into it, it would be very easy to be unaware that it was even there, because my perspective had totally shifted. What I could see from one position, when I was in it, I couldn't actually see it. Sometimes that's the danger of being submerged in culture, you're not even aware of what's going on. The Lord would call us to be aware of what's going on, and aware of what to fight back against, aware of what to resist, and awareness of what is going on in the cultural climate around us, because currents can be strong and can be powerful. They can be invasive, and an incessancy around the bombarding of our minds at this moment. It can be very difficult to live a way that is counter to that culture, but I do believe God is calling us to believe the way of Jesus is a way that is different. A rule of life we can see all the way back even as early as Daniel, in his formation. A rule of life is about a formation, it's about being shaped and formed in a particular way, in a way that will honor God. And what Daniel decided to do with his diet, with his prayer rhythm, all of that was about a formation that he would live in a certain way that is different to those around him. But I want to say this as well, did he work in that culture that he was in? Yes. Did he have a position in the culture that he was in? Yes. He was fully in the culture that he was in, but he lived in a different way within it. And so a rule of life we can trace back even as early as Daniel. A rule of life is also about intention. It's about making choices that become habits. Holy habits that help shape us and form us in the image and likeness of Jesus. The way of Jesus is a way to make good choices and good habits. Just like Jesus did, Luke 2.52 we read this, that he grew in favor with God and man. The word in the Greek is prokopto, to cut forward, to intentionally advance. He makes decisions in his life at this stage as a young man to go forward in a certain direction. He cuts forward, he prokoptos, he makes a way, and that is the way then that we follow. He is intentional about what he does. There is direction and formation in the choices that Jesus makes. It doesn't tell us many things about Jesus, but I believe we see that worked out in his life. We see his prayer rhythms. We see his times when he sits around the table with people. We see him walking. He walks a lot. We see him climbing mountains. We see him going to the sea. We see the rhythms of Christ. We see the way of Christ. We see the love that he has for people. We see the time that he spends with people. We see his rhythms. We see his habits. We see the fruit of those years of choosing to intentionally walk in a certain direction. Habits are hard to break. We often say that about bad habits, don't we? Bad habits are hard to break, too. It takes time to form them, but when they're formed, they shape us in a really good direction. And so rule of life fundamentally helps us become like Jesus. Because if Jesus isn't shaping us, something is. Rule of life, Gabriel, you might say this, it's not even in the Bible. And you're right. It's not. Rule of life is not, you'll not find it in Scripture. But you'll not find the Trinity in Scripture either, in terms of the word. But you find the concept. You find the ways. You find the language. You find the outworkings of it. It's there. And so we just give it this word to help us understand it better. So rule of life officially began as a concept in the 6th century. It's largely attributed to a guy called Saint Benedict. And he set up a monastic order, a way of living. Now, I'm not calling us to monks, right? I'm not calling us to go and find a monastery and start. But what I do think is the idea of the monastic, a modern monastic way of living, living in a way that is not like the rest of the world. That was ingrained deeply into the early church, ingrained deeply into the way of Jesus. And we are called to live in that way. And we see that as early as Acts 2. We see this early church that had holy habits. They had a way of living that was markedly different to those around them. We see in Acts 2.42 that the early church continued steadfastly. It's really interesting when you look at that word because that's pro-scartario, pro-kepto. Like Jesus did, the same root verb being used here, to be intentional in the direction that you're going. These guys were intentionally or steadfastly or devoting themselves to a way of living and a way of being. And so we see the early church had this holy habit, this rule of life established as well. But what were they doing? Well, they were selling their possessions and goods. They were continuing daily to eat together, to break bread. They had gladness and simplicity in their heart. They met and broke bread together and prayed together and had fellowship together. They had their habits. This was the way that they lived. This was the rule of life. This is how they did life. And so this deep, deep well of spirituality that we get to draw on, we mustn't lose sight of it in our modern Western world. The word itself, rule, comes from the Greek word trellis. I think we'll see a picture of this on the screen now. I think this is really helpful for D in particular because it's not a strict tightrope D. It's not a tightrope. God is not saying, Jesus is not saying, my way is a tightrope for you to walk on. And you've got to be careful because you can easily fall off. I was taught that as a teenager growing up. It's a narrow road. It's a broad road that leads to destruction. It's a narrow road. I was terrified. When am I going to fall off? Have I fallen off? Have I backslid? Have I fallen backwards? There were so many pitfalls, wasn't there? It was like I was tiptoeing through my Christianity. That's why I think this isn't like a bad thing. This is a freedom. And we're going to sing a song to close today with where it talks about that. It's only in his will that we are free. A trellis is a guide and it's actually there to help us grow in the way of Jesus. It is a structure that allows the vine to move and to find its way. And that's why my rule of life or the way that I'm going to follow Jesus isn't going to directly look like yours, young man. It's not going to look the same. It's definitely not going to look like yours, D, you know. But we will have different rules because vines will grow on a trellis. But it is a boundary and it is a way of growing and it does give direction and it will help us become everything that God has called us to be. It is a framework. It is a guide that helps us to grow. Rule in Latin is regula, which is this gentle guide that helps us be kept training our eyes on God. Climbing vines and branches, guys, can never reach their potential unless they have a trellis for support. Because we want to grow, don't we? But things can grow a bit all over the place. So for us to reach our potential, a trellis is really, really helpful to guide us as we go. One thing that's been really, really helpful for me, and I want to say this, like when I started getting into this about 2018, it's made the biggest impact in my Christian life for a very, very long time. Having a rule of life. I find it so, so helpful, and that might just be me personality-wise, but I find it so, so helpful for me to be intentional and directional in how I want to follow Jesus. And one of the ways, and I've used this picture back in Hollywood when we planted that and got it up and running down there, was this picture of a latte. You always need a flake in that, don't you? And that's not because I was in the coffee shops in Hollywood all the time, okay? Just want to say. But this idea of a latte lifestyle. Now I don't mean that you go for coffee all the time or, you know, I'm not talking about that sort of lifestyle. It's great, and there's lots of great options in the Belmont Road as well. What I mean is by this, it's a segmented life where we have our spiritual, and then we have my work, and then I have my family, and then I have the other things that I do in my life. It's like we segment our lives into areas and sections, and I felt what the Lord would want us to do is to stick a spoon into that, mix it up, because actually it's about all of our lives. There is no secular and spiritual. There's no divide. There's our life, and Jesus wants us to give our life to Him and to walk in His way. And so what does that look like? What does it mean then to have a rule of life? What does it mean to have a life that is committed to following Jesus, to have a trellis around your life to give you direction and to help you and to support you and guide you in the way of Jesus? What does it look like to realize that there's no divide between my work and my church life, that all is for Him, that my family life is for Him, that my relationships with my boyfriend, girlfriend, husband, wife is for Him, that my parent is for Him, the way I live my life as a single person is for Him, the way that I live my life as a retired person is for Him. My life is committed to Him. My way, I want to be His way. Where He walks, I want to walk. It's the holistic approach of our life and our being. And so I believe the Lord doesn't call us the latte lives, not that there's anything wrong with lattes, or cappuccinos, or indeed flat whites. I still haven't quite worked out what a flat white is. If you can tell me, it just looks like a small cappuccino to me, but maybe you can tell me differently. Slow burn that one. We want to get a little bit practical here, because I don't want to just cast out this idea. And hopefully you've seen biblically like a rule of life is a Daniel thing. It's a Jesus thing. It's an early church thing. It's a Benedictine thing. It's a deep well of spirituality and Christian history and tradition that we draw on. And I'd never heard of it before, largely I think sometimes in reformed Protestant charismatic, whatever you want to call it, upbringing, didn't really, I mean St. Benedict, you dare mention St. Benedict. So much is a rich, beautiful history that we have in our deep wells of Christian spirituality to draw from. And we would be negligent to overlook it. And so what we've tried to do is to help a little bit. So if you look at our website, you'll see this. It's not a section. We don't have a section on the website for this. Because I actually really, really want to focus on this this year. And is it like glitz and glam and all? No. But it's really, really formational and deeply helpful for your spiritual walk. Tried to put it into a table and give you a bit of a guide. Please, you do not have to fill in every box. So for all you like box fillers, I want to have this and I want to have that and I want to do this. But what this is a way, it's a way fundamentally of auditing where we are in our spiritual walk. It's about looking at the life of Jesus. It's about looking at the habits that are encouraged in the way of Jesus and going, what is in my life? What's not in my life and it should be in my life? Where do I want to grow? What part of the trails do I want to develop in and grow in? How can I be best supported and helped? And it's one of the most helpful things that I've done in my Christian life because it helped me grow on purpose. I don't know about you, but does it not just feel like life just happens sometimes around you? It just happens. Like Christmas, I mean, Christmas literally came and went. It's like, what just happened? And for me, if I don't intentionally do something, I won't. If I don't, I won't. And so for me, it's really been helpful. But I want to try to put it into some categories and help us as we journey through. And I'm going to share a little bit just about what's on mine and how that works out. So like rest, how are you resting at the minute? How is your Sabbath? Do you keep a Sabbath? Does Sabbath enter into your mindset? I would suggest that it should. Really important spiritual concept. How are you being refreshed? If the Lord rests and refreshes on the Sabbath, how are we doing that today? As Jesus was resting and refreshing on the Sabbath with his friends and hanging out and doing things, even doing things, by the way, that he shouldn't have done. But as he was eating and pulling corns and having a walk with his friends, as he was doing these things on Sabbath, helping people on the Sabbath, as he was doing these things in his rhythm, so too we, who will follow the way of Jesus, want to walk in his way. So how are we doing that? What does that look like for you? For me, I can't take a Sabbath on a Sunday because Sunday is my only day of the week that I work, okay? So I have to... And I'm only saying because you're all thinking here all the time, like all my mates who aren't in church all think it's a gig, like they really do. They're like, I get when you're tired, I get on you when you work one day a week. All that sort of stuff, right? Which isn't true, can I just say. But also, I can't have a Sabbath because if I took a Sabbath on a Sunday, then it wouldn't work any day of the week, do you know what I mean? So it starts on a Friday night. It is a bit Jewish of me, and that's fine. Starts on a Friday night. How does it start? Starts generally with music. I love music. And I'll put on music, and I'll cook my favourite meal. Well, it's Leanne's favourite meal, and I'll say it's mine, but hopefully she's not watching. I'll cook her favourite meal, and it begins with a meal together. That's important. It begins with a prayer. It begins with being aware. I'm entering into rest and refreshment. That's really important. Awareness. It means that the emails do not get checked, and the phone does go away, because I want to be refreshed. That's what it looks like for me to enter into Sabbath. It looks like then spending time with the children, really, really committing to them and their activities on a Saturday. I don't find that stressful. I find it a joy to be with the children on a Saturday morning and do everything that they need me to do, and be where they need me to be, and pick them up when they need to pick up, and then have a really, really good coffee with Leanne with a really nice treat and a bun, and for those who work on staff know that that's a big thing for me, because I don't have that many treats with sugar in them, so I have it then. It's a delight. Sabbath's a day of delight. It's a day of saying, this is the day the Lord has made, and I'm going to rejoice and be glad in it, that every good and perfect gift in my life comes from him. I'm going to enjoy the good and the perfect gifts in my life, like family and good coffee, good food. I'm going to enjoy those things. I'm going to delight in what the Lord has given. There's worship in there, and there's Scripture in there, and there's all the things that you would expect to be in a Sabbath, but it's a really, really delightful day. What does it look like for your body? Well, for CSE East members, the four that I met over the weekend, they're already on this. They're like, yes, my rule of life considers looking after my body. It's really, really important to look after our bodies. That's not separate to our spirituality. Indeed, it's part of it. Well, why? We've just come through an incarnational moment, haven't we? How did Jesus come to humanity? In a body, didn't he? It's really important. The first thing that we are given to steward in Genesis is our bodies. How do we look after our body? Jesus did so much walking. He's up mountains. He's by the seas. He's doing all these things. We have a responsibility to steward what God has given us, so how are we looking after our body? We knew, and we knew, the science tells us, it's only catching up with the kingdom now, that a healthy body is a healthy mind, and it helps us. It's not separate from our spirituality, but it's at one with our spirituality. So how are we doing it? What does your routine look like? What does your rhythm look like with your body? How do you look after your body? What are you giving your attention and your devotion to? And what a great opportunity in this week ahead to take an audit of our lives, to take some time to go, well, how many hours, literally, am I spending on streaming devices, on Netflix, on Amazon, on Apple TV, or whatever it is? How many hours am I spending on my phone scrolling? And Apple has this really good thing that'll give you your screen time every Monday. No? You just don't know, because you're all so holy. You don't have those things, and other mobile phone devices are available, of course. Look at your screen time, and ask yourself. It's an awareness piece. It's an awareness. What am I giving my attention to? What am I devoting myself to? And so you start to then have a guide, and go, well, if I give that amount of time not to that, but I give it to something else that will be more beneficial in my spiritual life, we start to grow, and our trellis starts to support us, and the more we do something, the easier it becomes, because habits are hard to break, even good ones. What does it look like in our workplaces? What does it look like with people? Who are we spending time with? Who are we committing to? Jesus did a lot of stuff with people. Part of his rule of life was spending time with people. How are we doing that? How's that working out for us? Again, it's an audit. It's looking at our lives, and I'm like, guys, we've got to be intentional. Otherwise, life just comes and goes and passes us by. Let's take a little bit of intention and direction with our spiritual walk, and a rule of life really is helpful to do that. What does it look like with our mission? What does it look like for generosity? Paul's going to speak on that next week, and by the way, wow, 112,000 pounds in Compassion Appeal. That's amazing, honestly. The amount of good that will be done through that is fantastic, but what is our generosity looking like? A couple of things before we move to a close this morning. Can I say that it's really important to acknowledge this? Everyone actually currently has a rule of life. You just need to be aware of what it is, so don't think that this is, oh, I could never do this. You actually already have one, but what I'm asking is, is it the way of Jesus? Is the trellis helping you grow and shape and become more like Jesus? So you already have one. I think there's an important bit about acknowledging it. The next thing is when you start to make changes to it, start small. Start small. What can you do to make a difference? Just make it small. My small change even this last term was setting my alarm for 6.33. Why 6.33? It's a bit weird, isn't it? Well, Matthew 6.33, 6.33 says, seek ye first the kingdom of God. So when my alarm goes off, 6.33, seek first the kingdom of God. I'm getting up around that time anyway, so why not 6.33? It's amazing. It's really, really small, isn't it? And you might think, well, that's rubbish. You're perfectly entitled to your opinion on that. It's actually really, really helpful. It's really, really helpful. We're creatures of habits, and it's a really, really good habit that when I see that 6.33, automatically in my mind, today's about his kingdom first. And everything else will come into line with that. What are the areas you want to grow in? Next thing as well is start small. Also tell somebody about it. I'd love us to be a church where this language of rule of life is common. We've got a common language. How's your rule of life going? Have you done it yet? Because you know what helps? Accountability. It's an old-fashioned word, isn't it? But it's really, really helpful. Accountability is really, really helpful. That's not to put pressure on anybody, but it's just like to encourage. Have you started it? Well, no, haven't. Well, yeah, I've actually done this, and actually, this has made a difference. Oh, really? I could do that too. Accountability helps. So if you're going to have a conversation with me over the next wee while, watch out. I'm probably going to ask you how your rule of life is. If you put your head down and walk fast in the opposite direction, I know what's going on, okay? Start small, start manageable. Could you do this in your connect group? Absolutely. Could it be a conversation in your twos and your threes? Could it be those people that you journey closer with, your Peter, your James, your John, those in a closer circle with you? Can you help each other grow? Can you help each other put them from frameworks in place? I think so. We're much more likely to follow through on things when we're doing it together. A little bit like that old game. Do you remember we used to play it like school sports days when they get the parents out of the crowd, maybe, and they put you in the planks, and you've got, like, strings to hold onto your plank, and you've got to, like, complete the course? Am I the only one who's ever done that? Do you know what I'm talking about? Yeah, and then you get someone who goes, left, right, okay, let's go, and you stay in your rhythm. It's much easier to be in rhythm whenever other people are with you. It's a really good spiritual practice to have community around you who are tracking in the same direction as you are. And lastly, it's a really good opportunity, as you see in the table there, to write it down. See things that are written down and, like, put somewhere that you can see. That sounds really simple. But actually, practically, it's really, really helpful. It just is a visual reminder. It's there, it's present, and it helps us as part of our discipleship journey. Is it everything? No. Is it something? Yes. This will not, you know, transform you from not like Jesus to Jesus in a day, right? That's not what it's about, right? But it is about, as Priscilla brought the word, and I think it's important and significant, as Dee brought the word as well, it's about walking. And Jesus only ever asks us to follow him, and he walked. And this is about walking with Jesus, the author and the perfecter of our faith, the one who begins a good work in us and will see it to completion, and he invites us to walk with him. And this is just a way, a way of helping us to do that. This week that we move into now, this week of consecration, yes, it's the same theme as September because I just personally don't feel anything's changed from then to here. I think it's so important to have this idea of consecrating, and setting apart, and making time, and putting things into place for holiness. This is a great opportunity again this week to decide to follow Jesus. Prayer and fasting is part of our rule of life at CFC as our church community, and it has been for decades. It's what we do every September and every January. It's already in there. You can fill that section already in, right? You can fill that box. That's what we do. Why? Because Jesus said, when you pray and when you fast, Jesus sets his expectation for us out a long, long time ago because he knows that habits shape and form us. And so he calls us to be a people to pray and to fast. In this week ahead, it presents us a brilliant opportunity to stop, to pause, to audit, to look, to ask the Holy Spirit, to reveal to us, to show us, to help us put things into place. Where do we need to grow? What do we need around us that will help me become more like the one that I love, who loves me, and that calls me to follow him? Would you stand with me as the band come back, please, if you're able? We're going to sing and close with the song, Jesus, All for Jesus, which is a song obviously very dear to us here at CFC and a very significant and important song, prophetically written a long time ago and still resonating with so many across the world today. But it's the line, I think, that the Lord wants to highlight to us this morning. It's only in your will that I am free. It's only in your will that I am free. Freedom and joy and all the good things that God has for us is available for us as he calls us to walk in his way. And as Jesus walked his way and as Jesus said all those years ago to follow me, so he says the same thing today, to follow him. All we've done this morning is look and think about ways in which we can do that to the best that we can. You close your eyes just as we pray. Jesus, we really just thank you that as we move out of a season where we focus and remember intently on your incarnation, we thank you that we do not have a high priest who cannot empathize with us, but in all ways endure what we endured and knows us. And I thank you for your faith in us, that when you call us you believe that we can follow. I thank you that you walk at a pace that we can walk at. Help us, Lord, this week and protect our time, protect our minds this week, protect our health this week, protect our families this week, protect our homes this week. As we set time aside, as we consecrate, as we commit to fellowship with one another, as we commit to pray, as we commit to fast. Help us to walk in your way. That was the charter course. Knowledgeable and thankful that it was you who began the work in us and you will bring it to completion. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen.
