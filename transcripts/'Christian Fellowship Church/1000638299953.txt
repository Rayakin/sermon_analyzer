Welcome to the CFC podcast. Before we get stuck in, I'd like to take a minute to let you know about our Compassion Appeal. Every year, CFC's Compassion Appeal impacts thousands of lives across Northern Ireland. People struggling with basic needs like putting food on the table, keeping warm and getting school uniforms for their children. The book of James that we've been studying is very clear about our responsibility to outwork our faith in our actions, and the Compassion Appeal is a great way to do that. If you'd like to join us in making a real difference in the lives of those who need it most, head to thisiscfc.com, that's thisiscfc.com, where you can give to this year's appeal and see what a difference your generosity makes. Thank you. We are in the second and final part of our short two-week Advent series before we go into Four Service Sunday next week, which is going to be absolutely epic. The teams have been working really hard. We're very, very excited to see you all and all of your family join with us across the day next week. But this is the second part of our Advent series. Now, the plan was, last week we would look at Mary's song, and this week we would look at Zachariah's song. That was the plan across all of the sites that we were going to do. But then a wee problem arose. I got hijacked in the first couple of verses this week when I sat down to study, and I went down a rabbit hole, and guys, I could not get out. I was literally phoning Gibbo at five on Thursday, going, Gibbo, why am I in Revelation? This is not good. And so I'm going to invite you to embrace the rabbit hole with me, and I'm going to take you on a bit of a journey that I'm going to confess to you this morning. My thoughts are not fully formed, but I discovered some things this week in the story of Zachariah that I have never seen before, and I just cannot stop thinking about it. So I'm going to invite you to be curious with me and to embrace this passage of Scripture as we begin to look at Luke 1 and the story of Zachariah. Now, in case you don't know who Zachariah and Elizabeth are, they're this married couple. They're relatives of Mary, the mother of Jesus, but they're much, much older. Zachariah is a priest. He's in the line of Aaron, so he functions in temple worship. Elizabeth is also in the line of Aaron, his wife. And they're getting on in years. They're much older than Mary, and they have never been able to conceive a child, and that's where we pick the story up. Now, what I want you to do for me as we read this, because many of you have read this passage a gazillion times, I want you to pay attention to all of the details. Try to log as many details as you can as we begin to go through, because I think that those details are perhaps more important than I certainly first realized. So Luke 1, verse 5 says this, in the time of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zachariah who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah. His wife, Elizabeth, was also a descendant of Aaron, and both of them were righteous in the sight of God, observing all the Lord's commands and decrees blamelessly. But they were childless because Elizabeth was not able to conceive, and they were both very old. Once when Zachariah's division was on duty, and he was serving as a priest before God, he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying outside. Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him standing at the right side of the altar of incense. When Zachariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear, as you would be if a big angel turned up to work. But the angel said to him, Do not be afraid, Zachariah, your prayer has been heard. Your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you are to call him John. He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth. For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born. And he'll bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God. He'll go on before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord. Zachariah asked the angel, How can I be sure of this? I'm an old man. My wife's well along in years. Well, Elizabeth wasn't there to hear that. The angel said to him, I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God. I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news, and now you will be silent, not able to speak until the day this happens, because you didn't believe my words, which will come true at their appointed time. Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zachariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple. When he came out, he couldn't speak to them, and they realized he'd seen a vision, for he kept making signs but remained unable to speak. When his time of service was completed, he returned home. After this, his wife became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion. The Lord has done this for me, she said. In these days, he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people. So we will pick up the story again when Zachariah sings a little later, but what's interesting to me is this prophetic revelation that Zachariah gets. A prophetic revelation is a revelation of something we shouldn't know, but then we get to know because God wants us to know it. I was at a conference many years ago now, and I heard a guy say this, and it was like a throwaway comment, but I've never really forgotten it, and I think about it frequently. He said this, prophecy is an invitation to a conversation. Prophecy is an invitation to a conversation. It's not like God just tosses out some facts and then is like, well, there you go, do with it as you will, and walks off. He gives you something in a prophetic utterance because he's inviting you to draw close and talk to him about that thing. Prophecy is a conversation to an invitation, and ever since I heard that man say that, anytime anyone gives me a word, particularly if it's a word that I've had many times, which is often the case with prophecy, I think, well, Lord, you're inviting me again into this conversation, and I ask the Lord, the chief question I ask the Lord is this whenever I get a word. Why are you telling me this? Because, you see, the Lord doesn't tell us everything, so when the Lord does choose to reveal something, it's a really good question to ask, well, why are you telling me this? Why do I need to know this? And obviously with Zachariah, why he needed to know this was because there were some details he needed. When Elizabeth was pregnant, he needed to know that the baby was going to be called John, and he needed to know the things that were going to happen. The why was fairly apparent in Zachariah's case, but another question that I've been asking more recently, and this is the one that tripped me up this week with this passage, is I don't just say to God, why are you telling me this? I then say to God, why are you telling me this now? Why now? Because you could have told it to me years earlier, or in some cases, if it's not something that happens for years more, you could have told it to me later. Why now? Because God is very specific in the details of what he does, and this is the question that tripped me up with Zachariah this week. Why does God reveal this revelation of the fact that he and Elizabeth are going to give birth to this son, and his name's going to be Jonah? Why the way that it happens? Why when it happens and where it happens? And the reason that I find it peculiar here is because of the way revelation tends to come in the pattern of Scripture. You see, God's prophetic utterances, his invading of our natural, normal world, and the things that we can see with our natural, normal sight and hearing happens frequently throughout Scripture. God is always intervening and telling us things that we wouldn't know if he didn't tell us. It's a pattern of Scripture. Here's the thing, though. When God does that throughout the Scriptural narrative, it is nearly always in the middle of very ordinary circumstances. When God reveals himself to Abraham, Abraham's simply sitting at his tent, the entrance of his tent, on an ordinary day. When God reveals himself to Jacob, Jacob's having a nap. It comes in a dream. Very ordinary behavior. When God reveals himself to Moses at the burning bush, Moses is just out looking after his sheep. Very ordinary behavior. You track that right through to the New Testament, and you're going to see the same thing. Mary's revelation comes in the middle of an ordinary day. It's so ordinary, in fact, we're told very little about it. Jacob's revelation of what's going to happen comes in the middle of a nap. The shepherd's revelation comes when they're just looking after their sheep. You see how it's all echoed? It happens in the middle of ordinary things, but Zechariah's different. Because when God chooses to reveal himself in this way to Zechariah and give him this prophecy, it is in the middle of a very extraordinary day that Zechariah's already having. Now, you can be forgiven for thinking when you read this, this is just an ordinary day of work. Because after all, Zechariah's a priest. Where else would he be but in the temple? This is not ordinary guys. Because even though Zechariah's a priest, there are so many priests at the time. There are thousands of people in the line of iron that function in temple worship that scholars estimate that the priests of Zechariah's day would have served approximately two weeks a year in the actual temple. They would have been on duty, and that's why the scriptures tell us he was on duty. That would have happened only two weeks in the year. So the rest of the time, that's not where Zechariah would have been, and it's not where he would have been hanging out. So this was already special. It's already a special time of the year because now he's on duty in the temple, which is a really special place for the priests. But then look what happens next. It says he was on duty, and then he's chosen by lot. You see, you could go your whole life and never be picked to go and make the offering of incense in the altar. That's chosen by lot. And some scholars estimate that that was a one in 18,000 chance of you being picked. And it's a symbol of the favor of God. So Zechariah already is rocking up to work on a pretty special week because he's on duty, and then he's chosen by lot, and everybody's like, Zechariah, can you believe this Zechariah? It is entirely possible that Zechariah has never had this opportunity before, even though he served in the temple courts and as a priest for decades of his life. This is a special day. That's not the normal pattern, that God would show up in the middle of an extraordinary day like that. Usually it's in the middle of the ordinary. The next thing I noticed is this. There's a repetition of a word. And whenever you get repetition in scripture, pay attention, especially what am I always telling you when it's a detail that looks like it doesn't even matter. And there's this repetition where it says, where we're given the context of this revelation where it says this. He was chosen by lot according to the custom of the priesthood to go into the temple of the Lord. Surely that's enough information. He's in the temple. It's all we need to know. Well, apparently not, because then we're told, why is he in there? He's chosen to burn incense. And then the time of the burning of the incense came, and all the assembled worshipers were praying outside. And then an angel of the Lord appeared to him standing at the right side of the altar of incense. There's all this talk about the incense, the sacrifice, the offering of incense and the altar of incense, and where the angel stands near the altar of incense, and it's like, you're not supposed to miss the fact that it's this specific offering that's happening at this time. So you can imagine me sitting, right, studying, saying, I need to get to Zachariah's song. I couldn't get past this. So I'm like, what is this about? What is with all of this drawing our attention, and why is this happening in this holy moment that's already happening for Zachariah in the incense? So whenever you begin to track this offering, this offering, it starts in Exodus 30. Let me read it to you. It says this, and it goes right back to the tabernacle. So in case you don't know, whenever the people come out of slavery, then God wants to be in their midst. And so he gives them really specific directions for how to make this tent, this tabernacle in which he'll dwell, and the things that are supposed to occur in it. And as part of that, it says this in Exodus 30, make an altar of acacia wood for burning incense. It is to be square, a cubit long, a cubit wide, two cubits high, very specific. Its horns of one piece with it, overlay the top and all the sides, and the horns with pure gold. Make a gold molding around it. Make two gold rings for the altar below the molding, two in each of the opposite sides to hold the poles used to carry it. Make the poles out of acacia wood, overlay them with gold, put the altar in front of the curtain that shields the ark of the covenant of the law before the atonement cover that is over the tablets of the covenant law, where I will meet with you. Man must burn fragrant incense on the altar every morning when he tends the lamps, and he must burn the incense again when he lights the lamps at twilight. So incense will burn regularly before the Lord for the generations to come, and it did indeed burn regularly before the Lord for generations to come. And so this is tracked right through from the tabernacle, right into the temple era where it's no longer a tent, but a solid building. This incense goes up morning and night, and right through to this moment. When you look for incense in the Old Testament, you're going to see lots of references to it, to the recipe for the incense, to the offerings of incense, to the altar of incense. You're going to see lots of references. You get to the New Testament, you're going to find very little about incense. Not because it's not still happening, but because the details aren't particularly relevant to the story that's being told. Except all of a sudden in Luke, we're finding all about incense again. The only other places you're going to find this talked about in the whole of the New Testament is one very brief reference in Hebrews. Hebrews is a book about the sacrificial system and how that relates to Jesus, so that makes perfect sense. One brief, one brief reference. And the rest of the references that you're going to find to incense in the New Testament, you're going to find either in Luke 1, where we've just read three references, or the book of Revelation. What is going on here? So then my curious mind, curiosity nearly killed this cat this week, I'm just telling you. My curious mind takes me to Revelation. So I'm carrying, so this is what we need to do in Scripture if we want to dig deep. We've got to carry all of the information, all of the details we know from one passage and carry them with us into the other passage and see if any of this ties together, because sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't. Let me read for you what happens in Revelation 8, which is the key passage around the incense in Revelation. Now, I want you to note that the story I'm about to read you from Revelation is not like Luke 1, because Luke 1 occurs in earth. Revelation 8 occurs in heaven. This is in a glorious realm, and I want you to carry the information you know from Luke with you into Revelation 8 and watch what happens. Revelation 8, verse 1 says this, when he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour, and I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them, and another angel who had a golden censer came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense to offer with the prayers of all God's people on the golden altar in front of the throne. The smoke of the incense together with the prayers of God's people went up before God from the angel's hand. It's a window into a realm that you and I cannot see with our natural eyes, what's happening in glory somewhere. And what you begin to see, if you look very carefully, is a whole heap of links back to what's happening with Zachariah on earth. Because first of all, we see this, that there's angels who stand before God. How does Gabriel introduce himself to Zachariah? In Zachariah doubts, he says in Luke 1, 19, I am Gabriel, and I stand in the presence of God. I'm one of the angels who stand before God. First link. Second, we see this. Another angel, Revelation 8, who had a golden censer came and stood at the altar. What detail were we given in Luke 1? Then an angel of the Lord, Luke 1, 11, appeared to him standing at the right side of the altar. We see the same thing happening. Link three. The angel was given incense to offer. What is Zachariah in the temple on earth doing at that moment? Luke 1, verse 9. He was chosen by lot to go into the temple and burn incense. He was given incense to offer. Link three. Link four. The smoke of the incense together with the prayers of God's people went up before God. So the incense reaches God as do the prayers of the people on earth. What does Gabriel say whenever he comes to earth to speak to Zachariah? Verse 12. Verse 13. Do not be afraid, Zachariah. Your prayer has been heard. It has reached God. Link five. The most bizarre moment in the whole of Revelation is this. There is silence in heaven. There's never silence in heaven because the angels cry out, holy, holy, holy all day long. There's silence in heaven. What do we find happening on earth? I am Gabriel and I say to you, you will be silent and not able to speak. Silence in Zachariah. And all of a sudden, we see this very earthly story, albeit a bit supernatural, but it's happening in the realms of a very ordinary world broken in a million pieces. And we see this image of this thing unfolding in this glorious realm we cannot see. And they are so similar. And what happens in that moment is these two stories go like this. And the writer does something for us. He pulls the realm of heaven right into the space of earth and the two become intricately connected because what we're being told is this. Heaven is closer than you think. Heaven is closer than you think. You see, you could be forgiven for thinking in a world that is full of brokenness, pain, sorrow, and hopelessness. That the glory, the beauty, the wisdom, the wonder, the power of heaven is so far removed from your life. That it's out there somewhere, but it's not down here in this mess. And the story of Christmas, if it does nothing, reminds us heaven is closer than we think. Because heaven has collided with earth. Heaven is with us. Heaven is closer than you think. And so from the very beginning moments when that tabernacle, you heard the details as I told you about one piece of furniture, the altar, you heard all of the details. And when you get to your daily readings and you get to the bit where you have to read all the details about how the tabernacle is made, and then later all the details of how the temple is made, you kind of hope the two pages are going to stick together in your Bible and you'll get away with leaving a chapter out. Because you're like, this is a lot of details, like why do I need to know this? But it's because right from the very beginning, what God wanted to do was take the reality of a glorious realm you could not see and bring it down and put it on earth. Yes, it would be a shadowy kind of diminished, not fully formed version, but it would be a window into the world that you can't see. And that's why the directions were so specific, because it was taking the directions of another realm and laying them on earth so that you and I would have access to the glory and the wonder of a world that we could not see. And then when you get to the temple, the same things happens, all these directions, because what's happening is something of the glorious, hidden, supernatural, heavenly realm is being laid on earth. It has to replicate in some way the wonder of the glory of heaven, because you're being invited into the wonder of the story of heaven. Heaven is not as far away as you think. And then remarkably, Jesus comes and he says, I'm the temple. I'm the place where heaven and earth meet. Heaven is not far away. It's right in front of you. You can touch me and see me and feel me and hear me. Heaven was right there among them. But you know, the most remarkable thing of all is then when we move further into the New Testament, we are told that if you know Jesus, if you are in a relationship with him, you are the temple of the Holy Spirit. Oh, maybe a shadowy diminished, not fully formed version, but the reality is this. Heaven dwells within you. All of the glory and the beauty and the wisdom and the hope and the power of a supernatural realm that seems very, very distant is in fact very, very present because it dwells in you by the power of the Holy Spirit. And what that means is wherever you go, heaven is closer than those people think. So you walk into your work this week and it's falling apart and it's collapsing all around you. But guess what? You've just walked in. Heaven is closer than anyone thought with all of its power and hope and authority and beauty and wisdom because it's carried in you. You entered this Christmas season and the complexities of the Christmas season are not lost and may I understand that for some of you, the Christmas season is immensely difficult and part of that is the fact that you're going to be spending some time in complex family situations. And some of you are kind of praying for a flu because you can still eat turkey with a flu, but you can't go see the relatives with a flu. And we're laughing, but the reality is for some people, it's quite difficult for you to go into the situations you're going to have to face over the Christmas period. And you walk into complexity and you walk into brokenness and you walk into historic all kinds of things that trundle into that space. But guess what? When you walk into the room, heaven walks in with you and all of the power and the wisdom and the authority and the beauty and the glory of heaven is held in your very frame because heaven is closer than you think. And that changes everything. I love that Revelation and Luke go together. It made me very happy this week. What made me even happier was when I realized that Revelation is not the only place that you start to see links between Zachariah's story and these kind of prophetic or apocalyptic scriptures. In case you've never heard the phrase apocalyptic before, in the Bible, each book, I don't know if you know this, but each book has a different literary style. So some are poetry, they should be read like poetry. Some are narrative or history, they're telling us things that happened. Some are prophetic and they're speaking about, they push us forward into the story that's not yet. So the person's writing, but they're not writing about what's happening right now and they're not writing about what happened back here. They're writing about something that hasn't existed yet, so they're prophetic. And some are apocalyptic, Revelation being the chief among them. And what they are is they push us into the future like prophetic texts, but they push us right to the summation of the story. Because God doesn't want you and I thinking that we're going round and round and round some cycle and the story's just going to keep going round and round and round. No, this story's going somewhere. And the apocalyptic texts remind us, no, there was a heaven and an earth created, but there's a new heaven and a new earth coming. And the old is going to pass away and the new is going to come and the heartache is going to give way to hope and the tears are going to give way to joy and the sorrow is going to give way to dancing and the ashes are going to give way to beauty. Like there is a summation to this story and we are hurtling towards it. And so the apocalyptic texts, they push us that way. And also the prophetic texts give us this future orientation that lift us out of our moment and say, no, but there's more coming. Don't forget there's more coming. And what was interesting to me this week as I studied was this. I noticed that Zachariah, the links that I could see, the details of the text in Luke with Zachariah's story were linked to Revelation, this chief apocalyptic text, which pushes us to the summation of the story. But actually, whenever I saw other links, they were also in either prophetic texts or apocalyptic texts, future oriented texts. There are other similarities that push us forward. Let me show you just a couple. Remember that funny detail of the story where Zachariah asks for a sign and then he's told he'll be silent. Yeah. And what actually happens is God gives him a word. He tells him a prophecy, something that's going to happen. And then he's silenced. And then he says to Zachariah, you will be silent, but not forever. You'll be silent until the thing comes to pass, until the joy and delight, that's the phrase used of John. He will be a joy and delight until the joy and delight of John comes. And when he comes, your mouth will be opened and you'll be able to speak again. So whenever the prophecy becomes a reality, that's when you'll be able to speak. So it's really interesting. That's unusual in the biblical text, but it's not the only time that happens. Did you know there's another time where this happens? It happens in Ezekiel. Let me read you what happens then. So Ezekiel is prophesying and the Lord has given him a prophecy. And interestingly, the prophecy is this, and you son of man, this is Ezekiel 24, 25, and you son of man, that's him speaking to Ezekiel, on the day I take away their stronghold, their joy, their glory, and their delight. Isn't that interesting? So Ezekiel has been given a word about how the joy and delight of the nation is going to be taken away. And then this is what happens after he's given the word, and their sons and daughters as well. On that day, a fugitive will come to tell you the news that it's happened, that the word I've given you has come to pass, and at that time, your mouth will be opened and you will speak with him and you will no longer be silent. So you will be assigned to them and they will know that I am the Lord. And then in Ezekiel 33, that happens in the 12th year of exile, this all happens, the city has fallen, and now the evening before the man arrived, the hand of the Lord was on me and he opened my mouth before the man came to me in the morning. So my mouth was opened and I was no longer silent. Do you not find that fascinating? That Ezekiel is given a word about the joy and delight of a nation falling, then he's silenced and he's told that whenever the reality comes to pass, his mouth will be opened again. That's exactly what happens. And then Zechariah is given a word about how the joy and delight is going to come and he's silenced and told when he gets to the other side, his mouth is going to be opened again. I find that interesting in the middle of a prophetic text that we're seeing links back to Zechariah. Let me give you one more and then I'll explain why this is important. Remember that in Zechariah, in the story of Zechariah, what's the name of the angel that comes to see him? Gabriel. Sometimes angels show up and they don't say who they are, but Gabriel announces that he's Gabriel. And then he comes to Zechariah and he makes a statement, your prayer has been heard. That's not the only time you're going to see Gabriel in the Bible. You're going to see Gabriel a few other times in scripture. Let me show you one. This one is found in Daniel. Now Daniel is both a prophetic and an apocalyptic text. So Daniel talks about things that are happening in his day, but there are also elements to Daniel that push you forward into the future and to the summation of all things. And in the middle of another apocalyptic, prophetic kind of a text, look what happens. Daniel 9 verse 21, while I was in prayer, this is Daniel speaking, Gabriel, the man I had seen in the earlier vision came to me in swift flight about the time of the evening sacrifice. And he instructed me and he said to me, Daniel, I have now come to give you insight and understanding. As soon as you began to pray, a word went out. So Gabriel comes to Daniel and he starts by saying, your prayer was heard. Isn't that interesting? I find it fascinating that somehow there is something in this story of Zechariah that keeps pushing us to prophetic and apocalyptic texts, keeps diverting us to all of these places, to all the parts of the story that push us to the future that is yet to be. I find it so interesting because I think what we're hearing is this, heaven is closer than we think and the story is bigger than we realize. I think it's very easy when you read a story like Zechariah to get stuck in Zechariah's one moment. And I think what the text wants us to remember that this moment is significant because it is connected to a much bigger story that's hurtling in a direction into the future of the summation of all things. And so interestingly when Zechariah does begin to sing, his song, his statement, the things that he says when John the Baptist is born is all future oriented. Let me read it to you. Verse 67 of Luke 1, his father Zechariah was filled with the spirit and prophesied, praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has come to his people and redeemed them and he has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David. So he's talking about the birth of Jesus which is yet to be. As he said through his prophets long ago, salvation from our enemies, from the hand of all who hate us to show mercy to our ancestors, remember his holy covenant, the oath he swore our father Abraham to rescue us from the hand of our enemies, to enable us to serve him without fear and holiness and righteousness before him all our days. And you my child, so this is just a baby, will be called a prophet of the most high. You will go before the Lord to prepare the way for him to give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins because of the tender mercy of our God by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven to shine on those living in darkness in the shadow of death and guide our feet into a path of peace. Something in Zachariah can't help not just to pick up this beautiful baby into glory in the moment but something happens where he can't help but shift his gaze to the future because he has awakened to the reality that his life is part of a story that is much bigger than he is. This story is much bigger than a miracle baby being born. It is ginormous. The story is so much bigger than we realize. And what's interesting to me is you watch how Zachariah, the way that the Bible refers to Zachariah before John's birth and after John's birth. Before John's birth, it'll be Zachariah, Zachariah, Zachariah. In fact, Zachariah is kind of the protagonist, the main character of Luke 1 apart from the moment where Mary and Elizabeth take center stage. But apart from that, on either side of that, Zachariah is the main character. He's chief dog, you know? And while there is no doubt shame around Zachariah and Elizabeth because of the way that their culture viewed childlessness, that shame would have mostly sat on Elizabeth, not Zachariah. Zachariah was quite revered in his culture because he was a priest, that made him revered in the culture because he was old and older people were revered in the culture. But then the story arc takes that man who's already revered and he goes on this like giant climb because then he's on duty and he's chosen by lot. And everybody sees that he's been chosen by lot. So now not only is he an older priest, but he's an older priest that God has chosen. And so he's going up, up, up into the center of the story. Then when he's in the temple, he gets an angelic visitation that takes him up even further. And then him and his wife give birth to a miracle baby that takes him up even further. Zachariah is like the center of this story. He's the protagonist, the main actor, the main character. And then John the Baptist is born and watch how the language changes every single time that Zachariah is referred to after John the Baptist's birth is in this format. Verse 59 of Luke 1, they were going to name him after his father, Zachariah. Verse 62, they made signs to his father, that's Zachariah. Verse 67, his father, Zachariah, was filled with the Holy Spirit. Work with me here. Before John's birth, Zachariah is Zachariah and he's the main story. The moment John is born, he becomes John the Baptist's father. He becomes John the Baptist's father and he's never referred to again outside of that relationship. Remember he's the main character, but you see, this is what's happening. Zachariah takes his moment as assigned by God. He takes his moment and he carries out his assignment well. And then John the Baptist comes and the old begins to pass away and the new begins to come forward because this story is going somewhere. It is hurtling into the future. And so the old begins to pass away and the new begins to emerge and he's no longer Zachariah. He's now John the Baptist's father. And the reality is John the Baptist will then take center stage for a time. He will be the miracle child who grew up with the hand of God clearly upon him and the crowds will gather and gather and gather. But then Jesus will show up on the banks of the river and John the Baptist will say, I must decrease and he must increase because the old is passing away because now the new has come. Because this story is going somewhere. And all of that to say, it is absolutely essential to your discipleship and mine that we understand that we are part of a story that is much bigger than us. That we are part of it, but we are only part of it. And that the significance of our lives is in that it relates to the bigger story of what is unfolding. Now if you and I don't catch that, there are two things, two traps we can fall into. If we don't understand that we are part of a very big story either, we will think that our life is utterly insignificant. Oh sure, I can walk down the street and no one knows me. Nobody cares whether I show up or I don't. My life is utterly insignificant, is it? Is it? Are you not part of a glorious, divine story that has you born for such a time as this? Because you see, you can choose a lot of things in your life, but you are not supposed to choose your birth, the time you come into the world and the time you leave it. You're not supposed to choose those things. They're in God's hands because you see, God is thinking about your life, but he's thinking about your life in connection to all of the other lives and the big story that's unfolding. You have a part to play, that's why you're alive. You are literally in the middle of your part right now. And if you don't understand that you are part of this big story, you will waste your life on reckless living because you think it doesn't matter what you do with your life. Nonsense. You can fall into the trap of thinking you're insignificant, or if you don't realize you're part of a bigger story, the other side of the hill that you can fall off is thinking that you're everything. The whole story revolves around me. My life. And listen, you're giggling, but we're all guilty of it, getting up and, do they not know what I have to do today? Like the whole story revolves around me. You know, my life, what I want to do, what I want to achieve, my dreams, my ambitions, my ideas, my calling, my mandate, mine, mine, mine. Mine, yes, but ultimately his, because it's part of a large story that's unfolding. And we have to know that we are part of a big story or we're going to fall off one side or the other of this cliff. The reality is you and I have two jobs to do, two jobs to do concurrently. Let me place this in physical parenting for a minute. So if you're a parent, listen up for a second. As a parent, I have two things to do. I have to fully live out my mandate as Charlotte Curran, born on the date she was born, departing on the date she will depart. Between those two dates, it is my absolute responsibility to be faithful to the mandate that God has in my life. Ephesians 2.10 says that every single one of you has good works ordained in advance for you to do. It is your job to do them. It is my job to carry out the mandate of being Charlotte Curran while I am alive as faithfully as I possibly can. One job. My other job is to be the mother of Cain and Eli and to make sure that while I carry out my mandate, I also help to unfold theirs. I unfold them and release them into the call that God has in their life and I prompt them forward into faithfulness. As a parent, you're responsible for both of those things at the same time. And if you forget one or the other, you're going to be in trouble. You're responsible for both of those things at the same time. And oftentimes there comes trouble in parenting when a parent wants to overlay their mandate on their children and create their children to be what they want their children to be. We do not have authority to do that. We simply get to unfold what God has created already. That's our task. My task is to do both those things at the same time. And if I'm so busy off here being Charlotte Curran that I forget to unfold Cain and Eli Curran, I am missing my mandate. Or if I'm so busy thinking about my kids that I forget that God has also called me to do some distinctive things that are mine, I'm going to end up in a world of trouble. We have to carry both at the same time. But what I want to say to you is whether you're a parent or not is neither here nor there when it comes to this issue because every generation is given the responsibility of unfolding the next generation. One generation tells the next of the glorious deeds of God. I don't care if you're 99 years old. If you're 99 years old and you are here living and breathing, then you're doing both things at the same time. You still have good works to do that are yours and it is also your responsibility to see someone who's younger than you and prompt them and release them and push them out into faithfulness. That is literally your job. Whether you're a parent or not, you've got to find someone younger than you and you've got to release them. If you're 13 years old, it's still your assignment to do what you're called to do, but to find a seven-year-old coming behind you and to make sure that they're being cheered on into everything that God has for them to do. This is how the body of Christ works. It has to work like this. And so I ended up down my rabbit hole this week and I'm not even sure, I'm not even convinced to find a rabbit, but here we're all down the hole together now and the point I want to make is this. See this Christmastime, please allow the Spirit of God to lift your eyes to the reality that heaven is closer than you think, but also to widen your vision and your perspective because you are part of a story and your part matters and this story is going somewhere so we've got to get everybody on board. We've all got to be on board. And if you and I spot someone who's not on board, who's somehow gotten lost somehow, it is our job to go find them and restore them to the story. This is the mandate and this is the story of Christmas and this is what you're called to do. And isn't that so much more exciting than burning the turkey and forgetting that you've done by the ribbons or the sellotape for the presents the night before? Like it's so much better than this. We've made Christmas so rubbish compared to the reality of it. It's so much better. And so the Spirit of God invites you, invites me back into the story of Zachariah and the reality that heaven is so much closer than you think and the story is so much bigger than you realize and you are slap buying in the middle of it today, ready to play your part. Let's pray. I'm going to invite the worship team to come. I'm going to invite you to stand with me as we pray. Thank you for listening. We're going to worship. We're going to lift our eyes to the throne in just a second, but before we do that, I'm going to invite you to just posture yourselves in an act of surrender again today. I'm going to invite you just to open your hands in front of you as an act of, I'm here, God. Lord, I just pray over this room. I pray in the places and spaces where heaven feels very far away, where the hope and the glory and the joy of heaven seems so distant. I pray that by your power and through your people this week, heaven would be pulled down to earth and the two would collide. I pray father that you would re-energize our hope and our ability to see that you're at work where we haven't maybe missed it. Lord, we say today, we don't want to be sleeping in Bethlehem when there's a choir of angels outside on the hillside singing glory, God's here. We don't want to miss your arrival. We don't want to miss your coming in our day and our situation in our lives. So I pray father for us as a community that you would help us to see that heaven is here. And Lord, I do ask that you would enable us to remember that this story is bigger than we realize. Lord, if there are those in this room who have believed the lie that their life is insignificant, I pray that lie would be broken in the name of Jesus. And I pray that people would begin to treat their lives as the precious things that they are. I pray against any work of the enemy that would cease to get a person to sit down or even stop living. We pray against that in the name of Jesus. And we pray where there is the temptation of death, life would flood in. And Lord, we pray for those of us who find ourselves caught up in this wondrous, glorious story that all of the good works ordained for us, that we would be faithful in every single one of them. Lord, I pray that you would help us to live lives that are so in tune with your spirit that we don't miss a thing that you want us to do, an opportunity that you give to us. And Lord, we do ask for the generations in our house, Lord, in our gathered community here, but also the generations represented in our various wide family circles. And we pray, Father, over the generations that one generation would indeed tell the next the glories of God. And we pray, Father, that there would be so much wisdom and wealth and riches, glorious riches passed on that the generation coming behind would run faster and harder and more pure in their thinking and wiser and clearer than we ever were, Lord. We pray that the generations that come from this house would be held safely in the palm of Jesus and that they would unfold into everything that they are called to be. And we pray for those, Lord, who aren't represented here today in the generations. We pray for parents who deeply long that their children were here. Lord, I thank you. You know exactly where those kids are. And we pray that today they would sense your presence. They would know your kindness. They would experience that deep, drawing invitation of the gospel of the kingdom of the good news drawing them back into the fullness of who they are. We pray you would protect them while they wander, that you would hedge them about. And that this Christmas there would be many families who would know the joy of the people they love finding you for the first time or for the first time in a long time, that you would restore the generations because your story is good and you are still creating a new heaven and a new earth and you're still going to wipe away every tear and you're still going to give us beauty for ashes and joy for mourning. You're still writing a good story, Lord. And we leap as a community, we leap into the middle of it again today. We leap into the middle of it again today. Amen.
