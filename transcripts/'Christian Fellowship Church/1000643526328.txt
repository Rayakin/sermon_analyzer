So yes, Charlotte has been talking about all things of the Holy Spirit being wild and honestly, this is wild crack, getting a call at 11, right? Seriously, are you kidding me? And I was like, well, what's today supposed to be about? Because we're in this rhythm of spiritual practices and it was supposed to be about meditation. So you're all coming here this morning, even the worship team, they had to get a quick text because meditation is typically very serious business. And I'm like, well, guys, honestly, in the spirit of meditation, which also means regurgitation, I'm going to regurgitate my sermon from Inner East last week because apparently you kind of didn't even get to the preaching part, which I loved. I was like, if that could happen this week, that would have been cracker, right? Because seriously, God, what are you playing at? But isn't it fun? And do you know what I'm choosing to believe? Because there's something so powerful about this particular discipline of celebration. And I'm choosing to believe that God wants to remind us that we are a community of celebratory people. Some of us need to tell our faces that, right? We are a community that have so much to be thankful for, so much to be grateful for, full of joy and excitement. And if I'm really honest, this for me was one of the weird practices to talk about. And I remember when we're obviously waiting on teaching notes coming through and I'm dead excited. What are we teaching in January? What's happening? And they said spiritual practices. And I feel that we're constantly speaking on that. I feel like I just did that. I'm pretty sure we just did that. And then there was part of it around going, well, actually, this is so foundational, right? What we're trying to communicate, what we're trying to participate in is so foundational as you and I become intimate with the Lord Jesus, right? It just doesn't happen. Yes, God is a God of transformation, but it does involve our active participation. Even what Gary was saying in communion, right? There's this incredible thing that has been provided, but we have to join with it. We have to participate. We have to position ourselves in so many ways. We are where we are recognizing the presence of the Lord. We talked about a few weeks ago, the rule of life. Don't you just love that when someone says here are the rules, right? So I honestly start to shake when I hear rules and discipline. Even though I'm a very disciplined person, I don't particularly like someone telling me that I have to do anything. Anyone else in the room? But here's the thing. You already have something forming you. All of us, right? You can look over your week. You can think about what you've been thinking about. Think about what you've been watching and reading and listening to. All of that stuff is forming you. And if you're anything like me, a good Christian, right, comes to the start of the year. And my prayer every year is like, God, I just want to look more like you this year than I did last year. I want to lean into that truth of Christ being formed in me. And hopefully that looks like character development. Hopefully I'm a little bit more loving, a little bit more patient, a little bit more focusing on the gifts of the spirit. Hopefully that's radiating from me as I go. Literally the journey of my life, I want to make room for Jesus. Habits. Don't we just love good old spiritual habits? I don't know about you, but I don't think about my habits a lot. The bad ones, I mean. I just happen to do them. Anyone else notice that? Your bad habits, you don't have to give thought to them, hence why they're a habit. And so the whole reason we practice spiritual habits is that they would become the thing that we naturally do. That we'll do it without even thinking. And we're trying to discipline our lives so that it becomes second nature. I'm trying to do this thing this year. And honestly, it's really, really difficult because I read my Bible on a Bible reading app, which I'm sure a lot of the room do. But I don't know about you, but I get so distracted, my alarm goes off. And I've even put a tagline on the alarm, because you can do that on an iPhone, going, get up and read your Bible, right? Just to try and motivate me to get out of bed and do it. And so I turn the alarm off. And the temptation to go and check all of the notifications that are on my phone from overnight is really strong. Anyone find themselves, I had great ideas to get up and soak myself in the Word. And here I am on Instagram because something on Facebook pushed me there, right? And I'm going, no, no, no. So my discipline this year has genuinely, I've been trying from the 1st of January to get into scripture before scrolling, right? This simple practice, I want to do scripture before I scroll. And see for me, like, honestly, this week, I feel like it's become, it's getting a habit, right? Something that takes like 63 days to form a habit so that you're not even thinking about it. And this is what I had to do. And it was really difficult to start. I had to turn my alarm off and open the Bible app, then get up and go to the bathroom and come back. I was like, the scripture's right there. It's like it's an invitation. And something is forming us. So what habits are you putting in your life to form you? If you want to become more like Jesus, you're not going to get there by not doing holy things, by thinking about him, by leaning in to the practices that he invites you into. A rule of life, are you making room for him? If you want to be a better person this time next year, what are you doing? What are you giving your life to? What has your attention? Because if we don't lean in to action, our New Year's resolutions lean into just another year, right? Where there's no change. And we make the same one next year. I promise I'll do it next year, Lord. I will. I will. Right? And we find ourselves stuck in a rut. I love Galatians 4.19 when Paul is praying, my children, I'm again suffering labor pains for you until Christ is formed in you. That is the goal, that you and I become more like Jesus. Richard Foster is probably the godfather of this book, right? This idea of practicing discipline. His book became this real class thing around church years and years ago with the celebration of discipline, which is, I hear it, a bit of like, doesn't really go together, right? It's a bit of a class. We're celebrating discipline. Help me with that, right? Two words that shouldn't go together. And he talks about a lot of what you and I would call our spiritual disciplines, things like meditation, prayer, fasting, study, simplicity, solitude, submission, service, and then the corporate disciplines of confession, worship, guidance, and celebration. It's all about us drawing in to God's story, to encounter God, because we are informed and formed in his presence. And all of these practices allow us to get to a place where we're completely transformed if we let them. So here is where I personally would struggle with some of this, because I'm a bit of a religious nut, if I'm honest, right? I do like a bit of discipline. I will do things to the death, right? Just because this is what we do, guys, right? I will faithfully read my Bible every morning. I'll say my prayers. I do all of that. And one of the things that God has been teaching me over the years, right, is like, Jill, the practices aren't just it, right? It's not just about turning up and going, I read my Bible today, boom, great. Aren't I a great Christian? It's not about just practicing them and then moseying along. Like, here's the holy activity, and now I mosey along with my life. The practice in itself, the activity, the task is just a tool to get me into the presence of God. If I just simply go, the tool is I read my Bible, boom, tick, done. And I haven't encountered the presence of God in the middle of it. It's just become a random task that I do. The task, the tool is supposed to push me into this intimate, lively, joy-filled, celebratory relationship with Jesus, right? And there is a beautiful Jewish word. In Hebrew, it's this, it's kavanah, right? And rabbis would literally teach this to anyone who is engaging in holy activity. They actually have this rule and say, if you don't get into a state of kavanah, right? And I'm going to explain what that is. You shouldn't even be doing the activity. Kavanah is this awareness, this idea, right, that God is about to do something, right? Is about to meet with you, is about to become more aware because you become more aware, right? He's there, and quite often we don't even feel him, right? He's constantly present. He never leaves. He never forsakes. He is always present to us. But if we, truth be told, we're not always present to him. And so this idea of kavanah is that we would become really aware of the activity we're engaging in. That I don't just get through my Bible reading plan, but I open it and I'm going, I am about to hear from my daddy God. I am about to hear from my father. I'm about to hear something from the creator himself. He's about to speak to me right now, right? Not here's another day that I get to go, woo-hoo, completed your reading plan. But I get to have a conversation and I settle myself. And I become aware that he's about to speak to me through the pages. I become aware when I pray that I'm not just going down a list praying for everybody that needs prayer. But actually I'm aware that who I speak to right now has the power to completely transform this situation. Who I say words to, it's not just going into space. The words themselves have power, power to change and power to transform. And in so many ways I go, when it comes to these practices, are we aware of what we're doing? Whether it's reading the Bible, whether it is meditation, whether it is sitting on your own and just being quiet. Because quite often we're not hearing God because we just live in this fast paced world where everything is so noisy. And sometimes we're afraid of the silence because we're afraid of what we might hear. And so we just fill it with stuff. Let's position our lives to make room for what the spirit wants to do. And that probably means looking at your calendar, probably means looking at your activity. What are you doing? Where do you want to go? And what are your goals to get there? The most beautiful thing about all of these celebrations and all these disciplines that I've realised is that it's supposed to have celebration threading through it. We're supposed to approach all of these things with joy, right? Now I don't know about you, but solitude doesn't really do it for me, right? I am a people person. So the idea of someone forcing me to go and sit in a room and wait, honestly, I'm like twitching at the thought of that. But yet sometimes it's quite often the very thing that I need to do to hear God speak to me. So it's supposed to be joy. It's supposed to be right. Me and you, Jesus, let's have at it. Let's start to see all of these things that feel uncomfortable as an opportunity to celebrate. Richard Foster put it like this, without joy penetrating all of the disciplines, they'll quickly deteriorate into another set of soul killing legalisms. Without a joyful spirit of festivity, the disciplines become dull, death breathing tools in the hands of modern Pharisees. If we don't understand the art of this discipline, right? This disciplined life that does all this holy activity, because the holy activity is an invitation to intimacy. We'll totally miss the point of the activity itself. This is an audience participation I'm about to tell you, you're going to shout out in a minute. But I want you to think about the word celebration. What comes to your mind? Party? Birthdays? Liverpool? Easy. Easy. Anyone? Anyone else? Man United then, okay. What did you say? Yo, Man United got a yo. So we were celebrating in our house yesterday. So we had three major things happen. The CEAG test result was coming in. Lily was doing her driving test. My car was going for the MOT. To say that I couldn't really prep a new sermon was because I was celebrating. Let's be honest, they were things to be celebrated. Heidi was a biggest smile on her face with her result. Lily passed her test. My little Kia passed the MOT. I was like, this is a day, this is the best day for it. So celebration was definitely in my weekend for sure. But quite often we think of parties, don't we? Anyone else think of food? Because you can't have a party without food, right? And I love, I like bring on the snacks people because there's something about celebration that is about feasting as well. And those who seek after Jesus, right? You think of the meal that we have just participated in together, right? It's food. It's a celebration. And I'm gonna get to some of the celebrations and the feasts that actually we as a community, we can learn so much from, from the Old Testament style of feasting. But when we think about spiritual disciplines, quite often they can be very serious business, can't they? Celebration doesn't typically be the one at the top of the list because this is supposed to be about very inward looking, very serious, thinking about all the things. But yet all of that is meant to push us to be people with the biggest smiles on our faces, filled with joy, celebrating because of what God has done. Aaron and I were in Leeds two weekends ago visiting some friends and we were flying out through Manchester. So we got to like have a little walk around Manchester. And we heard this young man standing on a crate with a microphone declaring the gospel. It was class. The words coming out of his mouth were phenomenal, right? Incredible truth, incredible good things that he was saying. But oh my goodness, his face didn't show it. His tone of voice did not show it. He sounded boring. In fact, I turned to Aaron, I was like, no offense like to him and what he's doing, but I actually don't even think I want to follow Jesus anymore. Listen to that. Like it sounded so boring. And he's saying like, Jesus has come to give you life and his fullness. I'm like, mate, that's the most incredible verse and you're destroying it. You're destroying the whole thing, right? Because there's something where our news, the gospel is good news. What has been done for us is good. And we have to remember that in celebration style, we are celebrating what God has done absolutely everything for us. He who started the good work is going to finish it until completion. And there's something about celebrating, right? Where it's an act of surrender in so many ways. Celebration is surrender. You're saying there's nothing more to be done. There's something about it being finished. Your task is finished. Everything is finished, which it has been. Jesus declared that on the cross, by the way. And celebration occurs because we've something to celebrate, right? And celebration comes whenever we acknowledge God is actually in control. You can experience deep joy when you just let go, right? Whenever you let go, trying to control all the things. This is why I'm convinced children are really, really good at this, right? Because they have nothing to worry about. Children are singing and dancing majority of the time. I know some of you are going, if you had heard my kid, that was not, they were not happy last night. They were screaming and they were awful and they were throwing tantrums. But majority of the time, children are living carefree, play filled lives. Why? Because they don't have a worry in the world because they're trusting that their day is going to be good because parents are trying to cultivate an environment where the day is good. Do you and I believe that our father is trying to cultivate an environment? We've sang about it. We'll sing about the goodness of God. Do you wake up expecting what good thing is going to happen today? And here's the incredible thing. Even if something bad happens, we hang on to this hope that even in light of something not looking good, we have this promise that he will turn everything for good, even when it doesn't make sense. So even in the chaos and the wildness of it, we still have something to celebrate. I want to get my inner Charlotte into me right now. So Charlotte, I hope you're feeling better, but I'm just going to channel her spirit for a minute because in Genesis, right? If you don't know why that's funny, Charlotte loves Genesis. She's obsessed with Genesis. I love that she's obsessed with Genesis. It's class. But in Genesis, God reveals his heart for celebration, right? What does he do? He creates. And then he sits back and goes, that's good. And he does that. And then he creates mankind and he goes, that's very good. And what does he do on the seventh day? He enjoys it. He enjoys it. And do you know what I think is so beautiful, which is the best part of this story, he's enjoying what he's done. But mankind's first day is enjoyment because God's done it all, right? You and I, original design were created to live in the fullness of what God has done, to enjoy the thing that he created. And I think there's such a beautiful invitation. Even in the very beginning of the story, we were supposed to be celebrated and to enjoy what God has done and to celebrate him in return. Do you and I trust his hands in what he's doing? Even when it's chaotic, even when we don't understand, joy is supposed to mark us. Augustine, the early church father said that the Christian should be one big hallelujah from head to foot. There is much to celebrate. You think about Christmas time and what we kind of talked about at Christmas, the shepherds on the field with their sheep and an angel comes and is like, behold, I bring you great news, good news of great joy, which is gonna be for all people. You think about Jesus when he talks about abiding. Why? Why does he tell you to abide? He says, I've told you these things that my joy would be in you and that your joy would be full. There's something where we have to look and see and understand what God has done. And only when we rest in his work are we ever gonna be people that celebrate. And some of us need to stop trying to figure it all out and need to stop trying to work it all out for good. He's the one that does that. And I know it's really hard to trust in a really difficult scenario. I know it is really difficult, but that's when you have to lean in to the scriptures that he loves you, that he is for you, and that he is a very good God. The interesting thing in the story of God is that Israel had a celebration rhythm in its calendar and they had feasts all of the time. And there's a portion of scripture at Exodus 23, 14 where it says this, three times a year, you're to celebrate a festival to me. There was three celebration moments that they just had to participate in. They were compulsory, right? They had to do this. And the interesting thing as I reflected on this is that you think of their story, there's times where their story is going good. There's times that they're in captivity. There's times when they are struggling with really difficult things. And God doesn't go, I see you've got it hard. You don't have to party this year. I see it, you're all right. No, you're going to celebrate because there is much to celebrate. We've talked about one of them already this morning. And the first one that was compulsory was Passover. It was compulsory to celebrate Passover because this was the story of freedom, right? The story where the people were taken out of captivity and brought towards freedom. The second festival was one that was celebrated 50 days later. It's known as the Feast of Weeks. It would later get its new name and would be called the Feast of Pentecost, which means 50 days, right? So Pentecost is Greek for 50, am I right? Yes, Gary, come on, amen. Dr. Jill in the house, right? But Pentecost means 50, so 50 days after Passover, then there was this other feast, this other celebration. And what they typically celebrated, yes, was harvest, but actually was the giving of Torah, right? They would have this day where they would celebrate the day that the Lord gave them the law. And what was really typical, and imagine this scene, because I just think this is where the Bible is just so class. Not only does Passover link to the crucifixion, but what you have in this Feast of Weeks, this Feast of Pentecost, are people turning up to the temple. And the thing that they're meditating on, the thing that they're chanting is Exodus 20. They're talking consistently about the day the Lord gave the law. And of course, what happens 2,000 years later on that day? Well, they're celebrating the law. Yahweh gives what? His Holy Spirit, right? Which is what you and I get to be joyful about, right? Because he steps into the story in an incredible way. The Holy Spirit was given as they're celebrating the law. Tell me the Bible's not cool, right? And then you've got this third one called the Feast of Tabernacles. Also was this time whenever they would have a feast of shelters, and they still do that, where they go out outside in tents. And basically it's a celebration of their journey through the wilderness. It's saying that when the story was weird and didn't make sense, wasn't he good? Wasn't he present to us? Didn't we see him do something? This temporary location for us was to become something so much more permanent. And this is our story. Jesus, the Passover lamb, not only participates in the meal, right? And serves us the meal, but actually is the meal, right? Full, full, wholeness. Everything you and I need, find in him. That's what we celebrated this morning as we took communion, knowing that I was like all pumped up for this. I was really trying hard to not go whoop, whoop after we took it, right? Because it's a good meal. It's a party. We are meant to celebrate everything that God provides for us. Then of course, the Holy Spirit. And this idea that we have become not just temporary tents, but we've become a dwelling place, right? A permanent residence for the Holy Spirit. That's who lives in you right now. It doesn't surprise me that when Jesus begins his public ministry, he declares something really cool because there was a feast of all feasts, right? A feast of all feasts, which, feast of all feasts is quite hard to say. And interestingly, a lot of people reckon that this one might not have ever been celebrated. Let me read the scripture to you that Jesus reads in his first time in a synagogue. Look forward, it says, the spirit of the Lord is on me because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to set free the oppressed and to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor. The year of the Lord's favor was known as the year of jubilee, right? And the idea behind it was that there was always a Sabbath rest, like a weekly Sabbath rest. And then within that, there was a seven-year Sabbath rest, like a very holy Sabbath, where every seven years, there was supposed to be a year where everything kind of chilled, chilled the beans, right? And then every 49 years, it was supposed to be seven times seven, it was super holy. It set you up for a year in your 50th year that was the year of jubilee, which was the year where lots of things were to happen. Now, just imagine, I want you to think that this was the way the world operated somewhere. You're like, yes, Jill, please let it be. But in the 50th year, this is, it was like a big, massive reset. If you owed money, it was like, your debt, it's gone. It's fine. All the accountants are like, what, can't just do that, right? Then you've got land. If someone had come in and possessed your land because you couldn't afford it and there was a transaction made, your land was given back to you, right? So you got your debts cleared. You got your land give back to you. And if you had find yourself then as a person slave to someone else to pay off your debt, you were told you were released, right? You were free. You were free to go. This was supposed to be the thing that God's people did. And there's no evidence that they ever did it. And I can sort of see why. The land was also to be given a rest. They were told what you normally do in working the land, you're to let it rest. You're to let it breathe. And you don't, you're going to trust me. You're going to trust me that you're going to have enough. And they never did that. Now, can you imagine if I told you right now, right? Everything's canceled. You're like, whoopee, but you don't have to go to work. You all of a sudden would start have these questions of provision, right? You would all of a sudden go, well, how am I going to live? What's going to happen? Because we consistently are told in the pattern of our lives is that we've got to do stuff. We're not used to someone coming along going, you don't have to do anything. You just enjoy your last lot of work. Your last years of work have been amazing. Now you just get to enjoy it. We are constant go-getters. The year of the Lord's favor. This is what Jesus then comes along. And he says, I'm declaring right now a year of jubilee. And in so many ways that the people were supposed to practice this in the physical, but it was always to point them to something spiritual because this is what Jesus was getting at. This year of jubilee that he talked about was a complete debt cancellation for all of us, which is really good news by the way, because we owe God a lot, right? We owe him a lot. We deserve a lot of punishment and a lot of judgment. We owe a debt to sin and our debt has been canceled. That is the good news of Jesus. He can be trusted with everything. He has done enough and he is enough. He is God's ultimate provision. And he declares over you and I a year of jubilee, a year where we can enjoy all of his work, right? Where you and I get to celebrate the fruit of his labor, God's ultimate provision. You think about Jesus and his first miracle, right? Where was it? At a wedding, at a big party, right? So do you see the threat of God going, it is good, we're celebrating, we're having a party. My people are gonna be constant partiers regardless of what's going on, we're gonna party. Why? Because I'm the provision. I'm the one who has your life in order. You can rest, you can relax. The interesting thing when we get to the New Testament and Paul's letters, I'm a fist, I'm nearly done, I promise. But when we get to the epistles that Paul writes to the church, he does something really interesting because he changes the story slightly. So instead of Exodus being, you shall have festivals and feasts three times a year, you shall rejoice three times a year. What does Paul tell us to do? He says, rejoice in the Lord always. And then he goes this, he goes, I will say it again, rejoice. Right? So there's something where you and I are supposed to be a joy filled people, not three times a year, right? Not Christmas, Easter and others, right? We're supposed to be rejoicing always, but how? How do we be people who rejoice when we've got all this stuff we're really worried about? Right? How do we be people who rejoice when we're constantly wondering if we're good enough? Paul gives us a little hint of how we be joy filled people. He says, don't be anxious about anything, right? You wanna know what's stealing your joy? It's all your little worries. It's all your little concerns. Your eyes are on the wrong thing. Do we believe this morning that God is good, that he holds you in the palm of his hand, that he's got your story, even when it looks weird and wonderful and rubbish, he is still a good God. I love what Richard Foster put in this, in his book. He says this, we find it so foreign, right? To be anxious for nothing is so foreign to us. We have been trained since we were two years old to be full of care, right? We start from the age of two to notice that there's things that we've got to be careful about. That's scary, isn't it? Under twos, let's be under twos. Let's be really baby toddlers in the church. It says the spirit of celebration will not be in us until we have learned to be careful for nothing. And this is why jubilee was so important, a crucial celebration that no one dared to celebrate because deep down they didn't trust. They didn't trust that God had the ability to provide for them. Jesus comes and announces a jubilee and he's an invitation, do you trust me? Do you trust me? Because we are people who are invited into this love story, this gospel story, this good news where God loves you and you love him. And actually our lives are supposed to be years of jubilee, rejoicing always and enjoying his grace. There's loads to celebrate. What does celebration look like for you? And that's a question I want you to think about. When was the last time you actually celebrated? Because you know what's super important is to throw the biggest, wildest worship celebration in the middle of your drama, right? God didn't give them permission to not feast just because they were in exile. God didn't give them permission not to feast because people were always hunting them down and chasing them and doing all things. He says, no, I want you to remember that I'm God, that I've got you, that I provide, that I always have provided and you can chill, you can rest, you can be anxious for nothing because I hold your world, not you. Celebration in our house typically looks like a lot of noise like Josie, bless her, was sleeping and very quickly learned through my screaming voice that Lily had passed her test and Josie's like, yeah, banging her floor and we're celebrating. Heidi got her results and she was celebrating but interestingly enough, was more vocal about her football win yesterday. She plays for Linfield. I know that makes Paul Reed very happy but they beat the boys 7-2. So Heidi's like, girl power. So she was more excited about her Linfield win than she was about her SEAG results. And then of course we celebrated, right? When Lily's landmark moment, when your kid learns to drive, let's celebrate those things. It's feasting. Dare we be people who celebrate other people even when they win, right? I don't know if you've ever been in a scenario when the very thing you've been longing for your mate gets, anyone, right? That's a true test of celebration. Am I gonna surrender to the story? Oh God, I thought I was gonna get that but yay, you got it, right? Yay, rejoice always. But this is a true test of God working in us. Christ being formed in us. The thing that I think is super important and Margaret Baird actually gave this word in Inner East a couple of weeks ago. We are, actually Beatty, you're here this morning. You participate in this too. But Margaret put a thing on Facebook that was about saving a penny every day, right? So that at the end of the year, so like today is what, January 28th. So today I'm gonna save 28p. And you basically just build it all up for the rest of the year. And Margaret gave this prophetic word off the back of that and was like going, isn't it so interesting that it's just an extra penny, right? Every day, just something very little, very, very little. But yet at the end of the year, it's gonna feel like a lot. And she really felt that God was inviting our church, right, CFC in general, into this idea of dropping little pockets of thankfulness every single day, right? Even when you're looking at your life and you're going, I am not thankful for any of this. I guarantee you there is something to be thankful for. Even if it's a roof over your head, there's something where we've got to start practising thankfulness and gratefulness and celebration and joy. And of course, today we celebrated Communion. I'm gonna invite the band back. I had to text these guys first thing, as I'm going, I know today was supposed to be meditation. So I know every worship leader will have picked like a really reflective song. We were gonna sing as the deer pants for the water and I'm going, no, no, no, I'm doing celebration. Let the deer keep panting, it's fine. He gets filled, he gets filled, it's fine. Because God is good and he fills us. And I would love us to just even think, just to even meditate. There we go, we'll do our meditating today. Meditate on what the Lord has done for you, right? You should not leave this space sad this morning. If you do, come and speak to me and I'll give you your money back, right? But genuinely, God has done everything for you. All the debt you owed, right? Everything that was held over your head, Jesus has wiped it clean for you, has taken everything on to him. And you and I get to simply do what? Enjoy the fruit of his labor. It is finished. That's what he declared on the cross. It is finished. This curse over mankind, broken. Sickness, broken, healed, right? We have something to be thankful for today because God has done everything for us. Why don't you stand to your feet and we will worship him and lift his name over everything that we're walking through, amen.
