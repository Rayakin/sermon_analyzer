Welcome to the CFC podcast. Before we get stuck in, I'd like to take a minute to let you know about our Compassion Appeal. Every year, CFC's Compassion Appeal impacts thousands of lives across Northern Ireland. People struggling with basic needs like putting food on the table, keeping warm and getting school uniforms for their children. The book of James that we've been studying is very clear about our responsibility to outwork our faith in our actions, and the Compassion Appeal is a great way to do that. If you'd like to join us in making a real difference in the lives of those who need it most, head to thisisscfc.com, that's thisisscfc.com, where you can give to this year's appeal and see what a difference your generosity makes. Thank you. My name's Richard Gardiner. For those of you who don't know me for visitors, part of the community here at CFC, part of the eldership. And I've been joined by my lovely helper, Genesis, yeah, either, because God is my helper and Catherine is my helper as well, this is my wife, Catherine, do you want to say a few words? He just didn't want to be outdone by Charlotte and Andrew last week, so he liked this, so he thought, who can I drag up here? We can do that. A bit about us, we've been part of the community here for over 30 years. 32. 32 years. Our daughter, Georgia, turned 30 this year. Yeah, shock, I can't work out how that happened either, I don't really, I said to Catherine, am I not 30? And she assures you, I'm not anymore. So Georgia and Ryan live in Bristol, she's a teacher over there, they're getting married this year. They're getting married on the 12th of July. Any someone from Northern Ireland would choose to get married on the 12th of July, and nobody in England knows what it means, but we'll be there anyway. So she's there, Sam, our son, is married to Jess, they live in Bristol as well, he's an engineer there, and then our son, our youngest boy, Joel and Nadia, they're here in Belfast, part of our community in Antrim, and hopefully, soon in Hollywood, they're moving to Cumber, they're getting married in February. And since I last stood up here, or last spoke, we also became grandparents, I've got a picture of Finlay, he's up there, I hope. You have the second loveliest boy, Dara. He's lovely. So yeah, Finlay was born, so we're grandparents, and again, I can't work out how that happened. We're in a series on values, and since Gibba and I couldn't remember the five-fold ministry last week between the two of us, we messed it up, I did write down, because there's ten of them, an emphasis on praise and worship, centrality of prayer and the Word of God, obvious ministry of the Holy Spirit, relational Christianity, a focus on body and ministry, and the priesthood of all believers, and that's what Charlotte and Andrew picked up on last week. And if you weren't here, if you haven't seen that, or if you haven't watched the follow-up teaching on that, on 1 Timothy, I really would encourage you to listen to that, watch it online, just really, thank you so much, Charlotte, for what you pour in, we are so privileged to have you leading us and teaching into that, I really encourage you to look at that. Heart for evangelism, reaching the lost, planting them into church, a world vision with involvement in overseas mission, concern for the poor and disadvantaged, and a desire for social justice, a prophetic voice to the nation, reclaiming non-anti-sectarian and non-discriminatory Christianity, and the unity of believers regardless of church affiliation, Priscilla, did Paul come up with all that stuff? That's great stuff, all those years ago, and Charlotte did a horrible thing on me about three weeks ago, she emailed me and she said, we're doing a series on values, just pick whichever one you want, and I was like, oh no, Pastor, tell me what to preach on, don't give me the choice, and I picked another one, and just last week, I just thought that we should look at relational Christianity, and I think Mary the Lord's in that, given what we've heard already this morning. The message of the gospel is incarnational, we're about to go into that period in our season whenever we go into all of the Christmas madness, and we love it, it's already Christmas in our house, trees up, the grotto's been made, and I know, it's like, whatever. Mr. Grinch loves it. Yeah, no, whatever, but in the middle of all of that Christmas stuff, and we love all that, and we love the candy canes, and Love Actually, and all those movies that we watch about Christmas, I think, they say familiarity breeds contempt, I think we need to be careful that in the middle of all of this, we don't lose that incredible truth that John writes about, that the wood became flesh, and made his dwelling amongst us. The message says, he moved into our neighborhood, we have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. And scripture, when you read this sweep of scripture, God reveals himself in so many different ways. In Psalm 19, it says, the heavens declare the glory of God, the skies proclaim the work of his hands. Throughout the Old Testament, we see supernatural acts, we see a burning bush, we see a pillar of fire. In Numbers 22, God uses a donkey to speak. Thankfully, he's moved on a little bit from that. I hope this morning's better than that, than a talking donkey. He uses angels, he uses visions, he uses the intervention of the Holy Spirit, but the pinnacle, the height, the culmination of that great sweep of scripture is the truth that the Father is revealed to us, because he took on flesh. Somehow, in the mystery and the wonder of the incarnation, the one who flung stars into space restricted himself in the human form. He becomes a baby in a manger, and the purpose of all of that was a revelation of the fact that we are loved. The Father loves us. John 14 says, talking to Philip, Jesus says, anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. And there's an echo in this, and Charlotte and Andrew reminded us last week that in reading scripture, we need to look at the broad sweep. We need to look at that big story that God has been writing from eternity past, and will continue to write into eternity for the future. And there's an echo in Genesis, because in Genesis 3, it says, the man and his wife heard the sound of the Lord God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day. Not only does God create man and woman and place them in a garden, he then walks in that garden with them. He doesn't abandon them or leave them. He walks with them, and God's original purpose and plan was always to be with us. And there's a future promise as well, of course, in Revelation 22, 21. It says, look, God's dwelling place is now among the people. He will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. He will wipe every tear from their eye. There will be no more death. There will be no more mourning. There will be no more crying or pain, for the old things has passed away. And so God desires to dwell with us, and that's an incredible truth and promise. The challenge for us, of course, is that he chooses to do it through us, through his church, through the followers of the way, this called-out group of ordinary people who have had a supernatural encounter with a supernatural God. Writing to the church in Ephesus, Paul says this, because of God's great love for us, he who is rich in mercy made us alive in Christ, even when we were dead in transgressions. It is by grace that we have been saved. And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus. And then he talks about the reconciliation between Jew and Gentile, this breaking down of that division. And then he says, you are no longer, speaking to us today in his church, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God's people, members of his household built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone. In him, the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord. And in him, you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his spirit. God still is incarnational in his church, in his people. He dwells in us individually and collectively. He lives not only in me and in you, but he dwells in those spaces between us, his church. He truly inhabits the praises of his people. And you'll remember that beautiful story at the Feast of Tabernacles when Jesus stands in the last and the greatest day of the feast, and he says, if you're thirsty, come to me and drink, and I will put a river of living water within you, the promise of the Holy Spirit. And so do we believe in signs and wonders? Absolutely. More Lord, more Lord. You know, I love, yesterday morning we were sitting, so remember Charlotte asked me three weeks ago what I was going to speak on. I said prayer and the word of God, then changed my mind last weekend. Catherine and I were sitting yesterday morning about half nine in our dining room, just chatting about what we were going to do this morning. And I got a text note, a voice note on text from a number that I didn't recognize. It was Jane Nott. I don't know if Jane's here this morning. It was a message from Jane Nott about a dream that she had three weeks ago about Catherine and I speaking together and about ministering together. Don't you just love the fact that there is a God? I mean, there is a God and he's active and he's moving and he's prompting and it's dreams and visions and it's so supernatural, yes. Do we eagerly desire the spiritual gifts? Absolutely. We eagerly desire, especially the gifts of tongues and prophecy. Do we believe in a visible manifestation of the supernatural power of God? Absolutely. But all of it flows from a deep understanding that he dwells in us and that we dwell in him. Signs are there to point us to the one who sent the sign. And so often in my life, I've got caught up in the signs and forgotten the one that appoints me towards. There's a deep understanding in us that he dwells in us, that through the power of the death and the resurrection and the ascension of Jesus, the hope of his return and the promise of his Holy Spirit, that he dwells in us and he dwells amongst us. And of course, we see in Genesis 3 that that's all broken. When sin enters the world, everything gets broken. And it's not just our relationship with God. It says that man and woman prided out were naked. This beautiful imagery of people being without shame, nothing's unknown. Everything is there. Everything is open. Their relationship is open. They're with God. And all of that gets broken. The relationship with God gets broken. Man's relationship with woman gets broken. Man's relationship with God, he says, the woman you gave me, Lord, gave me the apple. The blame game begins. Poor Eve is left there. She's never been lied to. And suddenly her relationship with this man that she's placed with, this is broken. In Genesis 3, we see, Genesis 4, we see Cain and Abel, family murder, families break down. As we go through Genesis, we see the nations break down. All of it leads back and is contrary to God's purpose that there would be relationship. And what God's redeeming, it's not just about me and Jesus. It's not just you and your small corner and I and mine. It's about the restoration of the community that he created, of men and women living together, celebrating. And that's been part of our journey as a church. It's always been part of us, that two-wing church that we talk about, celebration and gathering like this and across all of our sites, but also small group and connection. And over the years, we've called it many things. We've called it home group. We've called it cell group. We've called it connect group. We've tried different patterns. We've done the four W's. Anybody remember the four W's? Remember what they were? Yeah. Worship, word, welcome, and works. Yeah, they are. We've had interest groups. We've had men's groups. We've had ladies' groups. We've had Bible study groups. We've had intergenerational. All of it is with the same purpose of encouraging all of us to realize that we are called into relationship. We are called into community with God and with one another. And the truth is that I learn more about God as I see Him working in your life, and you learn more about God as you see Him working in my life. And we learn more about God as we wrestle and we struggle with those areas where we don't understand what God is doing, but we journey that together. In John 17, it says, my prayer, this is Jesus praying for us, is not for them alone. I pray for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them may be one Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me. I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they might be one as we are one. I in them and you in me, so that they may be brought to complete unity. The world will know that you have sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me. And so, whether you're in the room or watching online this morning, down in Caffey Church, across all of our sites, across his church globally, his crazy plan is that somehow, if I have a look around you, that us, this mismatch of peoples and experience and fears and questions and things to celebrate, that somehow as we learn to love him, and as we learn to love one another, that the world learns that they are invited to be part of that. What does that look like in practice? Because relationships are challenging, aren't they? I mean, relationships are just difficult, and that's why I brought my wife. That didn't, that sounded better in my head, the link. So I suppose what we wanted to do was talk a little bit about our journey in CFC and how significant that's been for us. And I guess I wondered why anybody would want to listen to that until this morning began to unfold and Dara was telling her story about Arlo. And I hope that in telling our story, that people will be encouraged, not just in their walk with God, but also to get involved in a connect group, because connect groups have been so pivotal in our journey in CFC. We came to CFC 32 years ago in a very different place to where we are today. We were separated and our marriage was not working. We've been married for three years and we are spectacularly good at mucking up our marriage. We are really, really good at it. And so Richard had started to come along to CFC because the church that we had been going to was my family church. My dad was an elder there and he came here. I was raging. I've just about forgiven him for it 32 years later, because I had been wanting to come to CFC for years and he was not having any of it. I said it was a cult, I actually preached on the fact that it was a cult. As you can see, my preaching back then had a big impact as well, it hasn't held back the growth of the church. So whenever we got back together again, we started to come along here to let the dust settle before we would go back to the church that I'd grown up in. Six months later, we were still here and decided to try out one of these home groups as they were then. And we came away that first night from, I'm going to try and hold it together, from a home group run by Erin and Lila Steele. And we came out and Helen Mills was there. And we both said, this feels like home. And we started to get involved and roll forward another couple of years. We didn't really let anybody into what was going on in our relationship, we'd papered over the cracks, but we certainly hadn't really put anything back together again. And two years later, all the problems resurfaced again. But this time we were here. And this time the church gathered around us. I remember sitting in Paul and Priscilla's front room, where Paul said to us, if we worked 150% of our marriage, he would give us a 50% chance of staying together. I was reading about that as well. Spent a lot of time angry. And people were put round us to walk a journey with us back to healing and to wholeness. And then we were put with Edwin and Ann Blakely. And they met with us every week for a year to unpack the mess that we had made of our own lives and to help us put it back together again. We then started a lead connect group out of that with Edwin and Ann. And then we went on to be part of a connect group. I'm looking around the room today and I'm seeing Penny and Michael and I'm seeing Paul and Louise and I'm seeing Robert and Caroline, who were with us in those pivotal first connect groups when we were young. And I loved being part of a group with people that I felt, now they may contradict me here, but that I felt had got their acts together and knew what they were doing with their lives. They had young children who could teach me how to be a parent and who got involved in our lives, who got to know us really, really, really well. And those relationships that grew out of that still carry on to this day. I think the interesting thing for me about Edwin and Ann was we went through that whole process and we owe so many people a debt that we'll never repay. But at the end of a year, it was like they knew everything about us. And it was like, it was either you're going to be, we're never going to be in the room with these people again, because they know everything, or, well, why would we be in the room with anyone else? Because they know everything. And that's how we ended up leading a connect group with them, because it was like having gone on that journey, it was never with Edwin and Ann, it was never them sitting, judging what had happened. It was them trying to understand and walk with us and share that journey. And I know I sat at the back of church when I came here originally on that back, and you need to be careful if you sit in that back row, because Jesus gets you down there as well. You know, Jesus can reach right down to the back of this room and right through that camera to wherever you're sitting in your home today, because his desire is to dwell with us. But it was that home group and those connections that really made it feel like home for us. And I think one of the things that somebody said to me back then was, you can't drive a 10 ton truck over a one ton bridge. And, you know, I have no right to speak into many people's lives here, because I don't know you. And if I was to challenge you, without having built that relationship with you, you need to strengthen your relationships to give people the opportunity and the place to be able to speak into your lives. And through connect groups is an absolutely outstanding way of doing that. Connect groups evolved over the years, challenges came and went. One particular time that highlights it to me, there must be something in the room today about babies. Our third child was born almost 10 weeks prematurely. I was exceptionally ill throughout that entire pregnancy. And Joel, now six foot three, you wouldn't know to look at him, but now that anything was ever wrong. But our connect group arrived round at our house one day, we'd just done a lot of work on the house with an extension and I was too ill to really do anything at all. And Hilary McVitie arrived round our house one day with the connect group in tow and painted our extension. And you talk about those things, the food thing, lasagna is a thing that Christians make, it is whenever they want to feed you. We moved on then as our children grew to lead an intergenerational connect group, which again brought so many beautiful people into our lives. We had the grandparents of the group, we had David and Heather McVie, who I also see are here today, who imported so much wisdom to all of the younger parents in the room and all of the younger kids. We had a great time doing that. We had a brilliant nativity one Christmas, I wrote a nativity play and we acted it out in our kitchen. A group of 20-25 disparate people all dressed up in nativity gear and those relationships carry on. As Richard's already said, our kids live in Bristol, but Ned and Jackie Kelly, who were part of that group, were in Bristol yesterday having lunch with my kids and I just love the fact that Georgia, our daughter, went through a very, very difficult time a few years ago with a broken relationship and Jackie plugged in with her every week. Ned and Jackie, most of you here will know, but they live out in Serbia, but yet faithfully Jackie checks in with Georgia, see how you're doing. And I love the fact that there's other people out there that are checking in with my children. I know that I've done the same for Ruth and Alistair when Ruth was walking through her cancer journey, checking in with their girls. You can't underestimate the value of those relationships. Not every Connect group, however, that we've been involved with has been a great success. We were asked to go into a Connect group to help out the leaders and within six months, nine people had left the group and three of them had left the country. Not going to lie, it's not always. Not quite the plan. And then we moved on to a post-alpha group. We took a group of people that had gone through the alpha course and for me that was, at first I felt like a proper grown-up to be honest. We got the opportunity in that to show the love and the grace and the mercy that had been shown to us in our early years in church and to be able to walk through, because when people have gone through alpha and have renewed their faith or come to a faith in Jesus, their so many questions still after alpha is over. And so to spend years with people and build relationships and there was one of the girls in the group, and we're still really, really good friends with her and her husband, who came from a Catholic background and had a lot of Catholic guilt going on there who kept every week turning around going, when are they going to tell me to leave this group because I'm not perfect, I'm doing things that I don't think are right. And for us to be able to go, we're never asking you to leave this group, we love you, we want to journey with you, has been one of the greatest privileges of our lives. I think that conversation happened about half one, one morning after we'd had dinner together. It didn't happen in the Connect group, it didn't happen on Sunday morning. It's a bit like teenagers, you have to be available when they want to talk. You can't talk when you want to talk, you have to be available. The privilege of people giving you access to their lives, of being vulnerable and open, I'm just always conscious, we stand on holy ground when we're invited into other people's lives to share our story and share your story and build together. And I suppose, why is our story important? There's hundreds of people in this room could stand up here now and give their stories and all the threads all weave together as we walk in and out of each other's lives. But I think that point of connection is that relational Christianity, the importance of bedding down and getting to know small groups of people, and it flows and it changes. And of course, often not without its challenges, and what do you do in those challenging times? Not all relationships last forever, you don't stay friends with everybody forever. You can hurt people, people can hurt you, and that is where I think you very much need to develop the art of forgiveness, because we are all called to be a family. CFC is family for us, and in the same way that I don't always like all my own family, or agree with all my own family, then the same thing happens in church. And I suppose this is as good a platform as any, if we have hurt or upset anybody here, that was never our intention, and we would ask your forgiveness in that. In the same way as people who have hurt us over the years, we continually walk in that journey of forgiveness towards them, because it's a family. So for us in the difficult times, it's never been an option to walk away from this body, because this is our family. And I said to Richard the other day, I kept going, it's family, isn't it? It's family, isn't it? He said, you sound very aggressive. And I went, no, it's not aggression, it's passion. You'll do anything for the family to whom you are directly related, and so CFC for us is that family for whom we would do anything. And I think for me, it's interesting as time has evolved, I think you think about all the things over the years, 32 years, that God has done in this place, and all of the different programs and the different seasons, and they're all great, and they all have their time and their place, but it's not the heart of what God calls us to. The heart of what God calls us to is this incredible grace community that says you're invited to be part of the family, no matter where you've been, no matter what's been done to you, or what you've chosen up to this point in your life to do, God's invitation to us is come and be part of the family, come and be part of my family, come and be restored and redeemed back into that original design where he makes his dwelling place with us. We are enriched by the people who we come in contact with, and as Katherine's mentioned, some of them, and there's hundreds of them in this room and right across, and I think of Hugh Jervis and what Hugh taught me about the pastoral heart of God, Bobby Moffat, just what Bobby's revealed about God to me, Alistair Roy and Pauline, we wouldn't be the people we are and the family that we are without that input. Ron England, who's like the Holy Spirit, I mean, you can't be in this building when Ron's not here, Ron's here, but just Ron's heart for worship and the Word of God and just so many people, and we are all heroes of the faith, not perfect, but family called by his name and followers of the way. And yeah, I'm going to ask the worship band to come back up. It was interesting what Zara said earlier, Mark, about Arlo, about that expect a miracle. Whenever we were trying to conceive for the first time, that was proving very difficult, and we were going through some tests and procedures and stuff, and we were praying one night, and it's the only time in all of my journey as a Christian that I would say I heard the audible voice of God. I don't know whether it was audible, but it was so real to me. It was like he was spoken, because we were sitting and we were praying, and we were praying for this child, and I heard this voice say, call your son Samuel. And I said to Catherine, why Samuel? And she said, what? And I said, why Samuel? And she said, what are you talking about? And I said, you just said, call your son Samuel. And she said, no, I didn't speak. That's how real it was. And of course, Samuel says God has heard. That's what Samuel means, the Lord has heard. And God hears our cry. God hears our prayers. God is not distant. And Finley's first name, actually, I don't know whether Sam realized this, but is that last slide up behind me? Sam has called his son Finley Samuel Richard Gardner. It's quite a big, the full kennel name, as I call it. That's his full kennel name. It's quite a mouthful, isn't it? But he is still the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I don't think Sam thought he was being prophetic. But there's something that I heard, and I thought, he's still the God of the generations. He's still the God of every generation. And there are people in this room, and we're journeying along with you. And at the moment, we've got kids, and we're just not sure where they're at, or the struggles that they're facing, or the stuff in their life that we might historically have somehow communicated to them that meant they weren't invited to the table. And we as a community need to do a better job of saying this is a place of grace. This is not about who the world says you are, or even how you see yourself. This is about how God sees you, and you are faithfully and wonderfully made. And if you're in this room this morning, and you've never made that decision to hand your life over to the King of Kings, can I just encourage you this morning? He loves you. He saw you before you were in your mother's room. You know, Zara has promises that God spoke to her about her unborn child. God has promises that he has spoken over your life. And it plans to give you hope. And it plans to give you a future. And it plans to invite you into a wonderful relationship with him, and a wonderful relationship with his family, which won't always be straightforward, and will sometimes be challenging. But it's who he created you to be. It says the word became flesh and made his dwelling amongst us. He moved into the neighborhood, and we have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only son who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. The Psalmist said, he places the lonely in family. Why don't you stand with me, and we're going to worship. Father, I thank you in this place that we have found grace and truth. Lord, you're the way, the truth, and the life. Father, you have invited us because of your grace into your family. And Father, I pray this morning that no one would feel on the outskirts. No one would feel excluded, or unwelcome, or uninvited. And Lord, that we, as we love one another, and as we journey together, and as we choose to forgive, and as we choose to encourage, and as we choose to wrestle together with those difficult questions that we face in life. Father, I pray that the world would see that you are not safe, but that you are good. That you are good, Lord, and that you are faithful. Amen.
