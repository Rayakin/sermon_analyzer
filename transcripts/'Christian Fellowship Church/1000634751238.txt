Welcome to the CFC podcast. Before we get stuck in, I'd like to take a minute to let you know about our compassion appeal. Every year, CFC's compassion appeal impacts thousands of lives across Northern Ireland. People struggling with basic needs like putting food on the table, keeping warm, and getting school uniforms for their children. The book of James that we've been studying is very clear about our responsibility to outwork our faith in our actions. And the compassion appeal is a great way to do that. If you'd like to join us in making a real difference in the lives of those who need it most, head to thisiscfc.com. That's thisiscfc.com, where you can give to this year's appeal and see what a difference your generosity makes. Thank you. Sunday the 12th, we looked at our cultural values in CFC, what makes us us, who we are, and why we believe what we believe. We looked at the topic of women in leadership from a broad biblical perspective, like a wide holistic biblical view on the topic. It's on the YouTube channel, and it's probably a good idea to have a look at that before you watch this one. We're going to go into a passage, a specific passage, which is often brought up to us and said, well, what do you do with this passage? And that's 1 Timothy 2, and it's verses 8 to 15. I think it's fair to say whatever stance you take, you're going to find something in these verses which are complex and can be a little obscure, can be potentially divisive, and also can just be unclear and need a really good look at. So we're going to read it. We're going to discuss what's unclear or what are the complexities and what are the obscurities. And we're going to try to unpack that from our perspective. So let's read together 1 Timothy 2, verse 8 to 15. I want us to think, firstly, what a passage. I want us to think, firstly, is Paul being contradictory here? And what do I mean about that? Well, is he being contradictory in his own practice? Are his words lining up with his life as we know it and what he's been up to? So say, for example, he says it doesn't permit a woman to teach yet. In his life, he has traveled on his missionary journeys with Priscilla, who was a female and was a teacher. So we know in Acts 18, for example, that Priscilla has pulled Apollos aside, and Apollos is described as a mighty man in Scripture, and she has been teaching him the ways of God more accurately. We know as well that in Paul's own letter to the Romans that he gave to Phoebe as a leader of the church and as a letter carrier. Again, culturally in those days, the letter carrier would have taught the letter to the church that she was bringing it to. So is Paul contradictory just in his own lifestyle here, in his own ways? I wonder as well, is Paul being contradictory here in his own writings? Like he wrote in 1 Corinthians 13 and 14 that all should pursue spiritual gifts, whose spiritual gifts are listed, and one of them is teaching and also the gift of prophecy, propheseo in the Greek means to divinely teach with divine power. So it's really like important spiritual gift, and Paul is like saying all should pursue these to eagerly desire them. And if ever there was a moment to put a mandate in for women not to do this would be then, but it's not there. He then goes on to say in this passage, so is Paul being contradictory? I think no, by the way, but I just want to bring that question to highlight some of the complexities in this passage. He then goes on to say that women are saved in childbearing, which all will agree is definitely obscure and complex. And so what actually is Paul saying is here? How do we understand Paul's meaning with all of these things going on in these few verses? We suggest, and as we have looked at this and studied it together, that this passage actually comes into focus. So the unclear parts of it actually come into focus when we read Timothy in the context of Ephesus, what was going on particularly and specifically in Timothy and Paul's life in this specific region at this specific time, and particularly with a religion that had such a stronghold in this place. So it is just important, isn't it? Whenever we read Scripture at all, it's a hermeneutical principle. Hermeneutics is just our understanding of how we interpret Scripture. To always think about the context in which anything is written, because we are not in the context of the writing, the original writing. So we always have to work really hard to go back and understand the context of any Scripture whenever we're reading it in order to get clarity. And what's really helpful here is, though Paul's writing this to Timothy, he starts by saying this in 1 Timothy 1 verse 3, it says, as Paul writes this, So a couple of things that we can ascertain from that is, he's talking about Timothy in Ephesus, so we know where this is being set, the letter is in the context of Ephesus, and we know that Paul is particularly concerned with the concept of false teaching. We know that not just from how he opens this letter, but also how he closes it. So the whole letter of 1 Timothy is really bookended with this concept of false teaching, as we read there in that verse. And then as he closes out his letter in 1 Timothy 6 verse 20, we read this, So it's really obvious that the main thrust of this message is about false teaching, and it's false teaching in Ephesus. So the question then, the obvious question is, what would false teaching in Ephesus look like, if that's what this letter is primarily about? Which is brilliant, because there are other books of the Bible that we can look at that have a lot to say about this. We can find that out. We can find that out. So if you turn in your Scriptures to Acts chapter 19, you're going to see about a riot in Ephesus, and what the riot is over, and actually it's about a different kind of teaching, or a different kind of faith. So in Acts 19 we read this. I'm going to read a few verses just to give you a feel for that passage, but it's all the banter, you should read the whole thing. Acts 19 verse 23, it says, So that's an important name there. So Silver Shrines of Artemis brought in a lot of business for the craftsmen there, and he called them together. So he calls them together and he gives this bit of a speech, and this is part of the speech. He says in verse 27, There is danger not only that our trade will lose its good name, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be discredited, and the goddess herself, who is worshipped throughout the province of Asia and the world, will be robbed of her divine majesty. Your translation might say Diana instead of Artemis, but the Greek there is Artemis underneath it. When they heard this, they were furious, and they began shouting, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians. Even that phrase is so important, isn't it? Artemis of the Ephesians. And soon the whole city was in uproar, and then verse 34 is an absolute cracker. But when they realized he was a Jew, it says, Big worship set. Big worship set, and the only lyric is, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians for two hours. They're literally screaming this because Paul's teaching is coming in, and it's causing economic chaos as well as everything else because Artemis is the goddess of the Ephesians. Great is Artemis. So they're very, very concerned about her. So the cult of Artemis, Huge. Obviously huge. You don't shout about her for two hours if she doesn't matter. So she is absolutely huge. And so whenever we think about the faith, the way of Jesus coming into Ephesus, it's coming into the context of the faith of Artemis and the worship of Artemis. So we really need to understand who she is. Yeah, and Artemis is so, so important. Obviously in the day that Paul was visiting it and establishing the church, which he does, but also then he urges Timothy to remain there and to continue teaching the way of Jesus into the context, into the culture, into the cult of Artemis. And it is a cult, like the temples, super amount of statues to this goddess. But who was Artemis and what was the cult of worship? She was quite the blade, Artemis. Blade, by the way, means woman. It's an unimportant term for a woman, sorry. The cult of Artemis is really interesting. And this is where the Bible gets complicated because the average reader, all of us who are reading, we read that phrase, oh, great is Artemis. But who knows who Artemis is unless you're a student of ancient mythology. So let me give you a little breakdown of who Artemis is. So Artemis is a Greek goddess. She is the daughter of Leto and Zeus. And the thing you need to know about Artemis is she had witnessed, in this myth, she had witnessed her mother in a really arduous nine-day labour. Her mum was giving birth to her brother Apollo. And it was so arduous, in fact, that Artemis afterwards requests from her father that she would be protected from the arrows of Aphrodite because she does not want to ever get pregnant. Having been pregnant, I totally get that. It's like, it's no crack, guys. So she doesn't want to get pregnant and she becomes symbolic of... She becomes a goddess of virginity and particularly in Ephesus, becomes really, really connected to midwifery. So she becomes a goddess who women look to in order to protect them when they're giving birth because she has a particular compassion towards women in labour. So she protects them while they're giving birth but also has been known to do a mercy killing should the labour be going on too long. So actually she doesn't just protect life, she can bring death to a lady in labour. So, like, you can totally understand as a woman... Huge. ..Artemis is everything. Because if she is not honoured, if she is not worshipped, your life is literally at risk if she's displeased with you. So Artemis is a real stronghold and what you're going to find in the worship of Artemis then in Ephesus is there are a lot of women particularly involved in the worship of Artemis, a lot of priestesses, there's real ardent worship of this woman. Now, whenever you say all of that, do you know what all of a sudden becomes a little bit clearer? Why Paul is saying women will be saved through childbearing if they continue. You know, when we read in that passage, it's really complicated, he says in verse 15 of 1 Timothy 2, but women will be saved through childbearing if they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. It's like almost he's saying, don't be afraid to follow Jesus. Like even if you follow Jesus, if you continue in the faith, he'll keep you safe. You don't need Artemis. So you can start to see how the cult of Artemis is playing into this passage. Yeah, and it's important to note as well, Artemis has taken on this title of saviour. Yeah. And actually she is protecting and guaranteeing protection for women who are pregnant and who are going to give birth. Artemis is able to save the child and able to save the woman. So that's really, really significant. So Timmy, Timothy, Timmy. Timmy. Timmy. I've read him that much, me and Tim. I actually have a brother called Tim and I call him Timmy. It's definitely not the same Timothy. He's never even been to Ephesus. But what Timothy was dealing with was this sense of women who we know have come out of the faith. There's been a real disturbance of the cult of Artemis. They've left the faith of Artemis. They're coming in, but they're concerned. They're worried about the whole life up to this point. They have been worshipping the goddess. She's been guaranteeing them protection as their saviour. Paul's now bringing in saviour language of Jesus. And so he's writing into this context for Timothy to make sure that the false teaching of the savouring, the saving that Artemis brings is nothing in comparison to the saving that Jesus brings. And so it's like you will be safe. You will be saved from the danger of childbearing, even if you're not in the cult of Artemis anymore. There's a reassurance here that you're going to be safe, even if you have children, and to come away from the false teaching of the cult. Yeah, and I think that also it's important to note that this cult of Artemis is creating certain social dynamic in Ephesus. That can't be overlooked. Whenever we read then some of the more specific instructions about women in authority, women in teaching, it can't be overlooked, the social dynamic that's coming through this. So not just in verse 15. So we now start to go back into the passage, verse 13 and 14. Yeah. OK. Because Artemis is... So Artemis thought these very pious women and evangelists, I think, of the faith because they want everyone to worship Artemis. The more people worship Artemis, the safer Ephesus becomes for women. So they're evangelistic in their outrage of this. But also Artemis isn't the only cult. Whenever you start to look back, you realise that alongside that there's this Egyptian myth of Isis and Ra, which also becomes really important. And these two myths actually are quite... They're intermingling, really, in Ephesus. So Isis is this female goddess who usurps Ra, who's a male god, usurps his power, and that's how she gets greatness and power. So the woman that they're looking to, the goddess that women are looking to, is usurping by force, taking male power in order to have greatness, and that is the epitome of womanhood. Yeah. And so we've got this Isis cult... And Artemis. ..that's intermingling with Artemis. And then alongside that you have part of the Artemis cult is this idea that a woman didn't come from man. So in the Genesis tradition, we have, you know, the female coming from the male. But in Artemis, it's the man comes second. It's, you know, the woman comes first and the man comes second. Yeah, and I think that's really important because the Genesis account, which obviously Paul's super versed in as a scholar and as a Jew of the Jews, you know, he's writing this letter to Timothy, and when you read that initially, you're thinking 13 and 14 seems a bit strange, but whenever you're writing against a false teaching which states that woman comes first, and in some way a woman actually... Because, remember, Genesis is about equality of male and female in the image of God. But here we have actually a usurping of that narrative where actually the female becomes one who is authority and actually is the author of life. The man comes from the woman, which is not what...this is not what Genesis says. So Paul then writes to Timothy to make sure, again, because, remember, he's writing about false teaching, makes sure that that false teaching is taught against, and that's why 13 and 14 are found in the manner that they're found in. It's, again, speaking into this idea of this Isis cult from Egypt, this Artemis cult of the Ephesians, which are now one. The statues of the goddesses are often used together in worship. It's into that context that Paul writes this about the order of creation. That's why the creative order is reinforced here. I think it's really important then to note that what this has created is a social dynamic where it's not equality, like you said. It's not equality. Genesis is about equality. And that's what Paul is hoping for, you know, even when he writes in other places about mutual submission. It's a call to the redemptive nature of this story is that we're going back to equality and we're going back to wholeness. And so I think it's really important to note that what has been created in this culture is women who are... It's not about equality. It's about domineering. It's about subjugation. So we've got strong... And not in a good sense of the word strong. We've got strong, domineering women who are subjugating men and taking things that are not even their own, you know. So I think that that's really important. You've got to get a feel for the women in this cult and a feel for the women in Ephesus before you begin to look at what Paul's writing into. And then it starts to make more sense, doesn't it? Well, I think so. Whenever you understand the context of the Den language, it's really, really important. Not just... Well, in all of scripture, language is super important. But there's some words here, and what I alluded to at the start, there's complexity about the language that Paul uses here, because, actually, a lot of the words that Paul uses here aren't used anywhere else in scripture, even when there are other times where it could be used. So, say, for example, authority is something that's used quite a lot in scripture. But Paul uses a word for authority here which is not used anywhere else in scripture. And it's a particular type of authority. So, yeah, why don't... Charlotte, talk to us about authentic... You're a bit of a... You love your Greek. Oh, bless you. Well, you do. Gary, if you're watching this, you know that that's true. Yeah, I think it's important, like you say, it's important to note that even though... When we read the Bible in English, there can be a word that looks like it's appearing a lot, but, actually, when you dig under it in the Greek, there's lots of different Greek words that are translated into the English. And the same English word can have 17 different Greek words under it. That's an exaggeration, but you know what I mean. Maybe five. And then, whenever you begin to read, you can understand that the translators have a task trying to translate the Greek into English, particularly whenever, like you say, whenever we start to meet words that don't... They're not anywhere else. So, to begin to get a feel for what that could possibly mean when you don't have multiple contexts, like, well, it meant this here and this here and this here and this here, so it must kind of mean this. When that's absent, it makes it really difficult to translate. And so, when you begin to read this passage, not only does it feel a bit odd and a bit obscure, but the Greek underneath, it's also unusual. So, will we start with the first few words? Yes, let's go. I think, obviously, as somebody who would know an awful lot about this, let's talk about hair. So, if we go to 1 Timothy 2, for example, verse 9, and it talks about the apparel that women are wearing. But first of all, it says, not with braided hair. Or elaborate hairstyles, because that's what my translation says. OK, so there is difference also in translation. So, depending on how you translate... Well, what is elaborate hairstyle? That's interesting, isn't it? What's allowed and what's not. If we're saying that this is easy to understand, are we saying that a woman cannot wear a plait? Yeah. Again, so people will say, like, read the text clearly. It clearly states women should learn in silence. We'll get to that, by the way. But just read the text clearly. But you've got to be consistent with the clarity of your reading of the text. So, if you're saying, well, that means what it says, well, then also this must mean what it says, so you can't have braided hair. And, to be honest, as a woman, if God says I can't have braided hair, I don't want braided hair, so I need to know if that's what this is saying. Because, like, I don't want to wear braided hair. And is this elaborate? Like, is this what you... Am I elaborate? Because I did brush it before I came on camera. Is this elaborate? Is that vain? I don't know. I mean, I took more effort, put more effort in than you did, probably. I put a shirt on. That's about as elaborate. Well, is that fancy clothing? Could be. Anyway, let's get into the Greek. OK. So, because it's being translated, elaborate hair says, it's being translated, plaits, Paul's saying that you shouldn't have them, so what is going on here? So, the word underneath that in the Greek is plegmason. It's a hapax legomenon. Yep. It's a big word for you. It only occurs once in this writing. There's nothing else to compare it to. It only occurs once in Scripture. You can not find that anywhere else. No, alongside some other words. And what's interesting is there are some words in this section of Scripture you'll not find anywhere else. Even in Paul's other writings, you're not going to find them. So, Paul's not lifting from his other writings, so where is he lifting these words from? Well, we'll propose... We'll propose something to you. At the time of Paul's writing, there are obviously other people writing books, and one of those surviving books is a book called The Ephesiaca. It's a novel, which is interestingly about a guy and a girl... Male, female. ..who live in Ephesus and who are part of the cult of Artemis. And interestingly, the words that we can't find in Paul's other writings, these really specific words, are found in that novel, which was written at the same time as Paul's writings. So, it's located in Ephesians. It's written about a male and female relationship. In Ephesus, yeah. Sorry, in Ephesus. It's about two people who are male and female and they're in the cult of Artemis, worshipping. And why is that important? You're saying it's not in the Bible, sure, it's not important. Why is it important? It's important because it's giving us a window into the words that are being used in culture at that time and how they're being used at that time. Because we can't find these words in other places in Scripture to try and understand them. And so there, what you're going to find and it's the word plegmason and it's a really, really specific kind of way of doing your hair, which was used in the worship of Artemis because it was a reflection of Artemis herself. So, the women who worshipped Artemis would have done their hair in this particular style, which was plegmason. That was the style of hair that was used in the worship of Artemis. So, Paul is saying to them, don't be doing the things that you did whenever you worshipped Artemis. Get your hair out of those flats, for dear sake. You don't worship her anymore. There has to be a distinctive change in you. So, that specific word means a specific thing that we miss in our English but, bet your bottom dollar, Timothy understood what that meant. And that's the word plegmason. And it's the same whenever you get the hematazo polyteli. I mean, who knows? Hematismo polyteli. The clothing. So, that's the Greek word for the clothing that Paul refers to in verse 9. And again, that's really, really important because the priestesses who were in the cult of Artemis, who were obviously leading the worship and involved in the rituals and all of the cult that went around that, that's what they were wearing. And again, the language is used nowhere else other than the aphesiac about this couple who were in this relationship in the cult of Artemis. So, that word for costly clothing meant something to Paul, meant something to Timothy, which just loses its meaning today. But when we understand that it's written about that particular religion and not adhering and being in that particular way of worship, you've come out of that, that then makes sense. It's not just talking about maybe having a fancy shirt in church one Sunday. No, it's not about, you know, get your Nike jumper off. No. It's the specific language that's lost that is the priestesses' garments. That's what that word, himatismo, polytale, is under expensive clothing. So, that's super helpful. Ready for the next verse where it starts to get exciting. Exciting, yep, go for it. So, let a woman learn in silence. And full submission. With all submission. All of it. With all of the submission that submission brings. Interesting. Let a woman learn. That's really important. Paul is advocating learning. Paul is advocating learning for women. That's very, very significant in the time, and I actually think it's consistent when we read Paul and understand Paul. Paul can be misunderstood as somebody who is against women because of Versalicus, but actually I think when we understand them in culture and context, we'll actually see that that's not who and what Paul was about. So, let a woman learn, I think, is important. The second thing is in silence. That's an interesting word. Because it doesn't mean, it's not conveying the meaning of just sitting there and shut up and be quiet. It's actually in stillness or restfulness. Taking yourself away from distraction. So, it's about focus more than shut up and be quiet and just listen. It's not meant to be read or interpreted in a harsh sense. It's rest and sit away from distraction and learn. With all submission, but again we know that Paul in Ephesians 5.21, whenever he writes that passage, let all submit to each other, it's always done in mutual submission. And so, it's into the context of mutual submission is Paul asking a woman to learn in submission. Now, we'll get to what she's learning and why she has to learn in the way that she does. And again, you should probably start to join the dots there. She's probably having to learn because she's coming out of a cult and a different way of religion, a different way of leading, a different way of being. She's going to have to learn away from that, away from the bustle of that, away from the complexity of that and into a new way of being. And she has to do so with all submission, but again we all have to mutually submit to one another. That's what Paul teaches. So, it's not that strange actually that he should ask a woman to be submissive in this context because he's also asking men to be submissive in other places. And also, it's not surprising in a context where I think we've shown that women are the complete opposite of submission. It's like very domineering. So, any of us who struggles with being domineering and taking power over people, we all need to learn how to submit. So, it's not a surprise that women need to learn how to submit. Yes, but that's it. Well, yes, that's important. Yeah, well that will become important whenever we get to the next verse. When he says, I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man. Yes, and it's the assuming authority and the learning in silence and submission that are connected. And we'll get to that just in a wee minute. But what do you mean I do not permit a woman? Because that is interestingly translated. Yeah, I do not permit. It's really an issue of tense. The actual tense is I am not permitting. Which might sound like it's a big deal, but it's actually really, they're very different. I do not permit and I am not permitting are two very different things. So, let me show you like this. If I say to you, I do not eat prawns, you're going to think, Charlotte doesn't like prawns. She's not eating prawns today. She's not eating prawns tomorrow. She's never eaten prawns. She doesn't like them. I do not eat prawns. But if I'm eating my dinner and I'm saying, I'm not eating prawns, you're not thinking Charlotte never eats prawns. You think she's not currently eating prawns. I'm not eating prawns. But I do not eat prawns is something else. I actually don't eat prawns. I don't like them at all, just in case you're baffled. So you're not eating prawns and you do not eat prawns. Both are true. So, when he says, I am not permitting, which is a better rendering of the Greek because of the tense. It's a current, time bound command. I am not permitting in this context, in this season, in this moment. I am not permitting. I do not permit. Which makes much more sense whenever you see him walk and work alongside women who do in fact teach. And he seems to be fine with it. Yeah. In fact, he eagerly calls people to pursue it. Interesting. So I think that word, the tense of that word is important. And then we get to, it doesn't permit a woman to teach or he's not permitting a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man. So this is where it gets, you know, I think this is part of the verse that people find really difficult with women in leadership. The word authority. But the word authority is used a lot of times in scripture. And it's never this word. So this is another one of our hapex legomenons. This word's not, so it's translated authority but it's not used anywhere else. Usually the word for authority that's most commonly used in the New Testament is exousia. Because all authority's not bad. No. Like God gives authority to people. So authority is not a bad thing. But this is a bad kind of authority. So the Greek word is... Ophentane. Yeah. It's ophentane. And so it's not used anywhere else. And what it actually means is, is domineering authority. It's authority that's usurped and taken. Which, to go back to Isis and Ra... Well that makes sense because that's exactly the cult and the culture and the religion of the one that they were following. That's exactly what she did. She took the power in a domineering and subjugation type of way and used it for her own advantage. That's what the word means. And it sits really culturally applicably in with the cult of Artemis. Yeah. And you can understand why he doesn't use the word exousia there. Yeah. And it makes sense then that he's saying, you know, it's almost like Paul's saying, this is the way that it was in that cult. And remember he's urged by Paul to write against false teaching. Yeah. This is the way that it was in that context. It was your use to ophentane. But I do not, I am not permitting a woman to have ophentane over a man. So it's like, don't take that negative use of authority and power and use that over somebody else. Yeah. It's just it's about not taking what doesn't belong to you from someone by force, which is really what's happening here. So don't take authority over a man. She must be quiet. That's the same word that we've already discussed about stillness. And then so then what do you do with this next bit? For Adam was formed first, then Eve. So you're like, why are you now talking about Adam and Eve? But it makes perfect sense when we remember that in the cult of Artemis. Their creation narrative's different. It's the opposite. They're saying that women came first. So he's correcting, again, false teaching. And it says, Adam was not the one deceived. It was a woman who was deceived and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing. And Paul cannot mean that Adam was not sinful. No. And this is the thing as well. This is another one of those, to go back to the start, you know, the complexity of this. So for Adam was not deceived, does that mean Adam wasn't, didn't sin, but the woman being deceived fell into sin? Well, Paul clearly believes that Adam sinned. If you go to Romans 5, Paul's own letter, verse 21 to 20, sorry, 12 to 14, you'll read there that, you know, through one man sin entered the world. And he talks about from Adam to Moses, transgression was passed through. So Paul is clear in his theology around Adam's sin. But again, when he is, when you're reading this in the light of correcting false teaching that's coming in from strong, powerful, domineering priestesses from a cult who are bringing all of that into their space now as the church, as the young body of Christ that is growing and developing here, which Paul's really passionate about protecting. That's why then he then writes this in, and it then makes more sense, especially when you hold Paul's view of Adam and sin in light of his other writings. When they're held together, you're like, well, that's not what Paul could mean here. But when you understand the context that he's writing into, then you understand why Paul is clear to bring this teaching in around, it's not about, it's not about, it wasn't woman formed first and man came from woman. And furthermore, it wasn't about what woman sinning and man not sinning. That's not what Paul, that's not what Paul believes, and that's not lining up with his other writings. So it has to be contextually written against what he's coming up against, or what Timothy's coming up against. Yeah, which makes sense. Well, why would you then flow from that to a woman will be saved through childbearing? Does that mean that if you don't have children, you won't be saved? Yeah. Because when you read it in the English, it can look like the word for saved is even the same, which by the way, it's not. But it's just not plain, but you can understand then whenever we're coming against this Artemis cult, where Artemis is the one who's going to save you when you give birth, you can understand why that really makes sense to Timothy reading this, and it really makes sense in the context of Ephesus. I think there's a really strong robust case for the fact that this makes most sense in context of Ephesus at the time, and this cult of Artemis that we know from Acts was rife. And I just think whenever you read it in that context that, and to be really really clear, there's been a lot of good scholars who have done some great work on this, like Lucy Peppitt who'll be familiar to many of you, and Sandra Glan, and have done some great work on this. And I think it makes sense whenever you read it in light of that, the obscurities and the strangeness of the language suddenly starts to become a bit clearer, and sorry, not a bit clearer, it actually becomes quite clear. It becomes a lot clearer, and it just goes to show the importance of context whenever we read any of these things. Context is key. And we've covered those verses, hopefully, verse by verse, and in enough detail. So to wrap that section up, you can understand why if you've got women who have been priestesses in the cult of Artemis, they have been strong leaders, that now Paul is calling these women to come into a position of learning, to learn about the faith before they take the same roles in a different space, with none of the knowledge, and without the character development that's going to require to disciple them out of the ways that they have been in, the way any of us needs to be, in order for them to function fully in what they're now being introduced to. And that makes sense whenever we read Paul then, who's really comfortable with women teaching in other places, who's really comfortable with people such as Junia being an apostle, who's really comfortable with women as prophetesses, as speaking under divine power. So that all, those women can do that because they're coming from a different cultural context and background, and those women from the cult of Artemis will also get there once they've gone through any sort of discipleship program, which we would do today. It's just good leadership, guys. Don't put someone in leadership until they're ready. I think it's good leadership to put people in positions of influence, and authority, and teaching, because as James has told us in our recent series, don't always want to pursue to be a teacher, and that's because your words have power. So if you're going to bring words with power, you want to be a person who's trusted, discipled, come through a process, not straight out of a cult, or just because you were a leader there, you can lead here. You come in with your plaits and your priestly robes and get going. Exactly. Look what we had to do with Charlotte when she came from Portadown. We had a lot of sorting out today. I'm only joking. Cheeky rascal. But, yeah. As we close, I just want to jump ahead slightly to 1st Timothy 3, just as a wee aside, but also to bring us back to why this actually matters. 1st Timothy 3, verse 12 says, And again, this has been inferred, and still is today, that because it's saying let deacons be the husbands of one wife, that deacons can only be male, or church leaders can only be male. But again, hopefully now we can apply what we have learned in the first wee bit of this 1st Timothy's letter. We can see that actually, well, culturally that makes sense at that time. Because again, women are coming out of a different way of being. They're maybe not at the stage and able yet to be deacons. And again, we know then, as we look at Paul, who's quite happy for Phoebe to be a deacon. He's quite happy for Phoebe to be the carrier of a letter and a teacher of a church. He's quite happy for Junia to be named as an apostle. He's quite happy for Philip's daughters to be prophetesses and do all the things and occupy all of the leadership roles that the gifts of the Spirit bring. It highlights the importance of culture and context and not just to take one verse like that out of its context and then say, well, there you go. This means that all church leaders and deacons etc. have to be men because it says about husbands. Again, we go into the context and understand the culture. We hold it in light with all of the other scriptures that we have and then we make some informed decisions around that. But why does it all matter? It matters to us at CSE because we believe in the gifts of the Spirit and we believe we have gifted women in our church. We believe that we have women here gifted in these areas and gifted across the church in these areas. And we believe in a fully equipped body of Christ. We believe that if a woman is called and equipped and gifted by the Spirit to teach and to be a prophet and to be an apostle that they fulfill that as part of their calling and obedience and stewardship of the good gifts that God has given to his children, not just to one particular part of his children. And lastly, to bring the good news of the Kingdom of God, we believe it also follows in the way of Jesus as Jesus was risen from the grave, women carried the good news. So we think it's a gospel issue and living into the shalom and the goodness that God has for us in the Genesis story of male and female being in the image of God together. So that's why we think this matters. Hopefully that's been helpful. And will we pray just as we close? Holy Spirit, help us as we grow in our faith together, as we pursue the way of Jesus together, as we look to be led by your Spirit, as we look to open your Word and have your Spirit reveal it to us and truly to be a lamp to your feet and a light to our path. In your name and for your Kingdom. Amen.
