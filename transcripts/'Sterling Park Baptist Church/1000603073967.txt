Our sermon passage this morning is second corinthians 5 11 through 6 13, which you can find on page 966 of the church bibles Therefore knowing the fear of the lord we persuaded others But what we are is known to god and I hope it is known also to your conscience We are not commending ourselves to you again But giving you cause to boast about us so that you may be able to answer those who boast about outward appearance Not about what is in the heart For if we are beside ourselves it is for god If we are in our right mind it is for you For the love of christ controls us because we have concluded this That one has died for all therefore all have died and he died for all That those who live might no longer live for themselves, but for him who for their sake died and was raised From now on therefore we regard no one according to the flesh Even though we once regarded christ according to the flesh we regard him thus no longer Therefore if anyone is in christ, he is a new creation The old has passed away Behold the new has come All this is from god who through christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation That is christ god was reconciling the world to himself Not counting their trespasses against them and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation Therefore we are ambassadors for christ god making his appeal through us We implore you on behalf of christ be reconciled to god for our sake He made him to be sin who knew no sin so that in him we might become the righteousness of god Working together with him then we appeal to you not to receive the grace of god in vain For he says in a favorable time. I listened to you and in a day of salvation. I have helped you Behold now is the favorable time behold now is the day of salvation We put no obstacle in anyone's way so that no fault may be found with our ministry But as servants of god we commend ourselves in every way By great endurance and afflictions hardships calamities beatings imprisonments riots labors sleepless nights hunger By purity knowledge patience kindness the holy spirit Genuine love by truthful speech and the power of god with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left Through honor and dishonor through slander and praise We are treated as imposters and yet are true As unknown and yet well known as dying and behold we live as punished and yet not killed As sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing yet possessing everything We have spoken freely to you corinthians. Our heart is wide open You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted in your own affections In return I speak as to children widen your hearts also Have you ever been in a situation where you expected someone to stand up for you and they didn't I remember a time when I first went on staff as a as a pastor at a church back in the early 2000s I was green new to the gig and i'd been tasked with preaching On the following sunday evening It was intimidating there was going to be 75 pastors in town for a training event They would all be present at the sunday evening service. They were going to hear my sermon to make matters worse this church had a Regular sunday evening sort of review of everything that had happened that day and these 75 pastors Were going to be invited there to give their feedback on my first sort of feeble attempt at a sermon So I was nervous to say the least Make matters worse than that the passage that i'd been assigned was one that dealt with a particularly sensitive issue An issue that's difficult to discuss in public So that week I went to the lead pastor of the church. I asked for his advice on how to negotiate this sensitive matter in the text He was in the office with a mutual friend of ours, he gave me some very specific advice That I followed to the exact letter in my sunday evening sermon I preached my sermon Careful to follow the pastor's instructions on dealing with this Sensitive issue not wanting to make any kind of misstep in my first sort of official sermon as a staff member of the church Later that night when it came time to review the sermon we went around the room Everyone was sharing their comments and their input for the most part. Everyone was polite encouraging But we got about halfway through the evaluation process one of the people in attendance Commented that he was really upset with the way I talked about this sensitive issue Said I thought it was really unwise what you said and really unhelpful I was taken back, but I thought i'm covered right The lead pastor he's going to step in and defend me He's going to explain that I was simply following his instructions But to my surprise nothing And as almost always happens in this situation The criticism starts to snowball Right once somebody voices an objection everybody else piles on So now everyone as we go around the room is just crushing my sermon right and particularly the way I spoke about this one issue And the pastor remained silent I figured well, he's going to let everybody say their piece and then when it gets around to him He's going to explain that I was just following his instruction So I tried to take the criticism as graciously as I could I assumed that uh, in fact, I would be vindicated in the end And so when everyone was done sort of crushing my sermon and got back to the lead pastor He simply said yeah, I think you're right. I probably wouldn't have said it that way And started to move the conversation on to the next topic Now remember I told you a mutual friend had witnessed the conversation and he was here that night And he interrupted the lead pastor said hold on you told him to say that And the lead pastor said did I? Well, that was a mistake and we moved on Now in the big deal in the big in the long run not a big deal, right But here I am probably almost two decades later And I still remember that sense of expecting someone to step in and defend me and they didn't Our passage from second corinthians chapter 5 this morning. The apostle paul is writing to a church That was harboring some of his harshest critics There were some in the church at corinth who objected to seemingly everything about paul Right his personal appearance his weakness His lack of charm and eloquence They objected to his decision to support himself by making tents in the city By making tents in the city They criticized his change of travel plans It seems from verse 13 of chapter 15 of chapter 5 that Shelby joe just read for us that some of his critics were even claiming that he was out of his mind Right that he was perhaps too emotional too passionate too single-minded And so as we've seen throughout this letter Paul is put in a position of having to defend himself To defend his ministry He has to commend himself to this church that he planted If you remember back when we were considering the beginning of chapter 3 some months ago We said this idea of commending is really important in second corinthians And so in verse 12 of our passage for this morning paul says this in second corinthians chapter 5 verse 12 He says we are not commending ourselves to you again But giving you cause to boast about us So that you may be able to answer those who boast about outward appearance and not about what is in the heart See paul saying he doesn't want to have to commend himself to the church yet again Instead what he wants to do is simply point out things that they already knew truths about his ministry That they should be able to use to defend him That they should be able to use to answer his critics and opponents You can see paul expects that the church Should be defending him against these opponents He says that these opponents are those who look on outward appearances Rather than on what's in his heart Paul's quick to concede in other places that his outward appearance isn't very much but here in our passage for this morning He's going to tell us about the heart of his ministry On the outside paul might not seem impressive But if you look closely his work is characterized by a heart of gospel love and integrity So he says there in verse 11 of chapter 5 Therefore knowing the fear of the lord We persuade others But what we are is known to god And I hope it is known also to your conscience Paul begins with the idea of knowing the fear of the lord The fear of the lord This is pretty clearly referring back to where we left off last week if you remember in chapter 5 verse 10 Paul reminds us that we will all one day face the judgment seat of christ And so now he says that his ministry Is conducted in light of that future reality right knowing the fear of the lord The fear of the lord is an important idea in the bible. It's not necessarily Fear in the sense of abject terror But usually it points to the the awe and the reverence that the lord is due Paul knows that he will one day face the evaluation of the lord. Jesus christ And so he conducts himself accordingly. He conducts himself with appropriate awe and reverence He conducts himself in the fear of the lord And in light of that paul presents his ministry Here in relation to three different parties So he presents it in relation to outsiders So there in verse 11 paul says that they try to persuade others Right. So in light of the fear of the lord, right knowing the fear of the lord. They try to persuade others Right because jesus is going to return and judge all people paul and his ministry team work hard to persuade others To convince other people to believe the gospel message that they proclaim He also presents his ministry in relationship to god there in verse 11 He says despite everything that his opponents might say about him Paul says my ways are known to god This has been a repeated theme throughout second corinthians. Paul is conducting himself with integrity and honesty before the lord Right. He's not ultimately worried about the judgment of any other person But instead his eyes are focused on the judgment of the lord. Jesus christ And then finally here paul presents his ministry in relationship to the corinthians themselves He says that he hopes that what he is is known to their conscience as well The idea as we saw there in verse 12 is that the corinthians should be able to defend him against his opponents Against those who would criticize him again. The outward appearance might not be much but his motivations his goals were unimpeachable So paul says there in verse 13 He says if we are beside ourselves it is for god if we are in our right minds it is for you He's saying in essence whether or not you think he's crazy Everything that he does is based on his commitment to god and to the people of corinth and Therefore he shouldn't have to commend himself right his life his ministry. It's an open book As we consider what paul is saying in this passage What i'd like to do is take two aspects of paul's ministry that he describes here and and Two things about the way paul conducts himself that that ought to commend him to the corinthians and think about them So first, let's look at the apostle's ministry of fruitful suffering We'll see that in chapter 6 verses 3 to 10 And then second let's look at the apostle's ministry of reconciliation We'll see that in chapter 5 verse 14 through chapter 6 verse 2 So the apostle's ministry of fruitful suffering and his ministry of reconciliation. These are things that ought to have commended him to the corinthians So first his fruitful suffering if you look there in chapter 6 starting in verse 3 We see another one of the so-called hardship lists in this letter We saw one such description back in chapter 4 lord willing We're going to see a very long one a bit later on in chapter 11 But the idea for paul is that his personal suffering for the sake of the gospel Which his opponents in corinth actually used against him? Was they used it as evidence that he was a loser that he was a weakling paul actually believed that it was proof That the power of god was at work in him and through him for paul his suffering for the sake of the gospel Was evidence that his ministry was legitimate and god-ordained So you see there in verse 3 of chapter 6 that that paul and his ministry team put no obstacle in anyone's way That is to say paul Made it a point to avoid missteps To avoid mistakes that not might needlessly cause offense Right the point isn't that paul doesn't like to be criticized but rather he wants his ministry to be found faultless His concern was with the reception that his message would receive Remember paul. He's not an egomaniac He's not so concerned about himself and his own reputation rather He understands that he was sent by the risen lord. Jesus with a message for the nations And that's what paul cares about He is careful not to do anything that would put an unnecessary burden or an unnecessary obstacle between people and them receiving the gospel message The flip sides there in the beginning of verse 4 he says that he is a servant of god And not only does he avoid giving offense, but but he and his team positively commend themselves in every way they can He says but as servants of god verse 3 We try not to put any obstacles in anyone's way verse 4 but as servants of god we commend ourselves in every way Then it's starting at the end of verse 4 going all the way to verse 10 paul lists out 28 different circumstances or features of his ministry The 28 things that characterize his day-to-day experience Of taking the gospel out into the world trying not to put any obstacles in people's way trying to commend the gospel to people We obviously don't have time to do a deep dive on all of 28 of these things But there does seem to be a structure that organizes these lists There at the end of verse 4 and verse 5 you have a rapid fire list of 10 ministry hardships That attend paul's work So 10 ministry hardships in verse 4 and 5 the first four they list out are fairly general there in verse 4 He talks about great endurance Afflictions hardships Calamities, right? These are our broad categories of troubles the kind of things that come to paul's mind is he thinks about what it means To be a minister of the gospel. It means that it he is required to endure a tremendous amount Affliction hardship calamity He moves on then to to give some specific sufferings there at the beginning of verse 5 Things that he endured at the hands of others He mentions beatings We know that before paul came to corinth for the first time. He was badly beaten in philippi by an angry crowd It's very likely that when paul showed up at corinth, he was still bruised and battered and scarred from the beating he had received Paul goes on to mention, uh imprisonment there in verse 5 Again, we know he was put in prison in philippi He would be put in prison later in jerusalem and and again in rome a few years later There in verse 5 paul talks about riots Now if you read the book of acts riots are like casual friday for paul right every week Acts 13 there's a riot in antioch acts 14 a crowd at listera stoned him People came from antioch to listera to have another riot In acts 17 a mob in thessalonica tries to rip him limb from limb acts 18 We read that paul's brought up on charges by an angry crowd while he's in corinth Acts 19 we read about a massive riot in ephesus right people were Responding to the the message of christ. Some were becoming Christians, some couldn't care less and other people wanted to riot and and kill paul The last three items in this first section seem to deal with sort of general circumstances if the first Few are kind of broad categories, then he has some specific ways that he's been sort of hurt by other people Uh, we we might say this last sort of few items are the normal troubles of the work He mentions labors there in verse 5 right hard work paul is Engaging unbelievers with the gospel. He's training new disciples. He's resolving disputes in the church. He's he's Raising up leaders carrying on correspondence with all the other churches collecting money for the poor Working to support himself as a tent maker Right paul is is working hard He mentioned sleepless nights Probably in part because there was so much work to be done Right. We think that paul probably sort of plied his trade as a tent maker in the evenings after he was done teaching But also probably because of the emotional toil that the churches and all of their troubles took on him He also mentions hunger Paul's work meant that he would often go without so that others might hear the gospel Right when you put it all together, this was a ministry that required as paul says there in verse 4 great endurance And this is what we've come to expect from paul in this letter Right, he compares his work at another part of this letter to being led in a triumphal procession He says it's like carrying around the death of jesus in his body I think it's a good reminder to us that god generally works in ways that are consistent with the pattern of the gospel of a crucified savior That means that God's work is often carried out in ways that bring suffering and trials Things that we might try to avoid things that we might be tempted to despise like suffering and weakness They're often in god's economy the gateways to fruitfulness There in verses 6 and the beginning of verse 7 You have Eight further descriptions here. So you had a sort of 10 things at the beginning Now you've got eight descriptions of the manner and the means By which paul conducts his ministry So eight things the manner and the means by which paul conducts his ministry there in verse 6 You have four words that describe the manner In which paul goes about his ministry. He says that he he does this by purity right the The word that paul uses there is usually applied to someone's motives, right? He's talking about sincerity here He says that he he ministers by knowledge When paul uses that word in corinthians, it's usually in reference to a personal knowledge of god here Paul saying his ministry is shaped by the relationship that he has with the lord He says there in verse 6 by patience The idea here is waiting calmly for things to work out and then by kindness All right. Paul's ministry is not harsh not abusive But it is gentle and it's concerned with the welfare of others, right? Those are all descriptions of the manner in which paul conducts his ministry Then at the end of verse 6 paul presses into the means by which he does it. He says by the holy spirit in genuine love in truthful speech with a conscious reliance on god's power So again, we see genuine ministry happens in ways that are consistent with the character of god Right that only makes sense If god is loving And if god is kind and patient and truthful Well, then his work can only be carried out in those ways Right. It's not a it's not a coincidence. It's not an accident that paul is characterized by these things That's what god sent him out to do that that reflects the character of the god that he serves Paul's experience of ministry has nothing to do with the manipulative tools of the marketer or the pressure salesman But he wants to do god's work in ways that are consistent with god's character and friends, I think that's actually really clarifying for us Life can be confusing It can be hard to know the best way to handle any specific situation It's true that we're not called upon to exercise and carry out the exact same ministry that the apostle paul was But it is the case that all of us who are followers of christ are called upon to serve him In the spheres where he's given us influence in the ways that we're able And so paul's example here his description of the way he went about his work Reminds us that the work that we're called to has to be done in god's ways The work that we're called to as a church must be conducted in ways that are consistent with god's character So What does it look like to be a faithful mother when a child throws a tantrum What does it mean to lead your team at work through a difficult project that has to be completed? How do you go about confronting a brother or sister who's ensnared in sin? How do we go about resolving conflicts in the church body when they arise? Well, those are all difficult questions they require a lot of wisdom But paul reminds us here that the right answer in every circumstance is going to look like godliness purity patience kindness genuine love A commitment to the truth those things will always be the right answer Right those right answers are only going to be lived out by the work of the holy spirit as paul reminds us here in the power of god Finally there at the end of verse 7 through verse 10 paul completes his list So we've seen 18 things already and he gives us 10 contrasts in his ministry He says there in verse 7 He has weapons of righteousness For both his right hand and his left hand And I have to say as I was sort of initially preparing And reading through and and trying to understand this passage my my first impression is I have no idea what paul's talking about there And then I read the commentators and the scholars and the experts and I was sort of relieved to realize they don't either Everybody's got a sort of thought about what it might be It might be sort of a reference to weapons of spiritual warfare like paul talks about in ephesians chapter 6 But it's not clear at all what paul's talking about What it does seem is that the right hand and the left hand right in terms of Thinking about armory or weaponry would mean that he's he's completely ready to go, right? He's he's not under equipped in any way, right? Some scholars say it refers to sort of offense with your right hand and defense with your left hand if you're if you're right-handed That might be the case But the idea here is that paul lacks for nothing When it comes to the the tools he needs for ministry The beginning of verse 8 we see two more sets of contrasts. He says that that he uh ministers through honor and dishonor He says he ministers through slander and praise And then halfway through verse 8 he launches into another string of pairs, right? And the first part of the pair relates to a way that he might be perceived by outsiders Right tells us a way that that perhaps his jewish opponents or or even the roman authorities that stood against him in almost every city Or even his opponents in corinth might might see paul and describe him So that's the first sort of thing that paul mentions and then the second part of the pairing Reflects what what paul sees to be the truth? So there in verse 8 he says we are treated as imposters Right, they were they were confronted as false teachers, right by the by the jewish leaders by opponents in corinth But but paul says we are true In verse 9, he says as unknown The idea there is that they're they're uncredentialed obscure unimportant not worthy of listening to But paul says we are well known well known to the believers at the church well known to those who have Responded to the gospel of the lord. Jesus well known most importantly by the lord. Jesus himself Paul's already said what we are is known to god He goes on there to say that they are constantly exposed to the possibility of death Right, but by god's grace, they are still alive He says they are punished there in verse 9 right again repeatedly beaten imprisoned stoned lashed But paul says Not yet killed Right not to the point of death There in verse 10. He says they are sorrowful over betrayals false teachers defectors But always rejoicing In what the lord's doing. He's personally poor having nothing Yet through his ministry, he makes many spiritually rich. He has nothing. He says that the world would envy or want Yet he spiritually possesses everything every treasure in christ What a stark contrast All right, paul sees his life the reality of his life as so incredibly different from the way he's perceived by other people Imagine for a second someone invented a pair of eyeglasses These glasses functioned in such a way that when you put them on everything suddenly appeared the exact opposite of how it was before That's how the gospel seems to function for paul That's how the gospel seems to be meant to function in the life of a believer. It takes our normal our natural our instinctive Perception and it turns it on its head So all the things that seemed important before safety money respect Well suddenly put on gospel glasses and those things seem to be completely Unimportant they're trifles Compared to the gift of salvation The riches of treasure that we have in heaven the urgency of the work of spreading the gospel All right, the gospel paul is showing us here Flips our perception of everything And so brothers and sisters If we embrace the gospel We are going to have to be content to be misunderstood We're going to have to be content to live in a world that fundamentally sees everything Differently than we see it So in our workplaces in our neighborhoods, even in our own homes and families We're going to have to be willing to live In a world where we see things differently than everyone else And so that means we might be labeled as bigots And hate mongers Because we don't celebrate the things that the world outside sees as being so dear That means we may be considered narrow-minded Because we have to insist that there's salvation in no other name Than that of the lord. Jesus We might be ridiculed and pitied because we give our money away rather than using it to accumulate more treasure here and now Now We might be considered Radicals and zealots and fundamentalists because we're willing to pack up and go all over the world to make jesus known where he isn't currently Friends we have to be comfortable being the object of pity The object of scorn being considered ignorant and old-fashioned paul was clearly comfortable It was difficult, but he was clearly ready to be misunderstood for the sake of the gospel So john chrysostom the fourth century church father said this in one of his sermons He says people outside the church May think we are sorrowful But in fact, we are always rejoicing We may look poor But in fact, we have enormous riches both spiritual and physical As usual the christian life is the exact opposite of what it appears to be on the surface And friends that's the truth that paul's unpacking in the other section of our passage and in second corinthians chapter 5 verses Verse 14 to chapter 6 verse 2 and so let's let's move on And see paul's ministry of reconciliation having seen his sort of fruitful suffering for the gospel Paul's going to sort of expand this idea of perception being different than reality As he works to see all believers live for christ as he works to see Reconciliation happen. So let's start there in chapter 5 With this second point looking in verse 14 We read there for the love of christ controls us Your translation might say constrains us For the love of christ controls us Because we've concluded this that one has died for all Therefore all have died And he died for all that those who live might no longer live for themselves But for him who for their sake died and was raised So paul starts there in verse 14 saying that the love of christ controls us Right paul's experience of being loved by jesus Was the thing that controlled his ministry? Right the word that paul uses there for control has a sense of urgency Right as if christ's love compels him to action It also has the the sense of constraint, right? It limits the range of options open to him or we've already seen that because of christ's love paul has to act And he has to act in ways that are consistent with that love He goes on there at the end of verse 14 to explain Why it is that the love of christ controls him? He says because i've reached a conclusion What is that conclusion? Well, he tells us there he has concluded that one has died for all Therefore all have died So paul says one has died for all he repeats that you notice there in verse 15 he repeats that again He says he died for all but he's speaking about the death of the lord jesus the sinless son of god on the cross And what we see here is that jesus's death had a purpose. It had a reference point outside of himself It was for Or we could say on behalf of others He died for the benefit of other people As jesus died on the cross He took on himself all of our sin And all of our guilt and all of our shame He took the punishment that we deserve for all the ways that we've rebelled against god Right there in verse 21. Paul gives us one of the most clear and powerful And yet somehow deeply mysterious statements about what happened to jesus at his crucifixion Right. He says they're speaking about god the father in second corinthians 5 21 for our sake He that is god the father Made him to be sin who knew no sin so that in him We might become the righteousness of god So paul tells us god the father made him Who knew no sin? That's the lord. Jesus again. God's sinless son in human flesh Though the one human who has lived a perfect life of obedience to god free from any guilt free from anything blameworthy Right the the image that that paul calls up here is the the old testament practice of offering a spotless Or unblemished animal as a sacrifice to the lord So god the father takes this sinless one the one who knew no sin the lord jesus And and he makes him paul says to be sin for us The idea is that on the cross jesus acted a bit like that that scapegoat In in leviticus that we read about earlier He acted as a sin bearer for us Taking on himself every wicked thought every evil deed bearing the punishment and the wrath and the death that our sin deserves Jesus on the cross became sin for us And he did that paul says there in verse 21 so that we might become the righteousness of god Right the death of jesus on the cross brings about this great exchange So that the theological term here is double imputation Two things get imputed or we might say credited Right something gets imputed or credited to jesus And something gets imputed or credited to us Paul's telling us here that god made him who knew no sin to be sin for us on the cross Our sin our guilt our shame the punishment that we deserve was imputed or credited it was counted as if it belonged to jesus And in exchange the righteousness of the one who knew no sin the holiness Of the sinless son of god Is imputed to us credited to us? On the cross He made him who knew no sin to be sin for us so that in him we might become the righteousness of god Paul says here. This was all for our sake This was for you If you are in christ Friends when we contemplate jesus suffering on the cross It was not just an exercise in god showing love sort of off into the void or in the vacuum No, all of that suffering was for us It was for you The suffering that jesus endured if you are a christian was your suffering That is your death. That is your guilt. That is your shame. He took that And gave you his righteousness as a gift so that you might only ever know the blessing and favor of god Christian can you see how much god loves you? That he would undertake all of this so that you could be saved from your sin and rebellion so that you could be with him forever Right if you doubt for a second that god could love someone like you Well at that moment you're you're ready to understand the cross You're you're ready to be astounded by the love of god because what we see here Is the worst of who we are that the son of god had to become sin for us at the cross And we see god's incredible loving desire to save us Christian god knew Exactly who you would be he knew every sin you would commit And he still sent his son to die for you God knew all of your sin all of your weakness all of your shame all of your failure and in love He made christ to be sin So that you might be the righteousness of god But there there's more Paul says he's concluded that that jesus died for us, but that's that's not the end He he rose from the dead in victory over sin and death you see that at the end of verse 15 paul calls jesus Him who for their sake died verse 15 and was raised Jesus didn't remain in the tomb, but three days later he rose from the dead and there is paul is telling us here this Connection this spiritual unity between jesus and the ones for whom he died and was raised when jesus died Paul says we all died with him, right? We're so connected to him spiritually That that we are dead to our sins as well And when jesus rose from the dead everyone for whom he rose is now alive Like that's what paul means there in verse 15 when he refers to those who live Right if you are in christ You are united to him in his death to sin You have died to sin and its power and its penalty because jesus became sin for you And if you're in christ, you are united to him in resurrection life. You are eternally spiritually alive When the rest of this passage it seems that paul Sees two implications for our lives that flow out of this incredible act of sacrifice on god's part This incredible gift Of a son who would become sin for us so that in him we might become the righteousness of god Because let me point out these two implications with the rest of the time that we have this morning The first implication is that we should no longer live for ourselves There in verse 15 paul says that jesus died so that those who live Might no longer live for themselves But for him who for their sake died and was raised Brothers and sisters, this is an incredible statement of your identity in christ If you've trusted in jesus, you have a new spiritual existence Jesus died for you and was raised for you. And so if you've died with him the old things that you used to hold dear are dead You've been raised with him as well You're now among those who live Because jesus rose for you Right paul saying you have a completely new identity The old you is dead the the new you With a new spiritual identity new desires new priorities has taken its place That's what paul means there in verses 16 to 17 He says from now on therefore We regard no one according to the flesh Even though we once regarded christ according to the flesh we regard him thus no longer Therefore if anyone is in christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away. Behold the new has come Paul says there in verse 16 before he was in christ before he had this experience of dying along with jesus Before he understood what it meant to be raised to new life with christ. Paul said that he regarded jesus according to the flesh That is to say from a purely human perspective Right to him the idea of god dying Inhumiliation and shame for the sins of people was ridiculous But now paul says everything is different. He does so no longer now He's able to see right putting these gospel lenses on he can see jesus for who he really is The crucified and risen son of god and he says now he regards other people In the same way in a new way. He doesn't regard others according to the flesh anymore He sees that anyone who is in christ Is a new creation That the old person has gone and the new has come Friends, it's hard to overstate how radical is paul's understanding of what it means to be a follower of christ He says it's nothing less than a new creation a new identity Friends, this is one of the things that makes christianity different from other world religions So maybe you're a kid Growing up in the church And you think well, okay christianity sounds plausible. But how do I know that? that islam Or hinduism or buddhism or mormonism? How do I know judaism? How do I know? These aren't also valid paths Maybe you're a visitor with us this morning. You're investigating christianity and you're wondering is there really anything unique? About this religion about this gospel. Let me let me just point out that this is one thing that distinguishes the christian faith from every other religion You see being a follower of christ is nothing less than a a god orchestrated transformation of your identity It is not like joining a social club It is not something that can be passed down to you by your parents It's not something that a nation or a culture can enter into together It's not something that can be coerced at the point of a knife You can't be a nominal christian You can't be a halfway christian Because to be in christ as paul defines it here is to be nothing less than an entirely new spiritual reality right, that's how Fundamental a transformation takes place when we are united to him right when we are in christ The end result there in verse 15 those of us who have experienced this transformation Well, we will live differently Paul says that He died for all verse 15 that those who live might no longer live for themselves But for him who for their sake died and was raised Paul says if you've been united to christ if you understand what it means to be To die with him and to be raised with him and to receive this new identity You will no longer live for yourself for your own glory for your own ambitions for your own comforts and your own pleasures He says now we live for him Friends, that's why paul lives the way he does everything we saw from chapter 6 verses 3 to 10 It only makes sense in light of what paul says here That's why paul was willing to endure beatings and jails and riots and afflictions and hardships and calamities Because he no longer regards jesus the way he used to He doesn't regard people the way that he used to and he doesn't live for himself The way he used to Now he says his life is controlled by the love of christ And if anyone is in christ the same thing is true of them Paul says we no longer live for ourselves But for him who for our sake died and was raised I think we get a sense of maybe what this looks like in another letter that paul wrote A letter he wrote to his protege titus We read in titus chapter 2 Paul says for the grace of god has appeared bringing salvation for all people Training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions and to live self-controlled Upright and godly lives in the present age waiting for our blessed Hope the appearing of the glory of our great god and savior jesus christ who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness And to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works Brothers and sisters salvation Redemption from all lawlessness as paul puts it there. It changes the way that we live It changes the way that we relate and posture ourselves with respect to the rest of the world And so if you are in christ by faith It's worth asking yourself Are you actually living out in your daily life these things that are true of you in christ? Does your life give evidence of a new creation of a newness of life Is there anything about your actions Anything about the things that your heart loves? Anything about the decisions that you make and the way that you make them The ways you spend your money The plans that you make for retirement the way you raise your kids the way you love your spouse when he or she Offends you the way that you pursue friendships in the church. Is there anything in your life that you can point to and say? There there there is an in breaking of new creation Friends jesus died for you. He rose from you so that you might be free now to live not for yourself but for him There's a way that that might sound like bad news Right, like okay. I get eternal life. That's good. But now I have to live for jesus. I can't live for myself anymore But friends this new life is real life Right the other thing right the thing you see when you take the gospel glasses off the thing that everyone else out there Sees every day. It's not real life Right that the pleasures of sin the accumulation of wealth right the hoarding of of fame It doesn't satisfy it doesn't bring anything here Jesus has died for you and rose for you so that you would be free inoculated against that disease So that you might live for him The second implication of jesus's death for us is that we are now reconciled to god You see that there in verse 18 the beginning of verse 19 paul says all this is from god Who through christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation That is in christ. God was reconciling the world to himself Not counting their trespasses against them So here paul gives us another perspective on salvation and that is god is at work through christ to reconcile us to himself Right imagine that a powerful and good king rules over his land with with justice and kindness Right and then imagine That the subjects of this king rebel against him They try to throw off his rule. They try to take his kingdom for themselves Right, that's a that's a fairly accurate picture of our relationship to god Right. We've each tried to live for ourselves rather than for god. We've tried to be the king Rather than the loyal subject and so we are as any subject in our state would be we are estranged from him Right. We've declared on the record our enmity against him We have provoked his opposition to us But what paul's telling us here is that god the great king in his great love and mercy was not content With that state of affairs. He wasn't content to simply condemn us for our treachery Instead paul tells us here through christ God this great king that we've offended is reconciling us to himself He's taken away our guilt by making jesus sin for us at the cross He no longer counts our trespasses against us He's given us a good standing sort of legal citizenship Documents by giving us the righteousness of jesus as a gift And he's changed our hearts by making us a new creation. We no longer harbor a suicidal urge to rebel against him But now we joyfully live as subjects of his kingdom That's what paul is saying that god has done here he has reconciled us to himself That's how paul understands his commission his ministry from the lord Remember from the outset paul's goal here is to get the corinthian church to see the legitimacy of his ministry And he says here in light of god's reconciling work in christ there in verse 18 He has been given a ministry of reconciliation Right he like an ambassador He says has been entrusted with the message of what god has done to reconcile us to himself In verse 20, he says he's like an ambassador From the great king right from the king that we have offended the king who has done everything necessary for us To be reconciled to him right in the same way that an ambassador goes And he speaks on behalf of the government that sent him or her So paul says god is speaking through him. God is making his appeal through paul and through his ministry team Calling people to be reconciled to god And friends that appeal Is echoing down through the centuries to us today You see there at the end of verse 20 paul says we implore you on behalf of christ as his authorized Christ as his authorized representatives We implore you we plead with you What? be reconciled to god Friend it is no small thing That you are able to hear god speak to you through this letter this morning This is nothing less than a royal summons Your creator your god your king is calling you to be reconciled to him There in chapter 6 verse 1 Paul pleads with his readers not to receive the grace of god in vain not to miss This opportunity to take hold of all that god is offering in christ There in verse 2 he drives home the urgency of this appeal with a reference to the words of the prophet isaiah many centuries earlier It says therefore he says and then he quotes isaiah In a favorable time. I listen to you and in a day of salvation. I have helped you And then paul applies it to our circumstance behold Now is the favorable time now Is the day of salvation? Friend if you have not yet received the grace of god in christ If you have not yet laid down arms and grabbed hold of this gracious offer of reconciliation from god Right this offer that god makes to you through the death and resurrection of his son Now is the time Today is the day that salvation is held out to you. You aren't promised tomorrow You aren't promised that you'll ever hear this message again Turn from your sin today And put your trust in christ take hold of the salvation that god is offering you If you have questions about what that means, I would urge you not to delay You can talk to the person who invited you this morning. You can talk to anybody you've seen up here You can talk to me after the service we would be delighted in some small way to serve as god's ambassadors Right to tell you more About the reconciliation that he has achieved in jesus And for those of us who are followers of christ I think one of the best ways we can Apply this passage and embrace the truth of this passage is by celebrating the lord's supper together All right, let's return to the image I mentioned a moment ago of a great king A great and just king who is reconciling rebels to himself Right through the sacrifice of his son. This king has made it possible for us to be restored to our to our proper place to be considered loyal subjects to be in his good graces To enjoy all the privileges that come with being under his rule And now the king has instituted a feast to remember And to celebrate what has transpired And all that that means for us Friends, that's the lord's supper Here we are invited to come and to remember the body of christ broken for us pictured for us in the bread To remember the blood of christ shed for us pictured in the cup And we come And we commune with the lord. Jesus the one who was made sin for us on the cross and who was raised for our salvation We come and we enjoy our status as reconciled subjects It strikes me that this is one of the ways that we live for him Remember there in verse 15 So that we might no longer live for ourselves, but for him who for our sake died and was raised This is one of the ways we take hold of the day of salvation We come to the table and we make this the organizing principle of our week We proclaim our faith in jesus. We we get our our gospel glasses polished and and clarified a little bit So that when we go out into the world, we see that this is the reality that controls us That this is the love that that shapes everything that we do and love and say We're reminded here that the one Who became sin for us so that we might be the righteousness of god is pleased to invite us to his table Now a few things before we celebrate The invitation to come to the table is Is for people who have in paul's words been reconciled to god through faith in jesus So if you're a follower of christ, so if you're not a follower of christ rather right if you haven't Received that that salvation if you haven't taken hold of that offer of reconciliation if you haven't turned to christ in faith We'd ask you not to participate in this part of our service in terms of coming forward to take the bread and cup Right ultimately that would be a celebration of something that it's not yet true of you Instead you could just stay where you are. No one's going to make a big deal. No one's going to stare at you We'd encourage you to take time to think To to ponder the offer the call that god has has made to you this morning to be reconciled to him through the gift of his son And if you are a follower of christ, but you're not a member of this particular local church We believe that the lord's supper is for all those who have repented of their sins and put their trust in christ And so if you've demonstrated that by obeying christ's command to be baptized And if you're connected in membership to another church that preaches the same gospel You've heard this morning and you're allowed to take the lord's supper there We'd be delighted if you participated with us this morning We believe we have great unity with every church that proclaims the gospel of the lord. Jesus The apostle paul does caution the church at corinth in his first letter To examine themselves before they come to the table And so we're going to take a minute now to do just that we'll have a moment of of silent reflection And confession of sin and then i'm going to lead us in a corporate confession of sin And then we'll celebrate the lord's supper together. Let's pray
