Welcome back to the Faith Forward podcast, John Ackerman, Brian Bales, and this is the first week of the second half of a six week total series on being giveaway people and better together. And we're kicking off better together today. But before we say anything about that, this is episode 98. We've been talking about a hundredth episode full of your stories of what God is doing in your life. And again, it's not about compliments for the podcast. It's what's God doing in your life as someone who is trying to take their faith forward. So three minute video, send it to us about what God's doing in your life. Three minute audio recording. If you don't want your face on the podcast, what's God doing in your life? Three minute long email or something that we can try to read in three minutes of what God is doing in your life. Please, please, please. It would, this is a very selfish request. It would bring me so much joy to be able to share those stories. And so far we have two. We've had two submissions so far. So Ginny and Elam, thank you so much for sending those in. And I would just, I would love to share as many stories as you all are willing to have be shared. So if you can get those in by February 4th, in an ideal world, February 7th is the last minute date because even though the podcast comes out on February 11th, it does not get produced on February 11th. No, it does not. So and if, if now is not the time to share stories, then that's okay too. There's no rule that says things have to come on fives and tens. So we may do a hundred and seventh episode if that's when the stories come in. Here's the thing. I know I'm already squirreling and we haven't even got to our topic of the day. You know, it's, it, this is not a guilt statement at all. It's always the time to tell a story. It's always because how the gospel is transforming us to the power of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit in our life is something to share. And in fact, not this particular podcast message, but the next one that we're going to talk about, we're going to talk about the importance of inside a biblical community, what it looks like to share a story. And so just a little bit of a heads up that's coming and what might happen next podcast, you may go, Oh, I've had this story that I really should share with the community that what God's doing, um, that's coming. So you know, then you only have a week to do that. So I'm just sort of prepping you in that way. Yep. And I'm always a last minute person, so I totally get the last minute approach. So with whatever you decide to end up doing, thank you for being a part of this community, this platform, and for being people that want to take their faith forward in practical ways. So with that said, today's topic, Better Together, the beginning of a three week series where we're highlighting the importance of this word community that has almost become so ubiquitous that we've lost track of the definition or how we can enter into it. So Brian, you're kicking off this series this Sunday, um, and we're breaking down this idea of being known in community, of our story being known, of our story being shown in community, and then us being grown in community. So talk a little bit about where we're going on Sunday. Well, if you're, for some reason or another, you're just catching the message on Sunday and you didn't see the earlier part of this series, I felt like a little bit, our explanation up front was like explaining the tax code, a little complicated. But the idea of this series named Next Chapter is around this question that we often get at Christian Fellowship Church, what's next? Like what's the hill God's calling us to climb? Where's he inspiring us? And I felt like it was important to talk about what's next because sometimes when we ask the question next, we look for very concrete things like, are we going to build a building? Are we going to start this program? And by the way, all of those are good and those are great. And those might be things that God has for us in the future. But what's next right now is with the help of the Holy Spirit to become the people that he wants us to be in order for us to be indispensable to the community. And in this series, what we've identified are two particular things that we need to become in order to step towards what God has. So that first half of this series called Next Chapter, the first three weeks was give away people. Now we're into the second half and that is we need to be better together and better together has a lot to do around this word community and community is I'll talk a little bit more next week is a word that's often misunderstood. We actually have a paper here at CFC. If you ever want to grab it or get available to it, you can just email it to us, CFC route. We'll email it to you. If you email to us, faithforwardatcfcyard.org, while you're at it, send us a story, a little plug. But one of the things that, that when we're talking in this context of community is we're not talking about a demographic or geographic area. That is a very good way to talk about community. In fact, we do talk about community through the geographic or demographic lens here at Christian Fellowship Church. But in this series, when we're talking about community, we're talking more about an experiential thing where you're experiencing community. And so what I did was I sort of launched this series from Acts chapter two verse 42 to 47. If you've been familiar in a church at some point, almost every church talks about that because it's the early church and it describes how great the early church is. And John, the truth is whenever I engage someone who hears a message about that or whether they read this section, I've never met one person who has said to me, I don't want that. I don't want, because it is amazing. It's a beautiful picture of what it looks like to experience and live in community. Be together where your story is known, shown, and grown in the context of biblical love. It's phenomenal. I spent some time, again, go back to the message and listen if you haven't heard already, talking about how much in that culture in that time, that culture in that time made it a little easier because of the tools and how it worked for that to occur. But there still needed to be some effort. And then what I then just fleshed through is that in our culture, in our time, for lots of reasons, it is not as easy to do that. But just because it's not as easy doesn't mean that we shouldn't do it. And one of the unique things is, is that we do see this correlation or connection between the importance that we put on something and whether or not we'll find a way. We just do. I mean, if we need to put something or hang something up and we see it's real important, we can't find a hammer, we use a shoe, right? And I think lots of times, because in our culture and in our time, it's more difficult to find a way to be in community, to have that experience. Many times we answer that question, we don't want to be it because we are passive about it and we don't know what to do. And so what this three weeks has been about, and those have been a bit verbose on my part, but I want to just make sure I reinforce what I said on Sunday, or if you listen to this before you listen to Sunday to make sure you don't miss this, is that we had in the series that we did on Nehemiah, we talked about the value of community. What this part is, being better together in community, is a lot about how to actually do it in light of the culture that we're in and the things. And the one thing that I made that we're going to talk a point I made that we're going to talk a lot about today is that if we want to be known in the context of biblical love, it has to be an active choice instead of a passive choice to be found. We just don't, it might happen in rare occasions, but that's the exception, not the rule. And if all of us are living like we're the exception and not the rule, that's a problem. We've got to be active in finding that community. I know it's scary. I know there's lots of reasons sometimes we don't, and there's over the next couple of weeks, we're going to talk about some of those, but today we're going to talk about making an active choice, what it looks like, and really give some, hopefully some insightful help to take your faith forward about when you make that active choice, how do I make a wise active choice? Because I didn't spend a whole lot of time on Sunday going, well, this is how you do it wisely. I said, this is what you need to do. And so there's lots of analogies where you can say, okay, well, I don't know how to, you know, go out and hunt for food. Well, I hand you a weapon, right? I'm telling you, this is how you do it. But there's not a lot of, you need some safety courses and some stuff. And so think of it through that analogy. Sunday was, hey, here's what you need to do to go, here's what you need to do to have community. Here's your weapon. I don't know if the analogy is good. We're talking a little bit about how to use it. Yeah. And so as always, the goal here is practicality. How do I take the importance of what was talked about on Sunday, the significance, the legitimacy of it, and put it into practical effect. And as you were talking about this one, that it's an active choice to find instead of a passive choice to be found, one of the things that I was thinking about was you also referenced, this isn't about introvert, extrovert. This isn't about temperament. This isn't about, there is a right version of, you know, a person to do this and a wrong version is because it's also recognizing that for every type of person, their version of active would probably mean ramping up a bit from what their normal is. And for high achieving, over-functioning people, telling them to ramp up further may actually be problematic. Yeah. But for people that have been, you know, hedging more on the side of, well, I'm just going to wait for somebody to walk up to me at church and say, hey, we've got a group of people and we've been watching you for the last 12 weeks and we think you'd be a great fit. Would you like to join us that there's maybe a nudge in the direction of maybe I start initiating conversations or maybe I just start looking around at who could be my people. And so it's not that everybody has to work harder. It's take stock of how you're pursuing community and see if it's working. You know, that's a really good clarification. People if you've been listening to this before, you know that John and I actually record this before I speak on Sunday. And I actually wish I would have heard John say that already before. And so now I'm going to retrofit a little bit of what I'm going to say in the sunny. And when I say make an active choice, I'm probably then going to make a little parentheses because I think maybe a more clear term would be make a strategic choice because that's what I meant. Be proactive. And the assumption behind that nature is to be strategic, but we're not always strategic. And that's really kind of what we're talking about, how to strategically do it. Yeah. And so part of what was driving these thoughts for me was, um, I was recently having, it was last week having a conversation with one of my closest friends and we've been friends now for about a decade. And over that decade, we have frequently had the conversation of, I wonder if we would have become friends if we knew each other when, ah, yes. And you know, Kathy and I, my wife have had that conversation of would we have gotten married if we knew each other in our early twenties. And we've answered that with no, no. So definitely glad it went into the late twenties. Right. And, and as part of that conversation, we were also talking about the context in which our friendship started, which was at the beginning of a group. It was the first group that I had ever led. I was barely into my thirties and most everybody else in that group was five to 10 years younger than me. And ostensibly Brooke and I were supposed to be leading that group. But what ended up happening was that we all became close friends. And over the years, as that group morphed and people were added and people left and we've had to wrestle with the tension of how did we find each other in the first place? Is that replicable? And as we continue to find the patterns and connections of our relationships change over the years, how do we maintain the connection we have and build new healthy ones? And we were having this conversation of this is way more like dating than I want it to be as someone who thought I was done with dating because I'm now happily married. Yeah. It was making me realize that as I am committed to the idea of finding transformational relationships, which is how we're talking about community, places where I am deeply known and where I am able to deeply know others. And the result of us all being deeply known is that we're experiencing significant growth. That some of the things that I used to look for in relationships, whether friendships or romantic relationships when I was dating, aren't nearly as important as I thought they were. When I was first dating or first looking for friends, I really thought common interests was like the most important thing. Did we like the same movies? Did we like the same sports or sports teams? Did we read the same books? Did we like the same music? And it's not that those things are unimportant. It's just they're not as important as I thought they were at the time to cultivate the kinds of relationships that I now realize I want to cultivate. Right. Similarly, I used to think that having common views, and what I mean by that is common outlooks on the political arena, the social arena, you know, the way I think about the world and the people in it, not purely from a secular standpoint, but from a philosophical standpoint. I used to think that was pretty critical, and I've come to realize that I have some incredibly close friends, and we diverge in some cases fairly significantly on some of those philosophical viewpoints, the way that we view different things in and around the world. And I'm not talking through the lens of the scriptures. We're not at theology yet, so don't hear that, but we're just talking about philosophies on life. I found those to be only marginally helpful in creating transformational relationships, and in some cases, the divergence is what's most helpful in creating transformational growth in me, is I need people that think differently, not people that think the same in some important ways. I've also come to realize that common passion is far more helpful than I thought, and what I mean by that is common mission, common areas of passion where I am willing to throw myself and my energy and my thoughts and my resources into the fight, where I'm willing to invest them. And finding people that have a similar passion, a similar area of not just interest, but investment, has done a whole lot more because that's a place where we can grow together. But the thing I found most helpful, more than common interest, more than common views, more than common passion, is common commitment. What I mean by that is a commitment to genuine love. We talked about known, grown, and shown in the context of biblical love. And that's not just, here's what I believe to be true, but biblical love, at least one of the ways that I'm thinking about it, is sacrificial, and common commitment in the way that it's a common commitment to a way of life with God. That's not so much adherence to doctrinal principles as it is a commitment to walk with God, dynamically, transformationally, that it's a commitment to find the people that want a transformational relationship with God and with each other. If you find those people, that'll change your life. You said a lot there. I think there's a few things that, as you're listening, I would want to draw your attention to. What John is laying out for you are not things to check box. They are principles that guide us on this. And when I, for example, have talked to young adults before they start to date, one of the things that I often invite them into doing is creating a set of principles, not a check box, that they feel like this is important and why. What John is doing for you here is giving you your own sort of set of principles, not things, to help you so you don't have to go out and find it about this common interest, common views, common passion, but more important, common commitment. I say this when people, if you don't know this already, the source of this podcast comes from Christian Fellowship Church in Ashburn, Virginia, so lots of times you'll find John and I here on a Sunday where our typical services are, and I have the privilege many times of meeting people who are on the search, whether they express it this way or not, for relationship and community through the expression of the church. And one of the things I tell them, I say, it's hard finding a church, finding community, because just because a church fits a couple things doesn't mean it's right. And I use the illustration, just because someone loves Jesus and you find them pretty doesn't mean you should marry them. And community in some ways isn't the same level of commitment as marriage, but it is a commitment. And so I think a lot of times what happens is that we fail to have these principles to help guide us, and what we do is we hop in and we think relationally someone's pretty, we think relationally this person or that person loves Jesus, and we have some things that are common, but maybe not as helpful, and we dive into this, and it doesn't, I don't want to say it goes off the rails, it can, but it just doesn't go in the way that we think it should. It could result in a less than a positive experience just in it being something that was somewhat vanilla or bland, or in some cases it can actually wind up in a significant experience where someone finds themselves being hurt. It happens, and what can really easily occur then is we begin to do the old baby and bath water problem. We begin to say, oh, the problem was community doesn't work. No. We said this in the last series where we talked about Better Together, but we also said it in the fall when we talked about retuning. Nowhere in scripture will you find this statement, be in community. Once in scripture, community was already there. It was implied. Scripture talks about how to live in community, but we live now in a time where we don't live in community, so we've got to understand that scripture, through things like, for example, 35 times I mentioned on Sunday, there are statements like one another, commands. You can't be one another unless you're living with one another in community. Fourteen times the statement of the 35, so not 14 of the 35, but the one statement, love one another, is repeated 14 times in scripture, which is why you see us say in the context of biblical love. That is when we talk about common commitment to genuine love, because when we are commonly committed to genuine love, when we're commonly committed to the sacrificial love, that's why in some ways we started with giveaway people. We talked about Luke chapter 10. We talked about Matthew chapter 22. Love your neighbor as yourself. When it's there, then that's when it really becomes, because it's not if you hit bumps in the road. I mean, you mentioned friends that are your people. How can you not hit some bumps in the road when there's differences? I know my people. How can I not hit bumps in the road? I'll say this. Probably, I don't think I've ever said this to you personally. Let's just say it on podcast. Probably, John is, if I talk about overlaps of similarities of friends, he's probably wired more like me than anyone that I can think of, but that is not what makes us friends. That is not, in fact, that can be a big mistake when all we're looking for are people who look like us, walk like us, talk like us. When we have unity that way, and I'm going to preach a different sermon, there's nothing Christian about that. The world can do that. When John chapter 17 calls us to live in unity, Jesus is in the upper room and he's talking to disciples that one of them wanted to overthrow the government and the other one worked for the government. I mean, if you think about that, Matthew Levi was a tax collector and Simon the zealot was out there trying to overthrow Rome. He's like, love each other. And when that happens, when we're doing this in the context of biblical love, not only to help us know our story and show our story, it grows our story. We'll talk about that. But also it is a testimony of the truth of the gospel to the world around us. I digress again, but there you go. That wasn't digressing. That was very helpful. And you had mentioned, I think, I think you're going to mention, I always love having to say it this way. Well, because you've got two sermons in your head that have sent you and you always never know exactly because I'm the same way. I think you're going to say this Sunday, the reference to Proverbs 17, 17, that a friend loves at all times and a brother is born for adversity. And that was one of those things that when I read it in your message, I remembered that I had read it before because it felt like I'd forgotten it and was hearing it again for the first time. And that twofold aspect of the love focus of friendship, the fierce commitment to support and encourage. But what we often think we desire is the comfort and ease of sameness, the comfort and ease of lack of tension, the comfort and ease of, man, this is just a smooth road. And that's not actually what transformational community looks like. It looks a lot like Jesus in the 12 of these guys are either going to kill each other or change the world. And we're going to have to wait and see how this works out. And I just want to pause on that, right? They were strategically put in a group by Jesus and he was perfect following the Holy Spirit and the guide. And there was no mistake in the compilation of these groups, because sometimes I think we can look at groups of people together and like, oh, well, that just happened by some sort of accident. Right? No, Jesus picked them specifically. So not only did he know something that they could and would do if they submitted to him, but they also know something that what happened and they could show the world if they submitted to the Holy Spirit. Yeah. And to the extent at the beginning that he had knowledge intimately of the end, he entered into relationship with those 12, knowing that at some point all 12 of them are going to leave. Right? He's setting himself up for heartache, for the goodness that comes in the transformational crucible of community. And if we're not willing to do that, we're not going to get to that place of true transformation. We're just going to have good friends that we hang out with and talk about the interests and enjoy the fact that we have common views. And we're going to miss that place of genuine transformation. You reminded me of a time in my life. Well, I've been married 23 years in March. Almost messed it up. My wife's birthday's in April. Hi, Kathy. Hi, Kathy. But pre that, so we're talking like 25 years ago, before we even met, I had a group of guys that I spent significant time with. We'd go to lunch together with that sort of stuff. And it just sort of happened. But here's what I realized. Without being strategic at that point in our life, almost every conversation could happen around two things, sports and who were we interested in, who was interested in us. Those were easy, low hanging fruit. And those aren't bad questions and those aren't bad conversations. But I had this moment one time. It really was. I would like to say in retrospect, the Holy Spirit told me this, like try not talking about those things. Yeah. And so it was interesting. I had to make a concerted effort. And I think it was like two months of us meeting where I never walked in and went, hey, I'm not talking about that. But like when someone like I, instead of engaging, I'm like, oh, and I would try to do this or try to do that. And what I realized is, is when we all started picking up on that, the conversations went deeper. It was a strategic choice in some ways. And so you may have to hear what I'm saying in this. You may have to go out and make a strategic choice to find your community. You may already have a community, but your strategic choice looks like, how do I change the tenor of our interactions? So it may be right there already. You might not be aware of it, or you just may be experiencing it at a level of, hey, we're hanging out, but not where Jesus wants to go. So just know it looks that way a little bit differently. And so we come to the first place where we say, ask God. And ask God in a few ways. So like you said, if you already have your people, ask God about how to take those connections to places where deeper transformation occurs. What are the shifts? What are the changes? What are the additions? And again, it's not that you have to just wholesale discharge everything else you've ever done that brought you together in the first place. But it's what can be added to take this deeper, to take this further, to challenge us to grow in ways that are potentially uncomfortable. Again, we're either going to kill each other or we're going to change the world. Let's see what happens. And if you haven't yet found your people, this is now not the invitation for you to go find your people on your own through your filters. Going back to my conversation with my friend of 10 years, would we have wanted to be friends then? And the people that came into this circle when we first started that we probably wouldn't picked, but God seemed to bring together. And we discovered that the collective benefit of that group brought something that we would have missed out on had we gone the route of homogeneity, had we gone the route of let's just find the people that are like us and that we're comfortable with. So the next topic, and Brian, I'm going to throw this to you first. Once you find like-hearted people, you must continue to make active choices to be known. So what are some practical things that help us once we've found our people or once we're trying to take the people we've found further? What are some helpful things to do? Okay, so some practical steps. One of the things that you just mentioned that highlighted before I talk about this practical step of just you can't fake showing up is that when you start bumping into, maybe you've stepped into this community and things aren't going in a way that you might have expected attention. The question isn't, should I run or should I stop showing up? The question is, did God call me into here? That's why you got to ask God first. We got to walk through those principles, continue walking the step of the spirit, knowing what he's asking you to do, because we're going to hit that. And recently I was in, I'm in a group and I was talking to someone who's in the group and they were thinking about stepping away. And just my question to them was, okay, that's fine. But why? And you know, what they discovered was, is there were some things not happening in the way that they pre-perceived. And I said, okay, great. The next question is go back and ask God, does God want you? Because maybe God's doing something. And so if you don't ask God when you hit those moments or whatever it might be, or even before you hit this moment, so what'll happen is we will fake showing up. All right. And I heard this years ago from actually someone who came in and spoke to the men's ministry at Christian Fellowship Church. Just love the line and used it as like, at the minimum, you can't fake showing up. You got to be present. You'd be present for the gatherings, you there, but okay, you got, I'm going to say this differently. You have to attend whatever that is. You have to attend and you've got to make it a priority because again, this doesn't happen by accident. And I hear people say this all the time. I don't have time. I don't have time. I don't have time. I completely understand what it looks like to have a very busy outlet calendar. But I also want to know and want to say this as graciously as I can say this. We all have time for what we find to be important. It's just true. We make time for what we've done. We want to read that book. We find time. We want to watch that television show. We find time. We want to go on that vacation. We want to go. None of those are bad, but I've never really met someone who doesn't find time to do something that they value, even if it's a small amount of time. So you can't fake showing up. That's the first thing. You've got to attend. But when you're there, you also have to be there. You have to be present. Attendance isn't enough. And so in my own marriage, my wife called me out on this years ago and she was correct. I didn't like it at the time, but she was correct. She would say this, you know, she'd say, Brian, you are here, but you're not present. That's what she's saying. Your body is in attendance at this family gathering, but your mind is somewhere else. And so when you engage in that communal experience, when whatever may, you need to make a commitment, whatever it looks like to attend, but also to be present. You could have differing temptations depending upon who you are. But I will say this, this thing, this phone thing right here is one of the greatest distractions of being present to anywhere. And what I would suggest, if you are in a gathering of people where you're attempting for that to be your community, when you're known, grown, and shown, put that thing on do not disturb. And if you put it on do not disturb, I don't know if you know this, I don't know anything about an Android. That's like one of the few things John and I have different, he has a really bad taste and approach to phones. But I know on my iPhone is this, is that the people who I know in emergency get through that. They get through some random text that this or that, the other thing they don't come through. So I'm not going to miss something. It's designed that way. You know, God and Steve Jobs made it that way to work. It's not going to be missed. I didn't say God was Steve Jobs, even though he may have thought he was, but that's for a different podcast. Sure, sure. So, all right. Can't fake showing up and being attentive, but you also can't fake showing up like when others begin to need help. I think that's a key aspect of it. I talked, I'm going to actually, I'm going to talk about this. Bear one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ. That's this idea of shown. We'll get a little bit more into this next week, but sometimes we struggle in community. We'll have a wrong idea of what it means to show our story and to bear one another's burdens. And we struggle the most sometimes when we are people who think we should not have to have our burden co-shared. Hold that thought. We'll talk about that, about what Christ means in Galatians next week when he talks about that through the apostle Paul in Galatians. But just know that. You can't fake showing up attendance in group, in experience with other people's needs. You can't fake showing up present when you're there. But also here's something that really happened. I think easy is like I'm here, but now while I'm attending, I am, I like, I use this term putting on a jersey. That's not really who I am, but I'm going to play this role like, you know, for some people they actually are, you know, football players. I was talking on Sonny just how my, my daughter has now become a fan of football, particularly two teams for two specific different reasons. She doesn't necessarily like Kansas city. She just likes seeing Taylor Swift to the Kansas city games. And number two, she doesn't really like Cincinnati as much as she likes Joe Burrow, the quarterback who plays for Cincinnati. It's weird for me as a 17 year, a father of a 17 year old daughter to have that expressed by her, but nonetheless, and the Browns fan, there's a lot about that, but there's a distinct difference between what happens with Joe Burrow does things and what happens when Taylor Swift does things. They both bring views to television, but one's a fan and one actually affects the outcome of the game. When we come in, we put on a jersey and we're faking it. No matter how much we want to say that we're not really playing, we're a fan pretending to be something and that requires sacrifice. That means when you step in, you, you've got to be real. You know, you, uh, you made a comment in our notes here about what it looks like when we fake our competence because, um, I don't, John said this before, I don't like coming in with, and here's all the things that I need. I don't like projecting that even when I don't have it all together, I like to pretend that I do. Yeah. Yeah. I, you know, you talked about Kathy calling you out on, you know, being here, but not present. I was at a conference, um, being hosted by some people that I had learned a lot from during one of the sessions, the guy who was leading it brought up two of his best friends on stage. And again, guys whose relationship is deep and transformational and goes back decades. And two of them talked about sort of the, the critical tipping moment in their relationship was when the one guy turned to the other and said, I need you to know that it's really hard to be your friend because you don't need anything from anyone. And the guy who was on the receiving end of that really had to come to terms with what he thought had been a good way of relating, of always showing up for others and never needing to be shown up for. And what his friend was calling out in that moment was, I don't actually know you because there's no human being on this planet that doesn't need to be shown up for, but you never give us the chance. And so we don't actually know you and we don't actually get to feel close to you. And I was so struck by that at that conference because that's me. And that's been me for most of my life. And most of my life narrative seemed to cement the reality in me of, well, you're all alone and it's all up to you. So why would I invite people in if it's all up to me, right? Every single one of us are going to bring into our community connections, the lessons that life has taught us, both good and distorted. And that's part of what gets worked out in the context of community. The things that we have come to believe are true about ourselves, about others in the world around us. And they encounter the living flesh of other people that force us to reevaluate some of those things. And that can't happen if we don't let them in and it can't happen if we don't get into their life. And I think the insidious nature of that belief is that it feels like when we live that way that we're actually being a good friend. We're being a neighbor as we're called to be in Matthew 22, but we're actually not. And again, we'll dig into this a little bit more, but if you're struggling with this right now and you're like, I don't want to wait to the next podcast, let me just get this out of the way. The command in Galatians chapter five is to bear one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ. But then later on it says, but each man must carry his own burden. Grammatically and in the Greek, just quickly, the word burden used when it says bear one another's burdens, when you have to bear another person's versus each man must carry his own burden. Those are two different words. When it says each man must carry his own burden. It's like it's your own backpack. Everyone's, you know, it doesn't mean you got to be lazy, carry your own backpack. However, when it says bear one another's burdens, it is a command and implicit in that command is that every single one of us in life are given burdens that we cannot carry on our own. It isn't a backpack. This is something that no matter how strong you are emotionally, physically, spiritually, you cannot do it on your own. And so the implicit call to community are those people who you're with are walking along and say, Hey, let me help you carry it. And so when we tell ourselves or we let the enemy tell ourselves that we have to carry everything, we are missing that fine line between our personal responsibility to not be lazy and do those things and the reality of truth in a broken world that we can't carry everything. And so we're actually not living out biblical community. We're not actually living out when we're like, Hey, I got it. And I'm, I'm with you. Like I'm remember when we talked about that, I don't remember if it was on podcast, we talked about off podcast. I was like, Oh, thank God. Thank you, God, for using that person to talk to John, to talk to me because I'm the same way. It's really easy for me to feel I'm being a good friend by not here. I'm not burdening you with my burden, but when we understand this in the concept of biblical love and I'm doing it right, I'm not burdening you with my burden. That's how God designed it to work. Yeah. Too often we misidentify what's the backpack and what's the boulder that we're supposed to team carry. Yeah. Yeah. It's always a backpack. Yeah. As we're like squashed on the ground, like, no, I'm fine. I can walk. I watched Monty Python in the last weekend, so I'm not dead yet, but anyway, that's just a flesh wound. There you go. Um, and so along these lines, there's also this reality, and you talked about this, that you can't project a false self if you really want to be known. And so some of that means there's the necessity, and you talked about this on Sunday, of the vulnerability that comes from confession. Yeah. So that word confession is a loaded word for a lot of people. And so maybe a better word is the vulnerability that comes from openness, the vulnerability that comes from transparency. Because here's the thing I've learned about vulnerability, and if you've come through our square one class, I talk about this in our fourth week, that vulnerability itself is actually selective. That especially when you talk about public figures, you know, you might share a hard moment that you and Kathy had in your marriage, but there's probably 12 others you're not sharing. You've heard me say this. I know you have. I don't say that. Translucent and transparent aren't the same thing. Translucent is when you strategically choose to give someone a view in that doesn't show everything. It's better than not being anything, but that's not what this circle is called for. Yeah. And so if you really want to be known, and if you really want to be transformed, and if you really want the group of people that you have to have a transformational effect on each other, then at some point the facades have to go away. At some point, the selective vulnerability has to turn into transparent vulnerability where you're seen even if you're trying to not be seen. It was one of the greatest things that happened in that group that I talked about that my close friend and I formed 10 years ago is we started off that group by each person getting the entire evening to share the story of their life, not their testimony, the story of their life, two to three hours. When you hear the two to three hour version of someone's life, it becomes so much easier to see them even when they don't want to be seen. You're like, ah, I see. You talked about this. I remember you saying this is a thing that you do, or I see now that this thing and this thing plus this thing in your life is prompting this sort of, I see you. Can I illustrate that? I think some people who maybe have not experienced this see this in abstract. Just recently I was spending time with a particular group. Someone in this group, they were coming to me not as a community, but they're coming to me just, hey, guide me through this a bit, had told part of their story. In part of that story, there was some significant family betrayal that had happened while they were growing up. Now they were having some struggles that the person they were in a relationship with felt like, hey, they didn't trust them because they were always asking different questions. Because the story was real and because of the help and the guidance of the Holy Spirit, we're able to identify this idea that it wasn't that this person in the relationship didn't trust the other person. It's that the story of this person's life that the enemy had told them was, is that their family had missed some things and because their family had missed some things, certain bad things happened and all this pain was occurring. So when this other person in this relationship with someone else kept asking questions, it's not, I don't trust you. It was, I don't want to miss something. I don't want to be hurt later on. And when we're able to take that because of the story and the vulnerability, someone else in this case was in a small group of community of three of us was able to speak in and go, ah, this is what's happening. And I think the vulnerability of confession in this story, when it says, you know, in James chapter five, confess your sins or confess your story to one another and pray for one another that you may be healed. Hear this. Another person doesn't heal you from your issues, but God uses other people to bring about that healing. And that healing is directly related to the knowledge naturally and supernaturally that one has in a relationship so that they can call you into account if they see something. Or in this particular case, as I imagine some cases, if you had sometimes when we know someone's story and we're not like, right. If you're not watching the podcast on YouTube, right, I got my hands right up in my face. Sometimes we're so close to it. We can't see it. We have those other friends around us to go, Hey, you've talked about this, but I don't know if you know, this might be showing up this way here. That's part of what this idea is that you may be healed because those people in your circle, your people, they're committed to biblical love. If we've chosen well in biblical love means, Hey, let me talk to you in this way. And for some of you, we're finally getting to the point that you've been waiting for when we talk about community, which is all right, it's time to help fix other people. This is my jam. This is what I'm passionate about. I'm really good at, in fact, I feel gifted at seeing into people's story from outside of their story and helping them grow. I love you're about to raise this caveat in morning, by the way, it's a good one. Yeah. I love people with that heart and you have to be very, very careful with your own assessment of your maturity in that space. And I'm not saying this as a universal statement, but most people that I have met that have that heart are immature in that space because in most cases, and maybe that's an overstatement in many cases, even a good heart to see change and growth and others. And many times is at least partially motivated by my desire for comfort and to not have to deal with other people who don't have their stuff together as well as I think I do. Yeah. You always have a hammer you're trying to use, even in a good way. You're always trying to find a nail. And in that analogy, it's not saying that a hammer is not good. You said this off podcast, and I wish I could remember exactly how you said it. Just because you know something doesn't mean, do you remember when we were talking about this a couple of minutes ago? How did you say that? Does that ring a bell? Not yet. Just because you know something or you see something in someone's life doesn't mean you're called to say something. Yeah. I think that's really valuable. When iron sharpens iron, that's the verse I use from Proverbs 27, 17, the courage to challenge someone. Yeah. Is it for now or for later or for them? Yes. Explain that really quick. Yeah. So the idea that as I've had to grow in maturity in this because I'm someone that likes to help people. I'm someone that people come to for help is I've had to grow in my awareness of this isn't about my agenda and my priorities and oh, I see that I'll fix that for you. Let me just tell you and then you'll know and then you'll change. It's the awareness with God, right? We talked about being known, shown and grown in the context of biblical love. That's not in the context of the biblical hammer of here's truth, deal with it. And there is a time for a hammer. There is. Yeah. But it's in the context of biblical love. And so often I have been forced to confront the pace at which God chooses to work versus the pace at which I think God should choose to work in the lives of others. And so often I've had to learn to ask the question, if I'm seeing something in someone else's story, in someone else's life, ask God, is this something for now or for later? Is this something for me to share now? Or is this something for me to see but hold on to? Or is this something for me to just know about them and you're going to talk to them about it? It's going to come from me. But when I see them making the shift, I'm going to recognize it because you clued me in on it. Yeah. Yeah. That is one of the most difficult parts about this last aspect that you mentioned on Sunday about the courage to challenge. It's not the courage to hit people with the hammer because for some people that requires very little courage. In many cases, it's the courage to not hit people with the hammer. It's the courage, like with Job's friends, to not start talking about what you think you know, but to sit with your friend until God starts talking about what God knows. And one of the things I think that often gets misunderstood of that Job story is they were well-intentioned. Yeah. I mean, they were wrong. You can be well-intentionally wrong, but you're not well-intentioned. You're not ill-intentioned to go and to sit with someone for seven days just to say what you want to say. Absolutely. I mean, they were well-intentioned, but what they didn't do is they didn't engage God in this process. And it is the danger, you know, of making sure that we are aligned with God's heart, especially when we're challenging someone that God asks us to do from time to time. God, is this true, number one, and then is this for now? Is it for later? Is it for you? You know, whatever it might be. I didn't say that last part right, but you know what I meant. We can. We can say, oh, I've temptation this before all the time. Well, I've seen this before, so it must be this. Yeah. See this one. Not always. No. Not always. And so, you know, stay in there. But don't, part of this too is I think some people feel like I'm not really a friend if I challenge you. Yeah. If actually, you know, going back to a friend loves adversity. Yeah. Another proverb is the wounds of a friend are better than the kisses of an enemy. That isn't a proverb saying wound your friend. Here we go. Right? That's not what that's calling. It's saying if you are choosing, that is better. Yeah. Right. That is better. Yeah. And so a great deal of this courage to challenge has to be rooted in having had the courage to be challenged, right? The truisms and the truth of you can't give what you don't have. You can't leave people where you haven't been. And again, that's part of the immaturity that I saw in myself and that I've seen in others who are willing to challenge but are unwilling to be challenged. A story I want to tell, but I'll share it for another time. But it really is the truth of what Jesus talks about in Matthew 7 with the log and the speck. Right? And sometimes we've taken even that parable to extremes of, well, that means you're never supposed to challenge anybody because we all have our own log. And that's not the way that Jesus talks about it. He does say, first deal with the log in your eye and then, right? There is an and then. And so sometimes we go, well, I chipped off a few shavings of my log. So I'm at the and then part now. Or some people say, well, I have to deal with the entirety of my log before I can. And that part is a little unclear in the timing of it. But there is a significant emphasis on if you want to challenge others, you go first. Yeah. Another, what I would like to say, cousin of that is when we misunderstand the section of scripture says, judge not lest you be judged. That isn't saying that you aren't to be people who are coming to someone's life and challenge him through. I see this. That seems that it means the manner that the full contact, the manner to which you approach it is the manner that you're also inviting for God to approach you. So that requires humility. That requires grace. So when someone picks up a hammer for every nail, is that really how we want God to come at us? And the answer to that is no. It's not inviting us not to say something. It's to consider it proportionally to how we want to. And by the way, that's why that verse, if we understand it properly, connects with this idea. Love your neighbor as yourself. Love your neighbor in the way that you want to be loved. So here's a super practical one that you're probably not going to like, but I'm going to say it anyway. If you want to turn your community into a transformational community, go first. Ask the question of others. Are there areas in my life where you think I could grow? Do you see areas in my life where I maybe need to invite God in? Set the example and don't do it as, all right, well then here's how I get it. All right. So you just told me that. All right. So now my turn. Sit back because I have a list. Get some popcorn. Take that feedback and then go do it. Take that response from your community and go live it for a little while and let them see you live it. Let them see that your heart is for growth, not for their change. Go first. That's hard. But that's when we see the kind of transformation begin to occur with the people that we have committed to walking with. There's probably more we could say. I was just about to say, I feel like we could talk for a good long time. There's just still so much. And so I think that's a reminder though, that this is always a process. We could talk for forever. But I would say this, the one thing I would encourage is the real way to take your faith forward is not just to hear what we say, but hear what God says and then not just hear what God says, but then actually step into what God asks. So as always, happy to continue the conversation, shoot us an email, faithforwardatcfcyr.org. And this can be part of the story too. The stories you send in don't have to be stories of completion because all of our stories are stories of process. So until next time, when we talk about this some more, he's Brian and I'm John, we'll see you later.
