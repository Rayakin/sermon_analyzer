Welcome back to the Faith Forward podcast, John Ackerman, and joining me today is Lee Towns, who, if you've been accessing us virtually in other places as well, I was going to say, you may have seen his face, but that's probably not the case. You might've heard his voice, but that might not be true either, but maybe you'll recognize his words as they match up with his keystrokes. So however you've engaged in, this is Lee Towns, our pastor of story and digital ministry. Lee, thanks for joining today. Thanks, John. I'm glad to be here. It's a privilege both to do the ministry that I do, which does sometimes have voice and face, but it's also a privilege to be a part of this today. So hey, thank you. Yeah, absolutely. So as is often the case, I know new year, especially sometimes people are starting new things. And so if you're just joining the Faith Forward podcast, our goal is always to make this practical. So we'll take the Sunday message and then we'll make it personal. We'll talk a little bit about what this has looked like in our lives, and we'll hopefully offer what's intended to be helpful suggestions on how we take our faith forward. Hence the name. We didn't get super clever with it. Just tried to stay on the nose. So we're in the second week on this series that we started this year called Alien Living. And so Lee, you had the privilege of preaching this Sunday morning, the second week in this series. And so as we often do, we always ask that you actually watch the Sunday message first. This is not meant to replace the Sunday message. This is supplementary. This is a bonus. This is an add on. But we also recognize that sometimes people just get to this first and then they get to the message. So Lee, would you want to give us a couple minutes summary of what you said? And again, everybody knows we record this early, so tell us what you pretty sure you're going to say on Sunday morning. Well, I'm pretty sure I'm going to say, in fact, I know I'm going to say, be holy, pursue holy. Uh, I'm going to, I'm going to say that. I hope so much that, uh, you walk out saying, be holy, pursue holy, uh, as I looked at this passage and, uh, this letter from the apostle Peter, uh, the passage in the, in the first chapter that just, it just jumped out at me that, that this lays actually the foundation for the rest of the letter, be holy, pursue holy, be holy, pursue holy. This is what I want you to do. Be holy, pursue holy. We're going to talk about both aspects of that statement, uh, in the course of the message, or if you're watching this after the message, we talked about that. And, um, and, and the idea is this, that, that holiness one is this giant word and theme, uh, in the church. Uh, in fact, as I was preparing for the message and knew this was my task was to talk about holiness. I thought, man, I know preachers that have spent a lifetime preaching on this issue. I mean, it's just massive. And yet at the same time, it's, it's a funny word. It's one of those words that we say, be holy. And then when you say define that, it's a, it's a really different response. And, and so we talk about this concept and assume we understand the concept and, and really it's about who we are. It's about who God makes us to be as he works in us. And it's really about who God is. And, and it's not about what we do so much as it is who we are and who he is and how we live in light of that. And so when we talk about being holy, which is the really important aspect of that, because that's what God has said, be holy. That's right out of his words. When, when that gets understood, then the pursue holy is actually just a logical outcome of being holy. That there's a manifestation of our being holy as we pursue that in our life. So that's an essence. So pretty simple, really. Oh yeah. Super simple. So like you said, I mean, this is obviously a lifetime process, not only to understand, but to become. And so we're not claiming that in this series on alien living and living a holy life, or in this one particular episode of the podcast on holy living that we're covering all the bases, which by the way, this has nothing to do with the content of the message or the podcast. But if you saw the message, uh, it is my sick and twisted sense of humor that brought the alien to alien living. If you saw the message, you know what I'm talking about? If you didn't see the message, you just got exposed. Right. Right. But again, people watch this second. So you'll go, you'll catch the Easter egg. It'll be good. There you go. Yeah. Yeah. So as always, the goal is to get practical here. And so Leah, as we're talking about some of the elements that your message touches on and, and the invitation to, to be holy, this process of becoming, and that this process of becoming holy has some results, has some natural consequences. And one of the things that you said, or you're planning on saying, it's always the best part of doing this early. Um, that holiness is actually the result of our affection. Yeah. Yeah. And to say it another way, we become like what we love. And so in, in the interest of being practical, one of the first places to begin, if we truly want to enter into this journey of holiness, of becoming holy and living holy, it has to do with affection. It has to do with love. And so very practically, how do you, how do I, how do we grow in this area of our affection? How do we, how do we cultivate our level of affection towards God? How do we nurture that? And at the same time, how do we become aware of God's level of affection for us? Yeah. You know, one of the things about affection, and particularly when we don't use the affection word, but we use love, we've been sold the fairytale, um, that love just happens, you know? And so it just, it lands on us one day, kind of like raindrops falling from the sky, you know? And, but the truth of the matter is we really have a lot of control over our affection and we influence our affection. And, and it's difficult for me to talk about being holy without going back to the affection part. In fact, in the first portion, we, you know, my, my portion of text was verses 13 and following, but in verse eight, which is kind of laying the groundwork for the whole book, he says, you love him though you have never seen him. And though you do not see him now, you trust him. And this causes you to rejoice with glorious, inexpressible joy that, that, that love then creates this movement. And, and how we control that, you know, in very practical ways is, you know, in the same way that I'm going to control how I, how I experienced love with my wife, you know, and, and at least for me, I'm going to spend time with God. Uh, and, and that time with God, you know, uh, this could be a podcast all by itself, but that time with God can't just be a to-do list, you know, it's a being in his presence, not a doing in front of him or, you know, and, and I, you know, part of, uh, my research and my reading in, you know, my preparation for the message took me to A.W. Tozer's classic work, um, Pursuit of the Holy. And, and in it, he talked about the idea of not being satisfied with merely being saved, not being satisfied with just the transaction. Here I went, I did what I was supposed to do, but instead leaning into and pursuing and spending time in the presence of God. And so my time with God cultivates that. Now, how I organize my time with God, the contents of my time with God, that's critical. I, I have been a guy that has, uh, often done the analysis, uh, so to speak of, of my life, you know, uh, I'll look back at an event and I'll debrief it, you know, internally, or I'll look back at a season and I'll debrief it. And a part of what happens for me when I do that, when I'm, you know, whether it's literally debriefing with a pen and paper, or it's just thinking back through is I am thinking back through the places where I've seen God involved in my life and where I've seen grace. And I think in a little later in this conversation, we're going to be able to talk about grace and the role of grace in holiness, but, but where I've seen grace and grace is the purest expression of love. And so where I see God's grace in my life, I'm seeing God love me. And so, you know, and which is what Peter does in the letters. He starts with here, let's, let's, here's where you're coming from is that God dispensed this grace on you. So, so here, God did this for you and God did this for you and God made this way. And, and every time we see grace, we see God's expression of love. Well, when I see God's expressions of love, it feeds my affection. It builds my affection. And so being faithful to do that just in the, in the simplest debriefing seasons of my life, you know, other ways that I, that I find that happen, I'm a, I'm a music guy and I'm moved by music. And so there's worship music that just takes me there and, and I'm finding, you know, the stuff that helps me with worship music that takes me there, um, is, are the things that are showing me God's love, you know, and, and I, I don't find as much connection to, to things that are speaking to, you know, um, my circumstantial pleasures, but I do resonate when I'm reminded, uh, through that music of, of God's, not just love in the past, but ongoing love that he loves me. And that, again, that, that fosters that love. And, and, and then I think you wrote this somewhere, I saw in an email or something, but in one of our exchanges, just the, sometimes we speak things into reality. Right. And, um, you know, I, I, years ago I heard somebody say words create worlds and I, I absolutely believe that's true. Every time I tell God I love him, I not only am affirming God as if God needs my affirmation, but I'm, I'm building my affection with that. And so practicing that, Hey, looking back, Oh wow. God, I'm just overwhelmed by your immense love for me. I can't escape this. Yeah. Oh, I love you, God. I mean, that all by itself is, is powerful. So, yeah. Oh, and this is such a great time of year where some of us are naturally doing these things already. Yeah. Right. And I know some people are already into the, the new year, new you resolutions, plans, dreams, started the gym membership already went twice, whatever the case is. Good for you. But there's also, I think a really important practice that I've only just started doing in the last few years, which is before we dive into the new year, you take a look back at the last year with the benefit of that hindsight. Those moments where you can go, wow, God, and practice some of that thankfulness and not in an obligatory way. Yeah. You know, Brian and I talked last week about the, what matters, what you do matters, but the how and the why matters more as we so often talk about in this platform in particular, it's about the heart. And he was giving the example of if, if he threatens and, uh, you know, barters with, and otherwise, you know, terrorizes his children to make their bed. The bed gets made. And if he's an incredibly kind and compassionate and loving father and is helping to lead them into taking ownership of their space, the bed gets made. Yeah. Yeah. And so the, what happens, but it's the how and the why that matter more. And so as we're talking about this idea of, of thankfulness and recognizing the grace that God has shown us as a means of not only receiving the affection, a new recognizing the affection when it first was, but also expanding the affection. Again, very practically take stock of the last 12 months. Um, one of my mentors sent something out beginning of the year and he said, go back through your calendar, your camera roll, whatever will help you chronicle the last 12 months and make a list, make a list of the amazing moments that were amazing in the moment that maybe you've lost track of and then make a list of the hard moments, the moments of loss, the moments of grief, the moments of death, whether of a loved one or a dream or whatever, and then sit with that for a second and remind yourself, you don't have to force it, but recall where God was in that moment or ask him to show you even now, God, where were you? I don't feel like I saw you in that moment because tensions were high and, but I see it now. And, and so very specifically, God, I love you for this. I love you for this moment. And I love how you showed up in this moment. And God, thank you for the way that you came through in this moment. Thank you for who you are, big picture, but thank you for who you were here, here and here and here, like you were talking about that, that creates an internal reality that doesn't happen if we're just blithely going on our way, you know, put that year in the past and new year ahead, lots of possibilities, but don't, I mean, so often God would say in the old Testament, make an altar, make an Ebenezer, a rock pile, right. And go back and look, and it's amazing what that does to our awareness of our affection for God. Yeah. And, and when, when we're building that affection, we're building that house of love in our own heart and, and expanding that, then what happens is, you know, we look back to see God's expressions of love in very specific ways, what's going to happen going forward. We don't know. And there are moments in which we find ourselves where, where we're going to go, okay, I'm in this moment. And it's the not yet in my experience with God. And what love does is it creates hope and faith. Yep. So the bigger my love, the greater my hope and the greater my faith, because my love is predicated on, yeah, here's how God showed his love to me. And, and a lot of times, I mean, when I look back through the, whether it's the camera roll or journal entries or whatever, a lot of times what I realize is that the way that God showed up and showed his love to me was not at all. What I expected. Yep. And so, so then what happens is as I entered the new year and I entered the unknown and I'm facing the, the, the place where it's not yet, I go, all right. With expectation, God's going to show up and man, it's going to be really cool because it's not what I expect. Yeah. And I pulled this, uh, I pulled this out as you were talking about this, cause there's a quote that I, you know, I'm pretty sure I'm using the message, but from Scott McKnight that speaks to the motivation, he says this every step we take in every move we make should be in light of what God thinks of what we're doing. This is not some form of perverse legalism any more than my desire, his desire to please his wife. Chris is legalism. A desire to please God is the noblest motivation in life. And to reject such a desire in the name of legalism is to misunderstand our family relationship to God. I, I just, I thought, man, that's, that's on the money, but that the way I lean into and live my life is predicated on this family relationship. This is my father. I love him, which drives my behavior. And it's not out of really an ought to, even though I ought to, you know, even though that's there, that's not why. Right. So, yeah. And we'd be remiss if we didn't mention this as well. Um, not because we're professionally obligated to, but because it's actually helpful, go to the scriptures, um, and go hunting for this, go hunting for the places where God talks to you about how he feels about you. Um, and so there was just a couple that I saw in the last 48 hours. Um, cause you know, sometimes you follow the footnotes and the footnotes take you all over the place. And so you started here, but you end up in 18 different places, but you know, Jeremiah 31, three, the Lord says, I've loved you, my people with an everlasting love, with unfailing love, I've drawn you to myself and you can kind of catch yourself in the moments where you're not feeling it. Yeah. You can catch yourself in the life situations where you know the reality, but you're not feeling it. Yeah. And it's amazing the power that these verses have when you return to it in time of need and you ground yourself in truth and reality. And there was another one that just, again, it popped up cause I was chasing footnotes this morning. Hosea, cause how often do you end up in Hosea? Um, Hosea six, six. I want you to show love, not offer sacrifices, which is part of what you were touching on in your message on Sunday, that this is not just affection this way, but that part of holiness is love this way as well. But then God goes on to say, I want you to know me more than I want burnt offerings, which is part of what we're going to talk about today as well. That holiness is not just about what you do. It truly is at the level of the heart. You know, one of the fascinating things is just, it's a little bit of a side note, but one of the fascinating things about scripture and those places that we go, that we find those deep, rich expressions of God's love are actually in the old Testament in the prophets who are pronouncing hardship on the people. And, and it's in the middle of that. That you see the immense nature of God's love. The previous five verses of Hosea are not super fun. Yeah. And I've always like, like one of the verse, one verse that I've always been struck by moved by love very much in my life that we sing in a great hymn of the faith. Great is thy faithfulness. Your mercies are new every morning. That's in Ecclesiastes is in, it's in a book of mourning, you know, and so, uh, I mean, in lamentations, I'm sorry, in a book of laments and, and it just fascinates me that it's in those harder places, but, but isn't that true about the camera roll of your life? It is that the camera roll is the pictures that you look at and go, there was God's love. It was, it was in the middle of the hard things. Yeah. And, and I like where that takes us. That, that holiness is not a movement away from discomfort. That holiness is not a movement away from challenge. It's not a movement. Oh, it's not a promise that everything now is going to be good. Right. Right. It's, it's, it's not, it is in the midst of everything. Yeah. And so where we're going with this next, because again, the goal is practicality. Oh, that was one of the other things. See, this is why I write notes. This is why I write notes. So the other thing I wanted to touch on with this is this idea of things that cultivate our affection towards God and things that make us aware of God's affection towards us. Um, you know, you'll hear most Sundays, somebody say some version of our mission statement here at a church, the spirit directed people, discipling others to know Jesus as Lord or spirit directed church, discipling people to know Jesus as Lord. And so the idea is that we become spirit directed, that we, we become aware of what the spirit of God in us is saying to us. And so we offer opportunities for people to grow in their ability to discern what God is saying to them. And I know for some people that they really want to do that, but they start doing it in the most stressful moments, right? Uh, job situation is going crazy. God, what do I do? Do I quit my job? Do I move across country for a new job? Now that you don't have a story about that, um, God, I need you to speak to me God, I need you to speak to me right now. That's a really tough spot to begin learning to hear God in your life. This is one of the best places to begin. God, how do you feel about me? As you have time in whatever, wherever, whenever you have your, your time with God, ask him that question and ask him with an expectation that he will respond personally and uniquely to you. God, how do you feel about me? God, do you love me? God, why do you love me? And it's amazing. The things that will start to pop up as you cultivate that as part of your rhythm, as part of your time with God, this interactive conversation. And it's also interesting, the things that he'll reveal, and we're going to touch on this a little bit later. There's some stuff that's going to come up that's actually being revealed so it can be removed. Because there's going to be times where you ask God, God, how do you feel about me? And you're going to kind of wonder, does God actually like me very much? God, I feel like you're kind of ticked at me. God, I, you know, I, I feel like you're not real happy with me right now. Yeah. And, and, you know, some of that is a little bit of the narrative of our culture is that if there's anything confrontational, anything that is in disagreement, you know, that's a lightweight word, you know, as, as compared to what scripture says. But if there's, if there's anything difficult, there are, are rebuking in nature, then that must mean that the one doing that doesn't approve. Yeah. And that's not what scripture says. In fact, what scripture says that it is a demonstration of God's love to show us those places. And, and I think I can unpack that a little bit as it relates to holiness as, as we kind of move on over the next few minutes, but, but it is God's great demonstration of love when he shows us that thing that needs to be removed. And, you know, I mean, one, one text that comes to mind in particular says that those he loves, he disciplines and, and, you know, culturally we've kind of avoided that. Yeah. Because what we want is, you know, the approving God who says yes, yes, yes, yes, yes to everything. And, and what God wants is to make us the kinds of people who are worthy, which means we have to be reformed. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Holiness part of that, and we're going to talk about that a little bit later is there's some removing. Yeah. Yeah. So one of the things we want to talk about on this idea that, because we also recognize that some words, they just, they have bad definitions and some, sometimes that's actually what we need the most help with. It's almost what we need freedom and liberation from. We need liberation from bad definitions. And I know you've had this experience. I'm sure with all the years that you've been pastoring, but the ways that people take holiness and assume that it just means try really hard to be really good. Yeah. And it's entirely about the outward. Yeah. So from a very practical standpoint, how can we begin to defeat some of those bad definitions of holiness? Yeah. So I think first it starts with just a very honest understanding of holiness. And what the directive is, because here's the truth. None of us are holy. In fact, Paul wrote, you know, there's none righteous. No, not one. Uh, he would write in another portion of his writings. Um, all of our righteousness is like filthy rags before God. We can go to the old Testament. We can see a man like Isaiah who stands before a holy God and, and assesses and says, I'm a man of unclean lips. So when we get told be holy, it's an impossible task. If it's do holy. Yeah, that's, there's the great clause. If it's do holy, we can't do holy. That's, I mean, I'm just going to say that right up front. I don't care how many times you read the scripture and the scripture doesn't say do holy. No. And the scripture doesn't say we are fundamentally holy. What the scripture says, be holy for I am holy. And, and so when we first understand that holiness is only an attribute that is appropriately given to God. And what it means when we speak of holiness as it relates to God, that God is perfect in righteousness and we are inadequate at best. I mean, that's clear. So what God is saying is I'm holy. I'm going to give you my holiness. It was said of Abraham that, you know, because of his faith, it was imputed unto him as righteousness, that God gave him that, that God made him that. Not he did something. In fact, if you read the stories throughout scripture, men that we would call holy, all of them have places where you go, oh, well, that's not very holy. And, and so I think a part of our undoing the bad definition is going, okay, first of all, the definition of holiness is God. He is the definition of holy, not, not popular opinion, not some kind of convenient definition, not even some enlightened definition. God is the definition of holy. Now I can only be holy as God gives me holiness. And then I have to, I have to receive that from him and let him work out the holiness in me. Um, so in practical application for me, um, one, I, I'm off of, or I work hard to take myself off of the performance treadmill that says, okay, well, if I do this, this, this, you know, I, it equates to holiness because the truth of the matter is I'll do this, this, and this, but then I'll follow it up with that. And in the gates of the three to one doesn't balance out. Yeah, exactly. And so, uh, so I take myself off that performance treadmill and go, this is not a standard of approval, but this is a standard of character and this is character that is given to me by God. And so it's not about what I do. It's about who I am and it's about letting God reform who I am. Certainly I'm going to put things in my life that are. For lack of a better word, stimulates towards better living, you know, so I get rid of some of the, that's in my life. But, um, but I'm going to let God do that. And he does that through the work of the Holy spirit. And he does that. Some of that, he reveals some of those things that needs to go away. And I yield to that. So a very practical way that I lean into this work that God's doing in me to give me holiness is this, I try every day to begin my day with today's yours. And so am I. Uh, I saw on social media today. I, uh, I think Andy Stanley put out this, um, uh, a prayer for every day. And it's a surrender. I surrender my hands, my head, my eyes, my feet. I surrender all of me. And I try to do that and let God do that in me. So you say more about that idea of surrender. Cause again, I think this is getting us in that direction of defeating the bad definition of holiness, because again, and I know it's one of those things that's here, but we catch ourselves halfway into the act of, okay, but if I just do more good things and so the idea of starting your day with, I'm not going to make my list of all my good things to do. I'm going to start my day by surrendering me at an identity level to pursue holiness. Talk more about that. Yeah. So yeah, the idea of surrender, I mean, fundamentally, you know, this has been something that, um, you know, we've, we've talked about in the circles that I've grown up in all of my life, the idea of surrender to the Lordship of the Holy Spirit in your life. And, and we talk about being spirit directed and, and, and I, I believe that there's a very specific invitation that we make to God to direct us and he won't go unless we invite him. I mean, I, I found that true. I mean, he'll let me do whatever I want to do. And then I'll come to him and go, uh, there's a mess here. Why did you let me do that? Exactly. And I can just imagine God in heaven going, yeah, I know I told you so. And, and maybe that's how we'll spend eternity with God saying, Hey, remember that moment where your choices have to matter because otherwise the choice to surrender doesn't matter. Exactly. But, uh, so, so there's that. There, there is the reality that there's a very tangible and specific need on our to invite God into our life and not just to accompany us. Cause I think, I think that's where, um, I feel often we get stuck is that we, we want the presence of God and some, for some people that means, uh, you know, I want my body guard, you know, so I want protection, uh, for other people, it means I want my friends so that I've got somebody to, you know, moan to about my life or whatever, but, but that's not it. You know, we can't be satisfied with merely the presence of an omnipresent God. He's already there, right? So what we're inviting him to is to, to the activity of control, to the activity of direction, which says, let me affirm you in the places you need to be affirmed. Let me confront you in the places where you need to be confronted and let me make the decisions. And those three things are really hard. Yeah, they're really hard. And I know it seems like, well, affirming me is not hard, but for a lot of people, it really is, it really is hard to have God say, you know, I'm pleased with you. Well done. It did to think that God would rejoice over us with singing as one of the old Testament prophets would describe it is, is really for probably many of us, most of us, uh, a very difficult challenge. And then the idea of letting God confront us, well, that's just politically incorrect. So, so we've kind of unwritten that, uh, you know, and so that's a, that's a whole new, you know, I'm willing to hear my, my brokenness. I'm willing to hear my failures. I'm willing to hear those places and then, and then to let God make the decisions that, you know, I think, I think we have a bit of a naive, yeah, I want God to direct me, but if God's going to direct, it means that when he says go, we go. And when he says stop, we stop. And, and so when, when I, in the course of the beginning of my day, say today's yours, I surrender these hands, these feet, these eyes, this mouth, my mind, my thoughts, my passions. I surrender it all to you. You take me where you want me. You say to me what needs to be said to me. You use me how you want to use me. There's a hands off and saying, okay, Lord, I'm going to take what you give. Right. And that's where I'm going to function. Yeah. And not just say those things and then run off into your day and hope. Well, exactly. I hope he shows up, but it's interactive. Exactly. In fact, for, I heard a, uh, a speaker one time say, you know, the problem with living sacrifices, if you think about Paul's language in, um, in some of his writing, he says, we should be living sacrifices, offer ourselves to sacrifice. He said, the problem with living sacrifices is they crawl off the altar. They do. And, and I know for me, I am absolutely guilty of the above. Um, and so I'm often, you know, I may start my day there, but I'm often brought back to, oh yeah, Lord. Yeah. Okay. You know, and, and so it works like this. I mean, like you and anybody else. So I, you know, I have good intention. So I'm standing in front of the mirror, getting ready to brush my teeth, Lord. Today's yours. And it all works great while I'm brushing my teeth, shaving my face, watching my hair, exactly. It'd all be great. But then I run into people, you know, and then I start interacting with people and I run into tasks and I run into deadlines and I run into expectations and I run into crises and I run, I mean, all of it. I run into my day and all of the sudden I start working my day. Yeah. I work my calendar. I work my to-do list. I work my relationships. I work. I, because that's what I've been built to do. That's what you've been built to do. That's what you've been built to do. That's that's we, we work our day. And before I know it, I'm working without God at all. And so I have to be brought back and say, God, it's yours. It's yours. And often what happens is I find myself in this situation and, you know, I, I can't tell you how many times I've been in meetings, literally in meetings and in the middle of a meeting had this, uh, spiritual tap on the shoulder. Hey, can I, can I jump in? I have some thoughts here and I have to pause, you know, and, and, and either publicly or privately just go, okay, Lord, I'm yours. What do you want here? And, and, you know, it's easy to be eyes wide open. Like I'm driving to an appointment where I know I'm going to have a conversation that's difficult and say, okay, God, I want to be yours. I want to be available, but, but it's another thing to just be in the middle of working my day and, and forget that I've invited God in and I'm so glad he loves me enough to go back to that, to tap me on the shoulder and say, Hey, let's revisit this, let me in. And, and I hope that the longer I have followed him, the better I've gotten at saying, yeah, Lord, you know, this sacrifice is crawling back up on the altar. Jump in. Yeah, I need, I need you. Yeah. Yeah. And, and as he always does, Jesus gives us the model and it's not an impossible model. No, it's a really difficult model, but it's not impossible to, when he says, I only do what I see the father doing. And I only say what I hear the father saying. That's the model. That's what we're working towards. That's who we're becoming. And it's not, it's not what we're doing. It's, it's truly, we're becoming the kind of people. We're becoming the kinds of sons and daughters who are so attuned to the spirit of God inside of them and to their heavenly father, whose will we want done on earth as it's being done in heaven, that that's who we are. We are the people who do God things God's way, rather than people that just try really hard to do good things. And that that's, and I think that's why this gets so difficult for so many of us. It is, it's that compartmentalization you were talking about. It's I'm brushing my teeth with God. I'm having my meetings with me. I'm having the post meeting review with God and I'm having the next meeting with me and it's this constant like catch up makeup. And, and that's, that's not bad. It's just not where we're meant to stay. We really do get to have the presence of the omnipresent God with us in all of it. And help us, you know, I forget who it was now, Chesterton, since we are the sons of God, let us become the sons of God. That's the, it's, it, this is holiness is who we're becoming, not what we're doing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you, and you said it well. You know, Jesus gave us the model and the model's not impossible, but we have to, let's just acknowledge it right now. Let's just all kind of put it right out here on the table. There is an enemy that makes it hard. That's, that's why you follow that statement with, Hey, you know, it's not a difficult, but it can be hard. It can be hard because there's an enemy who, who rules this broken world right now. And, and he wants to lure us away from being connected with a holy God because he's unholy and so the, you know, the environment around us, uh, is bending to his direction, so it's unholy around us. And for us to behave holy, which means saying God here, whatever, you know, I surrender for us to be that person is an anomaly to what's going on around us. And the enemy has schemed that intentionally. Yeah. That's not by accident. No, not at all. And that's a great transition, by the way. It's like you and me have been doing these shows forever. That was a great transition to our last point of you have an enemy and you have a way of doing things that for however long existed before you came to know God personally, and then started trying to live with him personally, that's pretty well ingrained in your brain, in your will. Yeah. And so when we talk about holy living, when we talk about becoming holy, when we talk about be holy, live holy, Brian and I talked about this last week as well, that this, this isn't just about go do good things, right? Right. Right. That, that implicit in the idea of holiness is that there's going to be some internal restoration that's needed as well. This isn't just, we clean up everything and all your motives, your prayer going forward, and you never do a bad thing again, because like you were talking about with the old Testament patriarchs, that ain't happening either, but that they're part of being holy, part of becoming holy is that there's going to be some internal work done that you need to be consciously aware of. There's a whole lot that's going to happen without your awareness, but there's a lot that you need to be aware of. And we talked about this last week with, um, I had mentioned, I was sort of jumping around again, following footnotes and went from the genealogy of Jesus in Matthew one, back to some of those people in his family line in first and second Kings. And, and you see sort of the highlight reel of there's a few really good, righteous people that do all the things that God ever asked them to do. And it seems like they really seem to hit the Jesus model of they're just doing what God's doing. And they're just saying what God's saying. And then there's some absolute train wrecks of humanity in Jesus's family line that are just the worst of the worst of the worst. And then there's this third group that the scriptures describe as they did the good things, but they did not tear down the high places. And it sort of gets to what you were just talking about of there, there's some things in us. There's some ways that we've been doing things at the prompting of the enemy through agreement with him saying, no, this is the right way to live. And we go, yeah, that sounds really good or much easier or whatever. And we go do that for however long we do it. And so as part of this becoming holy, there's going to have to be an intentional awareness of where your idols are, which is what the high places where it's the other idols. It's the other things we look to for security, for comfort, for protection, for provision. There's going to have to be a direct addressing of those things as part of becoming holy. Yeah. And I'm glad you're bringing that up because I think that one of the things that this pastor's heart, uh, aches over as it relates to the current climate in our world is that we have abandoned a truth in scripture. And that is that we are a confessional community and, um, we've, we've stopped doing that, you know, we've, we've self-actualized, I suppose is the right way to say it. And, and I don't think we can get to holiness without brokenness. I mean, that's, that's an imperative and, and for us to be holy as he is holy for us to receive his holiness requires the, the work of confession. And, um, you know, we, we had an era where confession looked in a particular way and it certainly was a part of our conversation and it's something that we've abandoned, uh, for comfort, I believe, uh, you know, because it's far more comfortable to avoid confession, you know, to, and a part of what we do is, and, and this speaks to this tearing down on the high place without tearing or having not torn down the high places is a part of what we do is we, we are confronted by our unholiness and we go, okay, I got to stop doing that. And we just think, okay, by stopping doing that all as well. But the problem is we still have the blemish. We still have the, and, and, and the blemish is not a marker against our record. The blemish is a breach in our relationship with our father and the, and the only bridge to heal the relationship in that breach in the relationship is through confession. And, and so we have to, we need to rebuild that place. We need to restore that art. We need to lean back into learning to say, God, forgive me. I confess. Yeah, I confess. I leaned back into the old way. I leaned into my brokenness. I leaned into my proclivity towards failure and, and, and it's there that we start to now tear down the high places, you know, that, that we, that we begin to build the character of holiness, not just the behavior of holiness. And so I'm, I'm really glad you brought that up. I know for me, you know, I feel like, and, and, and people hear me say this and they, and they think, I thought you were a pastor, you should be past this. But, but I feel like that a regular part of my conversation with God is there's often something where I go, God, I just, I need to confess this to you. I know you know it, but I need to make this right. And, and I hope that those areas are less egregious if there's a, if there's a scale, but I hope that the longer I follow him, that they're, that they're less, but, but I, I'm constantly in that place. And, and I got to be honest that I don't want to lose that place because the freedom that happens in confession is unparalleled. It is. And, and I think we're settling for a counterfeit freedom when we don't know the pathway of confession. And so much of our lived experience has trained us to believe that confession is going to hurt in a way that makes it not worth it. Yeah. Yeah. Right. That, that God's just going to beat me up one side and down the other and shame me and embarrass me and condemn me for all these stupid things that I did. And I should have just known better the whole time. Right. And so let's just not even bring it up. Right. Let's not even bring it up and we'll just move forward and pretend like everything's okay. Sweep it under the rug. And that's not holiness. Yeah. It's not freedom because you know, as well as I do, you can feel the weight of it. It's your carry. It's conformity, which is what Peter and Paul both have said. Don't conform, but it's conformity. That's what it is. I'm going to just conform my behavior. I'm not going to restore it. I'm not going to rebuild. I'm just going to conform it. Yeah. And so, and maybe, I don't know if this is a wrap up statement, but you know, the, the thing that for me in this passage, and it speaks to this whole process that we've talked about from top to bottom, that just was overwhelming and continues to be overwhelming as I think about it. So the nature of holiness is so lofty, you know, like Webster prefaces, prefaces his definition or their definition by saying worthy of worship and praise, perfect in righteousness. And that whole lofty nature of holiness that we, that we understand, even if we can't articulate it, that we understand that perfection of righteousness. Um, it by its definition has to reject anything that's unholy. Yeah. Like, like even the slightest unholiness has to be repudiated by holiness. Otherwise it's not holiness anymore. And so for God to say I'm holy, there is no space for unholy with him. Yeah. And so there's, there's three options. There is compromised God's holiness. There is totally alienate ourselves as unholy people from a holy God. Or the third option is grace. And that's the option that God chose that God gave us his holiness. And so, yes, God judges us. So let's not kind of dance around that. God judges. He is the judge and he judges impartially. Which means if the law says it's wrong, the moral law, holy law of God says it's wrong, it's wrong. And there's judgment for that. But that same judge gets out from behind the bench and comes and stands by our side because he's for us. And he says, listen, where we fall short, where we are unholy, where we have a blemish here, just pour mine on top of it. Now look at this holiness. I, even talking about it, uh, that's overwhelming. Yeah. That is immense love displayed by grace and the aspiration for holiness becomes a very reasonable aspiration because of his holiness. Yeah. That was good. So hopefully this has helped on your journey to holiness, that this truly is what we are becoming, not just what we're doing. Yeah. And there is no part of this where we have to do it ourselves, but we do have to participate. We do. We have an active role, but that active role is usually one of surrender, of receiving, of obeying and following and trusting. And so as always, we hope that this has helped you take another practical step forward to have a better sense of, okay, good idea.
