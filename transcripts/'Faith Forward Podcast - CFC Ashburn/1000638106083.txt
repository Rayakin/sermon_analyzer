Welcome back to the Faith Forward Podcast, John Ackerman. Joining me today is Pastor Lee Towns, our digital pastor. I'm back again. I'm so glad you're here, man. We always have fun together. We do, we do. Before we dive in, I've been making this pitch at either the beginning or the end of the last several episodes. This is episode, I believe, 94 in our Faith Forward archives. And so as we get closer to the 100th episode, it felt like it'd be a cool thing to do, to do something, to commemorate that space. And it just so happens that the 100th episode will come out on Super Bowl Sunday, February 11th. There you go. And that also happens to coincide with the ending of a planned series on how we are better together. And so it just seemed like a space for us to take advantage of this platform and the invitation to take your faith forward, not just individually, but as a group of people who are collectively interested in walking this life with God. And so here's the invitation to all of you, whether you're faithful listeners or you're just joining us here, send us three minutes, either on video or audio, or just send an email that either Brian or I, or whoever's sitting in that chair on that Sunday, because honestly, I haven't looked. I think it may be you interviewing you. It may be. So we'll get somebody in that chair because nobody needs a monologue, but. That's what Sundays are for. That's right. We don't need it twice. We don't need it twice. We would love to just have the 100th episode be a collection of the stories of what God is doing in his people as they attempt to walk with him and as they accept his invitation into life with him. So again, in whatever format you're most comfortable with, send us a video of you on your cell phone, or if you've got a really nice setup at home, take advantage of that. Send us three minutes about what it's looked like for you to take your faith forward over these last months or years. Send us just an audio recording. If you don't want your face up, we'll throw a graphic up in its place so nobody has to worry about that. And if you don't want to see yourself or hear yourself, because I get that having to watch these videos as I edit them, send us an email. We'll read it. But we want to celebrate and commemorate what God is doing in the lives of his people as we talk about the reality that we are better together. So with that said, this whole series on Nehemiah, which we are now, and I've been waiting to use this word, the penultimate week. Sorry, you have to go back in the archives for that one. That's been a little bit of a joke here. The penultimate week of this series of Nehemiah, we've got one week left. And so Lee, you're here to talk about a few chapters that has a little bit more to it than people were expecting, but there's a couple of jokes around that as well. But if you've missed the recap, I'm not going to attempt to recap 10 weeks of this because that would take half the episode. But the beginning of this was Nehemiah's journey of discovering the burden God has placed on him spiritually to then the burden of the reality of the physical undertaking. But then the reality that the physical undertaking was not all that God was after. There was actually a spiritual restoration that was at the heart of all of this. And now we come to this place where God's people, having completed the physical work, are recognizing that God was after something deeper inside of them. And so we've talked about that over the last couple of weeks. And so Lee, talk about where we're going this Sunday as you take us through chapters 10, 11, and 12. Yeah, so we're going to go through chapters 10, 11, 12. By the time you listen to this, we will have gone through chapters 10, 11, and 12. I will tell you that we will not have gone through this verse by verse. If you look at those chapters, it's another collection of names. And those parts of scripture, sometimes we overlook because they seem meaningless and tedious. And that could be the view, if you're not careful, of these chapters. Because what is encapsulated in these chapters is the people who signed this pledge, this vow. We came right up to the edge of the vow last week as we looked at chapter 9. And the people have gone through that process of confession, taking that step of repentance. And then chapter 10 kind of opens up with, here are all the people that signed off on this collective written vow that they make. And so half of chapter 10 is just signatures, is what it is. And then another list of signatures when they get into chapter 11 and talk about the rehabitation of Jerusalem. And here are all the people who moved to different places throughout Israel as the country and the city had been rebuilt. And the country was being reconfigured in that process. And then in the middle of that, there is the text of the vow. And it culminates in chapter 12, which we don't spend much time on, with the dedication of the wall and the rebuilt Jerusalem. And there's a worship celebration that happens there at the end of chapter 12. And so in the middle of that, though, in the middle of all those names is this, what is the essence of what they're doing? And as you look at that chapter, what you see is, it almost is like God goes, okay, so here I'm going to tell you the secret behind the secret, you know? And so here's this big headline story about walls that were crumbling, needed to be rebuilt, and this amazing physical project that these people endeavor to embark on and accomplish in amazing time. But as God is always wanting to do, there is something beneath that. And God always gives us this physical expression of a spiritual reality. And the book of Nehemiah is actually about that, about how God is realigning the hearts of his people with him, and how God is doing a reconstruction work in this people. I'm always taken back whenever I make my way through the Old Testament, the pattern of the people to love God, wander from God, be under judgment as a result of that, and come back to God. And I always think, oh, why won't these people learn? And then I look in the mirror. And go, this is, you know, this is just a story of humanity. This is what we do, and it's our rhythm, and God knows it's our rhythm. And so he gives us these great stories of reordering, which is what the title of the message is, is a reordered life. And what does a reordered life look like? And in simple terms, God has invited us to experience a reordered life. He's called us as his children to something greater. We've been talking about through this message, and here's the hidden secret. The something greater is not rebuilt walls. The something greater is a reordered life. And God has called us to that. And, you know, I don't really talk about it in the message, but in my mind, you just need to know that as I have preached this message, I keep hearing Jesus' words out of John 10. I've come that you might have life and that you might have it abundant. And the whole secret of Jesus entering our world, was he entered our world to reorder the broken mess. And then he provides for us a pathway to that reordered life. And so there are a variety of ways in which that reordered life gets expressed that provide for us, I think, some principles of what it looks like to have a reordered life for us. There were specific steps within those principles that the people took. That we talked about in the context of the message, but the principles, you know, those specific steps may not be the same for me as they were for them. It might be the same for you as they were for them. But the principles are the same. And so as we work through the vow, you start to see categories or principles of accomplishing a reordered life. So there is a very abstract way of looking at it. Abstract re-evaluation or restatement of the message. We can dive in to some of those areas and I'll let you guide us through that exploration. Yeah. And so as always, the invitation is make sure you check out the message if you happen to stumble across this here first. And as always, and I love that this isn't something that I just have to say, but you should check out the message first. You're really going to want to hear this before you hear what we talk about. Because it's just going to make so much more sense. And in particular, in this place where at its heart, like you said on Sunday, we're talking about sanctification. Right. And I think the challenge is that sometimes what we've turned sanctification into, what we've turned the gospel into, what we've turned Jesus's desire into is some oversimplified version of be better and do better. Right. And if we allow that to persist as sort of the underlining premise through which we hear and see everything else, we're really going to miss a lot of what God's after in this reordered life. Yeah. And it reminds me, you know, we were both athletes, both played basketball. And it makes me think about, you know, if a coach ever said, look, the goal is to win games. The goal is to put the ball in the basket. And I don't care how you do it. I just want you to do it. That is a viable way of coaching. Yeah. I think most would argue it's not the best way. Right. That you're going to end up with a lot of disorder in your pursuit of winning the game and getting the ball in the hoop. Basketball may become football. Right, right. The way you do something matters as much as what you do, if not more so. Right, right. And so the way you put the ball in the hoop and the way you go about trying to win the game matters. And any good coach I would imagine would tell you that they have the long view of the season. Yeah. Not just the short view of the game. And so winning any cost to win the game usually has detrimental effects in the long term. And so what God's after here in this chapter and in us, in our lives, is this reordering of the way we do things, not just what we do. And so you opened up with this fundamental premise of a reordered life begins with a commitment to follow God, God's way. Yeah, yeah. And I think for most of us, just pausing right there and letting that sit for a second, because one, that's the premise for the rest of this episode. Yeah. Is that following God, God's way is the invitation. But to give ourselves a moment to process the ways in which we have attempted to follow God out of our own best understanding of what we think we're supposed to do, rather than just looking at what God said is God's way to follow God. Right. And I'm also struck by the reality that, like you said, we look at, you know, these people in Nehemiah and go, oh, those people. And then hopefully we hold the mirror up and go, oh, I am people. Right. I am people. Right. But we keep looking for a lower level of commitment. Yeah. I think if we're being honest. Yeah, I think that's true. I think that's true. That God sends out this invitation for a reordered life to walk with God, God's way. And we keep going, yeah, but. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, I mentioned this in the message that, you know, the very beginning of the vow says we're going to once again commit to obey the law that you give us. And the history tells us that, you know, God gave the law through Moses and the people, you know, with different, differing levels of intensity would be obedient to the law. And, and, you know, I'm, I'm just, I'm reminded that there's a pattern of, okay, God, we'll follow your law. And, and they say that, you know, we're going to follow your law. In fact, they wind up where they are, even before the chaos of Jerusalem, they wind up where they are in this land and say, we're here set apart. I mean, it's a great phrase that scripture uses set apart purely and exclusively for God. And we're here to obey God's laws. And, um, and then over time, you know, uh, compromise sets in and there's some level of abandoning that idea of I'm committed to go God's way in his way. Um, and, and they find themselves in disrepair, much like the city of Jerusalem. And they are reaffirming the, you know, what we want to go God's way. Every time I watched that pattern, this is going to date me. I know, but I think about, uh, the there's the very end of this Burt Reynolds movie, the end, and he's being chased by Dom DeLuise and Dom DeLuise is trying to kill him. And Dom DeLuise is a little bit crazy. And, and Reynolds runs into the ocean and then finds himself out too far in the ocean. And he's trying to figure out how to get back to shore. And there's this monologue that Burt Reynolds is having as he's talking to God. And he goes, God, if you'll just give me back to the ocean, I'll give you everything I have. And then he swims a little bit. God, if you'll give me back to the ocean, I'll give you 90% of everything I have. And with every little bit, he gets closer to the shore. His negotiation with God is I'll give you less and less and less. And I think for us, obedience to God's law sometimes looks like that, that God, I'm in a crisis. I will go your way, whatever you want. And then God comes through. Right. And then we start to say, okay, well, I'll kind of go your way and I'll, you know, and we just kind of, uh, abandoned that, that commitment to say, I'm going your way in your way. And, and, and we turn around and go, wait, why does this look like it's supposed to look? And, and because we've negotiated our way out and, and we've, you know, we don't feel is quite as important for us to, to be committed to the holistic way of God. And, and at the end, we find ourselves coming back and going, you know, everything you said is true and everything you've said is right. And everything you've said is for my benefit. So I need to go your way in everything. And so they lead with this, as I talk about the message, they lead with this broad, we commit ourselves to obey your law. And, you know, I think the beginning of a reordered life is, yeah, I'm committed to a reordered life in its full and comprehensive measure. Yeah. So, and so as we talk about these different categories where God's inviting us to re well, he's inviting us to let him reorder our life. You had a few points on Sunday. And so we're going to talk through these categories of, of where God's reordering. And so the invitation with each of these categories is, is really to park on two particular thoughts. And Lee, you brought up the first one through this idea of syncretism, right? And I love that as a history teacher, because I taught that for years. But the idea that as, as humanity, as the human experience, we have constantly tried to incorporate new things into old things and create a fusion of the two. That sometimes works out really well in food. It often works out horribly when it comes to the things of God. Right. And so the first place to begin to ask ourselves questions that help us to take our faith forward is where have I attempted to have a blended relationship with God? Yeah. Where have I tried to have a little bit of God's way and a little bit of something else, whether it's my way or somebody else's way, or just something that looks easier or more attractive or more certain or less painful or pick whatever the something else is. But to sit with that, that question, because the reality is like you said, a reordered life is a life that is exclusively God's and that that's the first place of reordering. Yeah. And the first place of tension for us is we've often looked for a lower level of commitment. Yeah. We've often looked for the Burt Reynolds. I'll give you however much I can get away with. Yes. However much I have to give to get what I want. And so there's a few places we want to take this just by way of examples, because one of the things that I've found in my own life and as I've gotten to walk with people, especially people over time, is that again, this is really less about, it is about the rules. It is about the be better, do better, but it's not first about that. It's about the way you do it, not what you do. And so what I've often found is that as categories are exposed, the beliefs and assumptions that I've made in a category of my life are driving thoughts and behaviors. Yeah. And if those beliefs and categories go unexamined, then the behaviors continue to play themselves out as they always have. Yeah. And so as we begin to look at these categories where God is inviting us to allow things to be properly ordered, to be reordered, to sit with this question perpetually of where have I tried to have a blended relationship with God? Yeah. And what are the things that I believe are true about God that's kept me from allowing things to be exclusively God's and insisted on the partial. So I've got a couple of thoughts on this, but Lee, I didn't know if there was any place in particular you wanted to dive in first in this category. This category, I mean, this has so many nuances and so many places that we can go with it. And I truly believe that the idea of being exclusively God's is a lifetime journey. Yeah. And it is, for lack of a better analogy, it's like peeling an onion. Yeah. I mean, I'm just finding new nuances to it, but kind of the anchor in the text or the contextual anchor is that the people reaffirm a commitment to not intermingle or intermarry with the people of the land. And the heart behind it had nothing to do with prejudicial kinds of racial things, but it was really around the bringing of pagan religion and worship practices into this people that was purely God's. And the idea of purity and the idea of exclusivity really is the idea that God is getting at. And when I am exclusively God's, here's where I'm driving with this whole kind of rabbit trail, but when I'm exclusively God's, I've given God permission to rework every part of me, every single part of me. Yep. And because it's his, this, you are the title holder to every nuance of my life is what fundamentally is the call for us. If we're going to have a reordered life, frankly, I think it probably has its roots right here. I mean, yeah, there's the big broad commit to go God's way in God's way, but in that, not only am I going to discipline myself to do the right things in the way that you've told me to do the right things, but I'm going to say to you, I'm now yours and you can do in and with and through me whatever you'd like to do. And so, you know, I, I just start to look at my own life and go, okay, so where are ways in which that exclusivity starts to get violated? And sometimes they're big, grandiose ways, but then more often than not, it's the little nudges. It's the, it's the little ways where, you know, for example, I, you know, very easy for me to say, okay, um, that whole reordered life, if I can have order in my schedule, or I can have order in the way I'm doing something, then I can do it in a way that honors God. That's what God asked me for. God asked me to give my schedule to him and not trust in my ability to bring order to that, but actually trust in his ability to lead me to what he wants in said schedule. You know, and that's a, that's a little tiny way, but that, you know, that pagan worship of my calendar can, you know, can be one of those ways in which I'm trying to, uh, manage in the culture where I am and, and can easily come out, not looking like gods at all. I can look like Lees and, and my life is no longer exclusively his, but now it's partially mine in that way. I think about, you know, like ways in which we cope can be ways in which we bring in cultural management, uh, kinds of tactics rather than saying, you know, you are my peace, you are my shelter, you are, you know, and I, I remember, um, and I am drawing a blank on the counselor, uh, right now, but I remember reading an article by a well-known counselor who said, I have decided to no longer drink wine. And he said, it has nothing to do with whether or not wine is a theological violation or not. It has everything to do with what I discovered was I would go have a stressful day at work and I would come home and say, I need a glass of wine just to unwind from my day. And I was confronted in my spirit as God was working in me that I was trusting my glass of wine rather than trusting him. So I abandoned that practice. It's, it's those kinds of little things that, that are where we begin to blend. We begin to suffer the, the syncretism. Of course, I, you know, we can talk about syncretism in terms of, you know, we bring in ideas from different kinds of religions and say, okay, how can we make this idea work with the way of Christianity? And those are big, glaring, you know, syncretistic, uh, habits that, that we need to be aware of. But, but I actually think that what God is getting at in my own life and probably if that's true in my own life and our lives together is the little ways in which we have fallen prey to syncretism and we're no longer exclusively his. Yeah. Yeah. And I've noticed just how prone I am to falling off on multiple sides of this that, and I mentioned this before, you know, when I was teaching in the high school, it took me years before I realized I was trying to do my work without God. Yeah. And not, you know, from a, you know, God get out of here, but it was the, I've got this. Yeah. Yeah. I think I have this well in hand. Don't want to trouble you here, God, you've got, you've got big things to take. I'll take care of this. And so I had my life with God and I had my work life or there's the, I come home after an exhausting day and it's the, well, I need to rest. I need to recover. And so I want a glass of wine or I want to just turn on the TV and veg for a little bit or, and so I've got my recovery time. And to be fair to the liquids, it could also be a cup of coffee. It could. So, right. So this is not about, this is not about alcohol. It's not making a rule. It's the, but it's the recognition opportunity. Exactly. Yeah. But it's the, it's, it's the idolatry that syncretism brings of I'm bringing in these other things that also offer the promise of comfort and security and provision and hope and whatever else. And so this first step in the reordered life is a reordered life is exclusively. God's, but it also comes, I think, with some bad definitions that we have to overcome because it's really easy to flip to the other side of this of, all right. So then in my work, I have to, and I'm going to go over the top with this. So this is not aimed at anyone. And so if it feels like I'm targeting anyone, I'm not, I'm just trying to paint with an overly broad brush. Then if I'm going to have, you know, an exclusively God life, I'm going to take my Bible to work and leave it open on my desk so that other people see it. And I'm going to pray audibly when other people around so that they know that I'm honoring God in my work. And I'm going to hang up religious, you know, motifs in my workspace so that people know. And when I come home, I'm only going to listen to Christian music. I'm never going to listen to anything else. And I'm only ever going to watch the chosen on TV and nothing else. If I watch that, if I watch it, right. And, and, and I'm going to, that's not the point either. Exactly. Yeah. That's almost an idolatry of religion. That's exactly right. And so what we're talking about is not both of those take us to the same place of me trying to figure out my way to follow God instead of following God, God's way. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I, and this is in anywhere in our notes and it's not in the message narrative, but it, but it is just a, you know, kind of a sense, even in this conversation that I have, you know, there is a directive that is stated old and new Testament of variety ways. But most clearly, I think it, I think Paul references it be holy, even as I am holy. And there is a call to us for a holy life and a holy life is, is very different than a religious puritanical life. Father may be some threads of that, that, you know, show up in, in our lives that, you know, a pagan world would look at and say, yeah, you live like a Puritan. But the reality is that, you know, what makes something holy is God. Yeah. There's nothing I can do. There's nothing about me that makes something holy. And that's true of anybody that we, we don't bring holiness to the equation. Only God does, which means God needs to show up in my life everywhere because he brings holiness to it. And that is not a, like you said, it's not a placard on the wall. It's not an open Bible laying on the desk. It's not a certain genre of music or television. It's, it is about the presence of God where I am. That's what it is. So when I go to my work or I go to my gym or I go to the store where I'm buying my groceries, or I go to my house or I go to my homeowner's association meeting, name the spot, God's there. When I'm mowing the grass, God's there. When I'm pulling weeds out of the flowerbed, God's there. And he brings a holiness to it. Not because I put a label on it or I wore a t-shirt, but because I put God in it. Exactly. And that's this essence of that. And in fairness, this is a lifelong journey that God's invited us to. It is. Yeah. And so again, like we talked about with the basketball analogy at the beginning, the ball can go in the hoop any number of ways, but how it gets there often matters more. It does. Yeah. So you talked about a couple of the ways that God is reordering our life. So the second thing you said is that a reordered life is a life focused on God. So nuance that a little bit between a reordered life as a life that is exclusively God's, and a reordered life as a life focused on God. So yeah, the life focused on God is a little bit different than exclusively his. Because it's easy to say, oh, aren't you saying kind of the same thing? And no, I'm not. This really has to do about my awareness of God in my life. Not just bringing God into the moment and not allowing God to be in my life, but it's also me living with my attention on God. And again, it'd be very easy for you to go, well, that's why the music and the viewing of the TV and the books I read, and that's why I need all the slogans around. And maybe that's helpful, right? But that's not the end game. A focused life is really a life that is lived with the attention always being that God is bringing into my life that holiness, and that he's there, that I don't ignore him. He's not the unnoticed part of my life. I use this statement in the message that God's not a decoration in our life, but he's the axis around which our life revolves. And so it's that shift in my mind of God is here. It's not so much what God does, it's what I do. It's a change in my thinking. And that's where Sabbath shows up, which is where the vow lives. When they start writing their vows, they're reaffirming the Sabbath. And the Sabbath is really about making sure things are in focus, that the axis is in the center, and that you recognize that that's the axis around which you're revolving and you're tied to that. And Sabbath is often confused with an extended sleep, like I need a nap. So that's what Sundays are for. And while that may be a part of the thing, because we have this one-dimensional tunnel vision view of Sabbath, that Sabbath is about taking a day off because I'm tired and exhausted from work. And there's some truth to that. That's a thread of it. But Sabbath is about making sure the picture is in focus. So remember the Ten Commandments that this is built on is, remember the Sabbath and keep it holy. So I'm going to go back to what makes something holy is God. So that means that God is part of the Sabbath. You know, I know this from a whole bunch of different things in my life, but the most prolific is these glasses that I wear. And, you know, I get up and I spray a little solution on my glasses. I take a tissue and I clean my glasses and it's awesome. I can see things are good, but it takes all of about 30 seconds and there's muck on my glasses again. And the longer I go without cleaning my glasses, the less it's awesome. The less it's in focus, the more there's stuff. Life works just like that. And our focus on God happens like that. And the Sabbath is taking those spiritual glasses off, cleaning them so that we can see clearly through them. And so, and that's that focus on God. That's, and a reordered life is a life that says, I am going to pay attention to the focus. And I use an illustration from photography, but you're part of the problem with a podcast is I don't want to tell all my stories, but a photographer knows you've got to always check the focus. Yeah, absolutely. And again, it's not just what to do. It's how it's being done. And so the idea of the Sabbath isn't God's your boss and he gave you a day off, so rest up before you get back to work. Because like you said, it's keep the Sabbath holy. What makes things holy? It's God in it that makes, so God's there on your rest day and your work day, right? There is no separation. There is no lesser commitment. And it makes me think of, in addition to sports, we also share an affinity for music and theater. And it makes me think of my days singing in a choir that there's a conductor. And it's my job to sing the note, but it's his job to tell me how and how long and at what volume, because I can sing the correct note, but I can hold it too long if it was meant to be shorter or cut it off when it was meant to be held or too loud when he's trying to make it quieter or too quietly when it's supposed to be big and bold. And so it's my job to sing the note, but at his direction. And so I had to be laser focused on my conductor at all times, no matter how much we had rehearsed. It wasn't that, oh, where's my parents in the audience? Look around. Are any of my friends here? Right. I have to be laser focused on him because he's telling me how to do the thing that I've been practicing. And so it is with this reordered life is refocused on God exclusively as the one who is doing the conducting. And so are we working or are we resting? Oh, okay. We're working. How are we working? Is this loud? Is it loud or quiet? Is it extended or short? Oh, we're resting. Okay. So we're not working. How are we resting? Yeah. Right. Is it a nap or is it sometimes there are, and I love that Sabbath is restoration. Yes. Not just a rest. Exactly. And there are restorative things that sometimes task us a little bit, but it's restorative. Right, right. And so again, we're focused on him. It's not just that we've committed to following God God's way. It is not just that we are exclusively God's, but we are, our attention is on him and then not, Oh, are my parents here? Are my friends here? Exactly. I'm still watching and notice again, what this brings up in our assumptions about what it would mean if we were laser focused on God. And I know again, in my own life and in the lives of people that I've met with, there's all kinds of assumptions that come to the surface when we start to examine these categories. And some of it's things like, well, then if I was laser focused on God, I would never have any fun. Right. And notice the implicit assumptions in that, that God is boring. Yeah. And for some of us, that's what lived experience has taught us through people or through organizations. I mean, this is what most children dread about church in some instances is church is boring. Therefore God must be boring. And so if I was going to be focused on God, man, just prepare for the snooze fest. We're just going to be singing like monastic chants all day long and forget anything fun. Right. And we have to allow these heart level beliefs to be surfaced and for God to address them. Right. And one of the things that cracks me up about God is that God is fun. Yeah. God is fun. I mean, Jesus on the day of his resurrection, according to the gospel of John, goes and pulls a practical joke on his buddies. Yeah. All right. He's on the beach. His friends are all out in the water fishing and sad, and he makes a joke. Yeah. Have you caught anything? Yeah. Try fishing on the other side, which is a throwback. He brings the joke around from the beginning of the gospels when he first encountered them. And that's how they know him. And here's the punchline for me. Peter jumps out of the boat, swims to shore. The rest of them bring the ship in. They've got all these fish and Jesus has fish cooking. Yeah. Dude is funny. God is fun. Yeah. The road to Emmaus, right? God walks with two of his followers in disguise and not to torment them. Right. But to show them something new. Yeah. And then there's this playful, like, ta-da, it's me. Yeah. God is fun. Yeah. But notice these heart level convictions that have been able to persist in us that if I followed God, God's way, it would just mean loss. Yeah. It would just mean no fun. Yeah. Yeah. And we forget that Jesus promises us not just living, but thriving. Yeah. He says abundant life. Yeah. In some translations, overflowing life. Yeah. Or life to the fullest, you know, depending upon which particular translation you're reading. And in that sense of that, like, I think about David, you know, in the Psalms, he says, if we delight ourselves in the things of the Lord, he'll give us the desires of our heart. He will satisfy our longings. All of the biblical writers, in some way, shape, or form, talk about the satisfaction that is theirs because of what God does in them. We forget that. We think, oh, well, God is, I keep going back in my mind to, I believe it's a Wendy's commercial back in the 80s, you know, Sven Bear, very nice. You know, it's the Soviet bloc, German, austere, everything's gray. And, you know, and again, the thing is, and the point was, you know, that there's an austerity about life and it's not fun and it's gray and it's not interesting, has no flavor and all that. And we do that to God. We look at God as that German taskmaster, you know, your life, very nice. You know, it's gray and dull. But what Jesus says is, I've come to put the color in life. Yeah. I've come to put the flavor in food. I've, he shows up, his first miracle is at a wedding and he makes wine. And what kind of wine does he make? The best. I mean, so, and a lot of it, and a lot of it. Yes. And, and I, and we miss that about, this is what God has come to do, which, you know, you circle all the way back up to, I commit to go God's way. God's way is not so that he can pull the color out and take the flavor out. God's way is because he knows exactly how we work. And he knows that if you go the way I'm telling you, flowers are prettier. Birds sing sweeter, food tastes better. Laughter is deeper. Just go down the litany of things because that's what our God came to do for us. And that's what a focused life produces. When we choose to go his way in his way, when we choose to say I'm all yours, he's not going to lead us to, to those places that are flavorless and colorless. He's leading us to places of rich abundance. I mean, we could spend the rest of this podcast and another one in kind, just talking about places in scripture where that's illustrated, you know, because over and over and over, God says, look, I am here to make it better. I will, if you'll go my way, what you long for will be satisfied. Yeah. It's the benediction that Brian closes most every service with. Measurably more. Than we could ask for. Yes. Or imagine. Yes. Yeah. So, Lee, you talked about two other aspects of reordered. And the next one being a reordered life gives the first and best to God. I know this is always a little bit of a tricky time to talk to people about their stuff, but there is also, again, if you look at this in whole, this isn't about the what, this is about the how. And so talk a little bit about where you were going with this idea of when God begins to reorder, there is this aspect of a reordered life gives the first and best to God. Yeah. I mean, there's just this, I don't know if it's truly an axiom. We know this kind of in our core of our brains. We do what we want to do. You know, we have time for what we care about. We have resource for what we care about. And it usually gets our first attention. It does. And so that's a reality about us as human beings. And so beneath this first and best to God has to do with our passion. And I'm not in the message. I don't drill down very deep on that. But the reality is that, look, if I'm in love with God, like the first cut is not the last cut. And I know in my own life, the tendency to not do that, like the tendency to pay my bills and fund my entertainment and give God what's left. Yeah. Right. And that, again, the dicey part of it is people go, oh, the church is always talking about money. And you're going to, if you're not careful, interpret this as a money conversation. It's not a money conversation. It is so much more. It's an exclusivity conversation. Am I really fully his? And if I'm fully his and I'm fully focused on him, he's my obsession in the best way of that word or best instance of that word. And if that's true, then he gets first. The first thing I think about is, okay, God, how can you have the best of my energy? How can you have the best of my talent? How can you have the best of my thoughts? How can you have the best of my... Get it out of money. I mean, just think about all of the assets that are a part of who I am and he gets the first and the best. And then we operate in the other areas of our life out of what remains after I've given him that. And, and again, I, I, I look at my own life and go, okay, I'm growing in this, you know, and there are places where I can go, okay, yeah, I've settled that. And I've created disciplines that make sure, but then there are other places where, yeah, you know what? He didn't get the best there or he didn't get the first, you know, I, I waited until all was spent and I don't mean money, but all of my talent or all of my creativity or all of my energy or all of my passion, it was all spent. And then offered him my worship, you know, and so, you know, in a lot of ways we invite God into our life and then serve him leftovers, you know, and, and there's, I got plenty of illustrations about it. Like I, you know, a little stupid, silly, funny illustration, you know people in a church that I was in used to, um, provide for God's work, uh, by, by sending resources out of their cabinets. And somebody showed up one day with tea bags that had been used and their statement was it's only been used once. So let's send it to them. They can give it, then give us up. Yeah. And we do that with God. We're sending him a used tea bag. Yeah. There's still some tea in here. You got to brew it a little longer, but here God, you can have it. See what you can make out of it. You know, and instead of saying, God, you know, it's all yours and it's yours first. And then I'll work with what you donate. Yeah. And I love that again, that the commitment by God's people in this section of Nehemiah is to do it God's way. Yeah. Right. This wasn't their commitment to, we think that this is a generous plan. And so hopefully God's on board. It's, we went back and looked and this is what God said we should do with our passions, with our resources is that this is, this is God's way to follow God. And yeah, and I've got my own stories with this, but I realized that the root of all of my stories as well are some version of God. I just don't think your plan works. Right. When push comes to shove, that's it. Anytime that I'm looking for a lower level of commitment, it's rooted in some version of God. I just don't, I disagree. I don't think your plan works. Right. And so I, I used to do that, you know, I'll talk specifically about money for me. I was not on board with the concept of tithing at all. Yeah. And I fought tooth and nail to hold onto my hundred percent of, of mine. And God started to chip away at this and, and he was so very kind and gracious to bring me through a progression of, of getting to the heart. Because again, it wasn't about what we were doing. It was how we were doing it because my initial progression was fine. I'll start cutting out 10%, but I'm going to do with it what I want. I'm going to find places where I want to give it to, or we'll go out to dinner, Brooke and I, and we'll just leave a crazy, nice tip for somebody. And then we'll sneak out the door and then look back through the window to see what happened. Right. Yeah. So, or even pick the ministry that I want to invest in. Exactly. Yeah. Right. Right. I'll follow your rule, but I'll do it my way. I'll do the what, but the how is up to me. And it took me longer than I'm proud of and longer than I would have liked it to have taken to get to a heart level place of this is yours. And I love you so much that I want to do this your way and trust that, you know, what you're talking about and that your plan does work. It's changed my life. It's one of the top three places spiritually that radically altered my relationship with God and the way that I live my life. And again, it wasn't about the, what it wasn't about just stroking a check. Not that anybody does that anymore, but it was the way the heart level reality that changed. Cause you know what? Ball still went in the basket, but the way it got there changed. And that made all the difference. I've got my, a similar kind of story around money that I'm happy to talk about where for me, the big shift was it, the first cut that, so the first lesson for me that, that, that was important because I would sit down with my money and go, okay, well, I need to pay my bills. I need to get a new car. I need to, you know, and here's the thing now I just need to make sure I leave 10% in the account so that I can give God his check. We'll make sure we get through this first. Exactly. Exactly. And if, if it happens to be that I had an unexpected medical bill or I had, you know, water heater went out and I had to replace the water heater. Well, I can always cut into the God's part, you know, cause it's still there. And he'll forgive me. Exactly. And when I made the change of the first amount of money I give is to God and it's unrestrained. It's to God. And then I figure out how to make my life work on what's left after that, that shift was life changing for me. And, and so for me, it was the first side of it that just saying, you know what he does that. And I, I'm going to tell the story when I preach the sermon, but I'm going to, I'm going to talk about that with time. I'm going to illustrate with time and not money. And so if you haven't listened to the message, you can go back and hear the story about days off and, and what that looks like and, and how God gets the first, not what's left. Exactly. So leave this last one. I know this is one that you definitely are excited to talk about. And this is often the case we get to the end and we're like, well, there's two minutes. Talk about the most important point. Um, when, as we were just joking, uh, before we hit record, like this is always the challenge. There's so much more. That's right. Uh, but the last point you were making was that a reordered life as a life lived under divine appointment. Yeah. And so talk about that. Oh man. Yeah. This, we could, again, we could get long on this and I promise I won't, but, but, uh, so when you turn the corner into chapter 11, the people are being, uh, relocated and it's striking to me that the relocation is assigned. Like, yeah, people have to leave farms, leave homes, leave livelihood to move because they have to rehabilitate Jerusalem that has been vacated because of the disrepair and they cast lots. And that idea of casting lots is, is the Bible's way of saying, they said, God, who do you want to go? And God makes a divine appointment through that process. We can get into how the lots were cast and all that. That's a tedious, uh, not relevant, um, piece of information as a whole, but we could get into that at some other point in time. But, but the notion that, that God has appointed the times and places and God, where do you want me? And, and it's a striking moment that finishes the vow. They write the vow and here are the four things in a reordered life. But here came the fifth that was, if I'm exclusively his, if I'm going God's way, I'm going to be obedient to him. If I'm focused on him and he gets the first and the best, it also means that I live my life knowing that he is the sole pilot, not just he's the pilot and I'm the co-pilot or in many ways I'm the pilot. God's my co-pilot. I've seen that bumper sticker. He's the sole pilot and he calls the shots. And I need to live with this sense of there is a divine appointment about every part of my life. So now that has a whole new way of living that I'm interacting with a waiter at a, or a waitress or server, I guess is the right term. I'm, I'm interacting with a server and, and I sense this is a divine appointment and that gives a sacredness to that exchange and, and, and puts me in a place where I'm saying, okay, God, you know, in my mind is this is going on. Okay, God, where are you taking this? And where do you want me to go in this? I remember in a very practical way. I was, I was in a pizza place in New York city and I'd gone to the place because I knew the history of the building and it had some particular affection in my heart because it used to be a church and my mother had sung on the stage in the building. And, and so, and the stage was still there. So it was like, this is really cool. So I was really excited about going there in the years between when it was a church and when it became a pizza place, it had gone through a variety of iterations in terms of what it was. And at one point it was vacant and homeless people had occupied it and there were all kinds of legends and stories about it. So we were sitting at waiting on pizza and server comes up. We're having a conversation with a server. And I just said something about, you know, do you know anything about the history of this building? And he started telling me what he knew. And, and it was one of those moments where I went, this is a divine appointment. This is, God has put me here for this conversation. And what proceeded to happen as I engaged with the conversation with this guy was I got to tell him that at the, at its origin, this place was a place of God and that God was celebrated and focused on and sung about and proclaimed from this place as a lighthouse to New York city. And he then began to tell me why he needed me to be there at that point in time for that conversation. I'm confident, not just convinced, confident that that's how God wants our lives to be lived. That every moment of our life is a divine appointment. Some evangelistic, some therapeutic, some encouraging, some provisional. I mean, there are lots of assignments within the appointment, but a reordered life, a sanctified life that's set apart for God is a life that says, okay, every moment, God, my ears are open. You direct. I want to hear what you say. And I want to, I want to be where you want me because you have appointed me for such a time as this. And that's really the beauty of this last point is I think this is what most people that profess a belief in God believe about God is that God is the one who's orchestrating their steps, right? This is what I hear so often. You know, I hear about this was such a God thing. That was such a God thing, right? These divine appointments that pop up. And so it begs the question, do you want God to be leading you to those? Or do you want God to be manipulating you to those? Right? Is this, I've given you control of my life. You are the sole pilot. Or is this, I'm driving the car and Jesus is my co-pilot and he's secretly taking me to places, even though I'm trying to get someplace else. He's like the driver's head is straight. He's got his foot on the brake. And this is the tension that I think we have to be far more honest about than in some cases we had before. And it makes me think of a mentor of mine that I learned a lot from in this particular conversation specifically because he had said, you know, John, it took me a while to get on board with this idea of truly letting God lead my life of asking him for direction and then listening and trusting what I heard and doing it. He said, because I was a hundred percent convinced that if I did, God was going to send me to some far flung part of the world and he was going to take away my house. He was going to take away my job. He might even take away my family and he turned me into a missionary in some place I've never heard of with a language I don't speak because that's what God would do. And we proceed to have a conversation about just what him wrestling through that revealed at a heart level of, I say all these things about God. I know all these things about God and I am actively resisting the divine appointments in my life because of who I am convinced at core. God really is. And then it also makes me think of a prayer that I heard another pastor say that he had started to pray at one point and it really messed him up because it revealed a lot of these deep things. And it was, it was very simply this. He would pray, God, I want more of you at any price. Yeah. And as he prayed that and he was telling the story. And so then I started praying that prayer and all these same things started coming up in me of these places in my heart that really just believe that God's not the one who gives God's the one who takes away that. If I let be, if I let God be the pilot of my life, that he might not send me to some far flung place in the world, but he's going to make my life uncomfortable when I want to make it comfortable. He's going to make my life unknown when I want to make it known and safe. He's going to make it out of my control when I'm so desperately fighting for control every moment of my life, which is an illusion anyway. Right. Right. And again, it's the, Oh, there's all these God moments and look what God did. Am I fighting him for the steering wheel? Right, right. Or have I happily gotten into the passenger seat and kicked my feet up on the dash gone God, you're the God of the universe. And whether it's a pizza place in New York or someplace halfway around the world. Yeah. I want to go where you're going because that's where life is. It's not less than it's not sucking all the color and the flavor way. It's where the best of life is. And I want more of that at any cost. Yeah. And I know we filled up this podcast, you know, in our time, but that's what we do. But just the thought that maybe for me kind of wraps up my thoughts is, you know, I, you said the statement, we all would kind of say, I want God, I want a God led life, or I want my life to be led by God. And, and I think this divine appointment, living with this sense of a divine appointment and under a divine appointment is saying, I want a God led life, but in order to have a God led life, God has to lead my moments. Yeah. So the big picture that I want happens in the small pictures. And when we live there, I want to be in God moments where God leads, then we'll have a God led life. Yeah. And I'll leave that. It's always hard to leave it because there's always more to say. And that's the beauty of this life with God. That's the truth. He has invited us to a journey of a lifetime. Yeah. Overflowing life. And so it's no surprise that we routinely run over our time because there's so much more. So we will call this good here. And so Lee, always good to have you here. So great to be here. Thanks my friend. And to all of you, thank you for being on this journey with us. Thank you for being people that want more of a life with God and want to live a life with God, God's way. Yeah. And so take advantage of moments throughout this episode, hopefully, or now, as we get to the end, don't just rush onto the next episode or the next thing, but sit in this space and ask God some of these questions about how to follow God, God's way. How to not just follow God, God's way, but where the places in your life that aren't exclusively God's could become exclusively God's and what it would look like to not just have your life be exclusively God's, but to be focused on him and to not just be focused on him in obedience, but to give him the first and the best and to not just give him the first and the best of resources. But of control. Yeah. Because he has it anyway.
