Welcome back to the Faith Forward Podcast, John Ackerman, Brian Bales, and joining us today, Patty Broderick. That's right. We're going to get to an introduction of you in just a second, but I feel like I owe our loyal viewers at least, all 20 of you, an apology. 22, I think. 22. I think you're right. We don't want to miss the two. No, no. That's true. We've been absent a couple of weeks as we've been in this series on Sunday called Complicated, as we've been talking about what the church was supposed to look like and what the church oftentimes looks like. And frankly, just through a combination of factors, we've not done podcast episodes week to week. And so if you were looking for them and wondering if your phone was having a problem or your internet connection was having a problem or the church was having a problem, there were no problems. We just didn't have episodes, but we're excited to do this episode today, particularly because of what Brian, you and Patty are going to talk about Sunday morning. So would you mind introducing Patty and then talk a little bit about Sunday? Yeah, well, this is Dr. Patty Broderick. She doesn't always like to be introduced as Dr. Patty Broderick, but I think whenever we bring someone into the podcast, there's good questions like why this person for this subject or whatever it might be. And I'm going to talk more about the why in just a second. But I wanted to kind of just hit back a little bit on what John was talking about. We all know the name of this podcast is Faith Forward. How do we take our faith forward? And one of the strategic reasons of the first two weeks of Complicated we did not do a podcast called Faith Forward is because we wanted you to sit and to listen and go through the first two weeks before you try to take your faith forward. We felt it was very important. And so what we say all the time on this podcast is you could probably listen to this podcast in isolation and you will get stuff from it. Hopefully you will. But we do know that it works best in complement with what happens here at Christian Fellowship Church on a Sunday morning teaching gathering. And this particular topic that we're talking about today in the third week of the Complicated series is very much true because what we've been talking about in this series, if you've tuned in on Sunday, is whether intentionally or not the church, our church, the church at large, have too often, by commission or omission, been a source of pain instead of a source of beauty in people's life. That Jesus created this beautiful thing called the church, and too often we've made it anything but beautiful. And as a result, it does. It hurts people. And instead of helping and shepherding and discipling the people that the church is designed to do that, too often the opposite things have happened. And so week one, and listen, is a repentance week about us as a church, about the church as a whole, about our part in that. Week two is recognition about how some of this happens in important ways, and also repentance. And then week three, and this is where Patty joined me on Sunday to talk about it, was around this idea, okay, so the church, the specific church or general church, repents and asks for forgiveness. They walk through this process. That's the start. But just because they've done that doesn't mean that we don't have this sort of personal big lump of coal. We're still holding. When someone asks for forgiveness, when they repent, there's still some things that we have to process through, and how do we do it? And so I've had the privilege of being in ministry now for about 26 years, and I think about year six or so into it, people started feeling comfortable at some level coming to me for different sorts of lay counseling. First it started with premarital, then it started with I'm married and we're having issues, and it just kind of grew from there. There is one very particular area of dealing and working with people through hurt and difficulty and pain that I have a much more theoretical book knowledge than practical hands-on knowledge, and that is when it comes to church hurt. And the main reason I think that's so is because if the church is the one that has hurt you, if it's our church or me, I've done it, it's odd to come to me for counseling if it's something I've done, or come to me if it's something the church has done by omission or commission. But even if it's not been this church, Christian Fellowship Church, or me personally, I recognize that I represent something about the church, so it doesn't always feel a safe place. But that doesn't mean that there aren't places to go, and one particular person over very many years, and that you have been and had the opportunity, Patty, to meet with people and to counsel them, you have had the opportunity for them to begin to talk about their church hurt, begin to talk about their church pain. And I really want to take this moment to say, listen, we need people to walk through and process it with. And I don't necessarily think if it's with the church, the first faith-forward safe step to feel for you if you're struggling with church is to go to the church. I'm not saying it's bad. What I am saying though, God has made people like Patty to be in your life and to help you. And so I'm grateful. I said this on Sunday, I'll say it now. She's been instrumental in helping me get an idea and get my head better around what we've been talking about. And so we gathered together on Sunday and we said, okay, all right, if healing is possible this side of eternity, and we know it is, once these things of confession, repentance have happened, how do we get to walk through it? So we're going to go a little bit farther into that. So that was a very long introduction, but Patty, thanks for being here. I'm happy to be here. Thank you. Well, we hope. Well, sort of. I love the idea of this pre-podcast that she feels much more comfortable in a room without lights like this, talking to people one-on-one. So if she looks like she's on a hostage video, if you're watching this on YouTube, she just, this isn't her personal thing. We're not forcing her. She wants to be here. It's just not a comfort zone. They are not forcing me. Yeah, it probably wouldn't be good at all to create more church her talking about church her right in that way. So John, let's, let's get started. Yeah. So as always, the goal continues to be with the faith forward podcast to be eminently practical, right? How do we do the thing that we've talked about on Sunday? We've covered the what and the why. And what I loved about the conversation that the two of you are having on Sunday is it's already imminently practical, right? You're already helping people begin to uncover things inside of them and, and move forward in purposeful and intentional ways. And so we just wanted to continue that conversation here in this space. And so we're going to break this down across a few topics. The first step is identifying where we've been hurt, right? That's just standard practice. You have to know or where we start that over with a coherent thought and we just keep the cameras rolling for this. You all know that. Yeah. Um, awareness is not the same thing as healing. Awareness is not the same thing as freedom, but awareness is often a necessary start. And so we want to start by helping people to better identify the places where they've been hurt. And then to offer some hopefully helpful suggestions on how do we begin to care for those hurt places inside of us? How do we navigate the pain? And then finally, specifically on this topic of church hurt, what does it look like to engage with the church or to re-engage with the church? If I've been hurt by church in general, if I've been hurt by a particular church, what does it look like to still be an active member of the body of Christ some way, somehow? So we'll sort of kick off with when we talk about identifying the hurt, there's maybe two broad categories that we could think about that in. The people that are painfully aware of the hurt and the people that aren't. So Brian, Patty, as we talk about that category of the people that have their hurt buried so deep that they're largely unaware of it, what are some helpful ways that you all have seen to invite people, to help them feel like they have permission to investigate those places that maybe they've not wanted to take a look at for a while? I'll go with you first. I got some thoughts, but you're the expert of the three of us in this room. I never like that word. I know, I did it on purpose just to bring up some bad issues, but no, I'm just kidding. Well, one of the things that I really like to use is exactly what Brian was going over on Sunday, and that is the Matthew 11, 28 through 30. Come unto me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me. For I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. I think that this is helpful to know not only where to come with our hurts, but also to be able to analyze our hurts. Because if we're not feeling that rest, if we're feeling anxious, if we're feeling all kinds of emotions that don't fit with the circumstance, if we're feeling just explosiveness that is not appropriate for the situation, those are uncomfortable. That's an uncomfortable, that's an out of control feeling when things don't match. And so just being able to look at that and feel what's going on inside, open that up with the Lord, of course, because we have to, you know, he's the one who understands what's going on under here and what's going on in the subconscious and all of that, that we have no idea most of the time. Yeah. I love that. That's a good, like, really diagnostic thing to think through. One of the reasons I wanted you to go first is because of your background, but also because, you know, many people who listen to this podcast before know that John is the main guider of our conversation and writes a lot of this, and then we interact from that. But when I was reading this, I'm the person that didn't realize that I was hurt. You know, there's a cultural reference from a particular movie called Monty Python and the Holy Grail, where there's a guy who has his arm cut off the dark night, and he's like, oh, it's but a flesh wound, right? It's not that big a deal. Some of you may know that. I'm not suggesting that you go YouTube it, but it's a great case for this. Because for me, for me, I did not know for a very long time, both some church issues and in this series, I didn't talk about my own. I think everybody, whether you've been a pastor, a pastor's kid, have had some church hurt. But for me, for a long time, I would have been the person that didn't, would be largely unaware of the effects, wouldn't even know it until someone started painting out for me, Patty. Well, this doesn't line up with Matthew chapter 11, 28 through 30. There's nothing about this that feels restful. There's nothing about this that feels peaceful. It might feel normal. But dysfunction often feels normal, if that's all you really know, right? There was no comparison grid. And so that was super helpful, what you just brought up for me, because that's actually what happened in my life. Okay, well, you said you find yourself feeling anxious or inordinately, I don't know how you used it. This is how I said it. I would have inappropriate anger at inappropriate times, like that doesn't seem to match up with this. Why are you so upset about khaki pants or whatever random thing it might be? This is really isn't about pants, if that makes sense. And so I think that's a, it's a great way because I think it can be easy for people to say, how could people not know? How could people not know? Well, I didn't. And it's not like I didn't know things hadn't happened. I didn't know the deep effect. If you said, Hey, if things happen, sure. Are you okay? Sure. But a flesh wound, I've had worse. Right? So I love that. It's a real practical thing. Balancing up against Matthew chapter 11. What does that really show? Do you find yourself rest? Does it seem easy? Or does it just seem like so much work? And so yeah, I think that's great and inviting God into this process. And I think sometimes, you know, we've talked about in this series that sometimes we confuse God in the church, Jesus in the church. Jesus uses the church, but Jesus is not the church and the church represents Jesus, but the church is not Jesus, which is this idea that no matter how much the church has, maybe have hurt us, Jesus never will. And so he's still a safe place to go. You know, that's the gospel that he sacrificed and died for us in that if we know that, and we hold that to be true, it's going to fight against all those lies that the enemy tried to put in our life. Well, Jesus doesn't care about you now because of this. And I will tell you, I know myself, and I'm sure you've met yourself and you, yourself, and then people we've all talked to. There's a whole lot of people, including ourselves, that can buy into that belief really easy. But the truth is, when I get back to the gospel, if I believe this about Jesus, that he loved me enough to die for me, it's going to fight against every natural instinct or supernatural instinct that comes from the enemy in my life to say, well, now he's abandoned me or he wanted to hurt me. Because it just doesn't line up, right? And so for me, over and over again, the practical idea beyond, all right, what does this last with Matthew chapter 11 is, how does this, what I'm feeling, line up with what I truly believe about the gospel? And if it doesn't coincide, then I got to know there's some things that I'm feeling. I've got to invite Jesus in to tell me what's true and what's not. So hopefully, at least that's for me. And I think, you know, when they become aware, right, what do you say about this? You know, some people have their hurt on the surface. They may know it. They may not know it because I think we've all met people like, yeah, there's something they're carrying, whether they realize it or not. Some people do. And they might even be aware of, okay, I know where this came from. But just because, again, like you said, John, we're aware of what it is and what it came from. We don't know what to do with it. We talked a little bit about that. So Patty, how have you and your experience been sort of like some helpful ways to navigate known hurt? Because we use Jesus as a model. And when I say we, that was Patty. I was walking with the conversation because that's what you do with people. And I loved the first time I read what you said, I'm like, man, this is good stuff. If someone ever trusts me with church hurt, or by the way, any other thing, I'm totally stealing this model. It's wonderful because it points to Jesus. Right. Right. So navigating church hurt or any hurt, I think is as individualistic as the situation, as the case, as the person, as their background, as everything they bring to it. And actually, sometimes that's where we get ourselves in trouble, is we like to offer prescriptions that we're comfortable with, or that have worked for us, and without taking the time to see the heart of the person and the hurt of the person that comes to us. So I'm not really one to offer prescriptions for that. That's one of the reasons I started with Jesus, because I'm comfortable with him as a prescription. Yeah, no, he's the principle behind all the applications. Yes. And he's the one who knows our hearts at the deeper level. He's the one who can heal us and help us to move in the direction we need to move in. And he's not a prescription. He's a relation. He's a God. He's a human. He's a relational being that you can have a relationship with, and so you can bounce things off of, and you can learn about yourself, and learn about how to love, and how to navigate the hurt, and all of that. So I'm not a big prescription person, honestly. I feel like, John, we're like 15 minutes or so into the podcast, and without saying our second name of the podcast, what Patty's doing is telling people the second name of our podcast, right? Yeah, ask God. Ask God. And Patty, I love the way that you're describing the availability of Jesus, the availability of God to personally and uniquely navigate you through your pain, that this is not the Jesus Band-Aid, that in the name of Jesus, be healed self, and hopefully it just runs in the background like a computer process, but that this is a dynamic, interactive, personal journey with a living and active God who has very creative ideas and solutions to help us respond to the things that have uniquely and personally happened to us, and however similar they may seem to the things that have uniquely and personally happened to others, there is no prescription for everybody that's experienced church hurt. There is no prescription for everybody that's experienced any particular kind of hurt. There are things that have been helpful for some, and sometimes that's helpful for another, but at the end of the day, the best person to help you with your healing journey is Jesus, and the second best person to help you is someone that can help you connect with Jesus. Amen. Well, I think what you're highlighting there, if I'm following it correctly, is well-intentioned but actually unhelpful things that often happen when we engage. When we engage people as a prescriptive methodology, and I think that you were the author of the Prayer of Repentance that I did at the end of the first in the series, and you made this statement where instead of just engaging with people, we have sort of, if I get this correct, I'm just off the top of my head, we use scripture as sort of a Bible mandate, like instead of walking through it, which I think at first, someone could go, well, why is it ever bad to say, read scripture, right? It's not, but I think that goes to kind of what we're talking about in here when we become too prescriptive about how everything approaches. Sometimes we have unhelpful suggestions, right, that in some cases could actually heap more shame on people or more guilt because it's well-intentioned but not, and I don't know if you've ever experienced people coming in to talk to you or watching to where well-intentioned people have come into their lives and given things like, you know how you fix this, if you just read your Bible more, right, which no one's saying don't read your Bible, get that, but again, we remind ourselves the Bible contains the words of God. Jesus is the word of God. I'm not saying anything heretical here. If you have any questions, send it to faithforward at cfcyard.org. I will answer that question by saying this, is that what I'm saying is the Bible contains the words of God. What makes them powerful is the understanding of the power of the Holy Spirit through these words because the Pharisees read all the Old Testament, right, which we have, by the way, and they didn't get anything about Jesus, right, so we're understanding that difference, so a little clarification if I can. So anything that you've seen happen a lot or you feel like helpfully unhelpful suggestions, almost even maybe hurtful things have happened? Well, very much with a good heart people offer those kind of prescriptions and because they've worked for them or that sort of thing, so I want to say that first, that people are trying to help when they do this, but there can be an underpinning, honestly, of legalism or prosperity gospel or that kind of thing that says if you do this more, God will do that. He will take that away from you and, you know, that's the transactional thing that you talked about in your sermons a few months ago. That is, it's more than not true. It's devastating because people, if they believe that gospel, if they believe that if I do enough that God will give me the good and happy and comfortable life that I want, and then it falls apart, then of course they're in my office and trying to figure it out, like they don't know whether God is true, they don't know whether they can believe, like they feel like they've been, you know, sold a bag of goods and it's all wrong, it's all a lie, and so we have to sort it out, and so I really, I'm always, I can't tell you how many times in the counseling office that is what we are talking about. We are trying to sift apart what the real gospel is, the gospel of grace, and what that kind of prosperity gospel, that sort of legalism, that sort of framework that can become anxiety producing and really destructive in us because we're always trying to please God, or always trying to control God, or always trying to make our lives, you know, get some outcome that we want, and we just, that's not the way the gospel works. You know, I think one of the things that churches do accidentally, I've never met a church that's done it on purpose, but I think in looking at it is, when you mentioned grace, that can be very hurtful, is we preach a gospel of grace pre-conversion, pre-cross, and then post-conversion we preach a version that's something like this. We have to do, do, do, do, do to justify the grace that we had to become, right? The grace almost leaves the end. It becomes a gospel of earning, or proving worth of the grace that you received, which is just the other side of the coin of trying to earn your salvation. Now you're trying to say, I can't earn it, but now I have to justify it, and the justification doesn't come through our actions, it came through Jesus' actions in that way, and I could see that. I love to, your point of like, you know, I think when we think about prosperity gospel, John, it's really easy to think it through the very caricature nature of the people that we might see on the television who say, you know, give 20 bucks, you're going to get 50 bucks, and that's an oversimplification, but I think it often happens through the lens of finances, but you're pulling this out a little farther that it is just, it's the same sort of idea that we turn Jesus into a program. I do this, I'm supposed to get this, and if I don't get this, by the way, I must have done something wrong, which was, you know, the original fault of Job's friends. They did really, really well in the first week where they sat there and said nothing, just sat with them in their pain. It's when they began to then engage through a prosperity lens. Well, you must be getting negative because you must have been doing something wrong, and of course, what's amazing about Job's faith is Job didn't have Job, right? We have Job to go, that's not true, because we have the backstory, and even when Job had this interaction with God, Job never got the answer to the questions. God just said, this is who I am. God never said to Job that we know of, by the way, this was always going on in the background, right? This is who I am, and so there's something about even in the deepest part of healing that we recognize that what heals us isn't necessarily answers, not that they're bad, and this is my experience, is the fundamental understanding that Jesus is with us, even in the midst of the hardness, even in that way. So, okay, so I love how we're talking about some of this, but John, I know that you have a lot of people come into you many times and praying through and talking through, you know, and that's that process of, right, you see someone, they trust you, and you can see their hurt. How do we begin as people for other people, like if they come to us with their hurt, you know, your neighbor, your friend, your whatever, to begin to care for them? What does that look like? Yeah, so I'll offer a couple of things that I've noticed people seem to do a lot, and I did it too, and then Patty, you had mentioned a couple of things on Sunday morning that I'd love to hear more about, but a couple of things that I see people frequently do with their pain is either fall into the trap of time. It's been however long since this happened, I must be better now. It's been however long since this happened, I'm probably healed, right? They don't necessarily feel any difference. They're still struggling with a lot of the same things, but it's almost like the duration of time has diminished their ability to accept that they're still in pain. They treat the internal wound much like you would treat an external wound, right? It's been however long since I got a cut on my arm. I shouldn't be complaining about it two years later because it's probably healed. Well, we hear people say that, right? Time healed all wounds, which isn't true. Jesus heals all wounds, no matter how long it has or hasn't gone. Yeah, time can give you space for wounds to heal, but much like any other wound, time can allow a wound to fester and become infected and actually be worse than it was originally. So that's one of the things that I found it's helpful to invite people into a space of regardless of how much time has passed, you're still allowed to be in pain. The wound is still allowed to be there. It's not supposed to be magically gone because of time served. And then the other one that I've noticed, another trap that people fall into as they're trying to navigate the pain that they've now become aware of is the phrase, but I've already worked through that. Either because I've already prayed about it once or a few times. I've already said words of forgiveness once or a few times. I've already met with someone else once or a few times. And so it feels like I should be past it. It feels like I checked the box. And so I'm really confused as to why this is still seemingly affecting me because I did it. And so Patty, one of the things that you had said on Sunday, you were talking about inviting people to feel like their pain is valid and feeling empowered to do something with their pain. And so I'd love to hear from you a little bit more about what that looks like. Well, obviously we are referring to Jesus on Sunday that he feels our pain and he knows what it feels like to have intense church hurt. The very people that he was coming to love and to give everything for wound up, most of them rejecting him and then way worse, flogging him and killing him. So I do believe we have somebody that we can go to that understands injustice at a really deep level. And so I think he validates that. The thing that we wind up doing, and we do this with our children, we do this with our, especially, I don't want to be sexist here. Men struggle to do this with their wives. For the record, if it's true, it's not necessarily sexist. You know what I'm saying? If it's true, right? Yes. Because men tend to be more thinkers than feelers that it's hard for them to validate pain. I have to think about that for a second. Go ahead. Yes. Yes. See, I'm trying to make her feel more comfortable with a joke, but I'm just not. You're doing a really good job of invalidating me. That's what you're trying to do. Yes, it's the belief that we were created to have these feelings and that they are actually God's feelings in a lot of ways with injustices that happen to us. And that they make sense in so many ways. And so that doesn't, you know, then we don't know what to do with them. And so that's the struggle is that he can validate us, but then we don't know what to do with them. And so we have to believe that he empowers us as well, that the pain is meant to be in some way useful. I love how Paul talks about the thorn in his flesh and how he prayed for it to be gone. It doesn't mean thorns are comfortable. It means they're useful, because it causes us to come back to him over and over. Sometimes it shows us our weakness. And believe it or not, that is a strength, you know, that then we come to the right one, the one who is strength, and we come to him with our weakness and with our brokenness, and he can help us to get through it. So in many ways, I love to believe that the very things that have been often that, you know, Satan meant for evil, God can use for good in me and in my life and in his church and his kingdom. Yeah. And one of the things that I really like about what you're saying on this, this idea of validating pain and feeling empowered to do something with that pain, is I think sometimes people wrongly spiritualize their pain and feel like, well, Jesus suffered so much. What's my pain in comparison to that? I shouldn't, I shouldn't be as focused on my pain. My pain is nothing compared to his. And so I should just, you know, muscle up and move on with my life. This isn't that bad. Other people have it way worse. And what I hear you describing is that when we look at Jesus as the model, right, he's allowed to feel his pain, right? God validates his pain. God doesn't say to his son, buck up little camper, right? Jesus's pain is validated. And God gives Jesus the ability to be empowered in the midst of his pain. And that's the same invitation that's extended to us, that Jesus's invitation to us is not buck up little camper. It's not that bad. I went through worse. What you're describing is I know exactly how you feel. This is awful. It was never meant to be this way. Right. And there is something in this that is redeemable and redemptive. There is hope in this. There is a way out, but the way out is not through diminishment of what's happened to you. Right. So it's a both and. It's a both and. The pain is validated. It's very, very real. And God can use it. And that's a really powerful way to think about life. And I love the emphasis again, Patty, and both you and John are both reminding that we could hear through different channels, feel empowered and translate that as buck up little camper, use your own flesh. That is not what we're saying. Feel empowered because you have the power of the spirit in you as a believer who is able to help us in any of our weaknesses. And even if he says, okay, this particular thorn, which I've always loved the vagueness of that, just again, my belief that we're comparative in nature as people. And if we actually knew whether it was an eyesight problem from Paul or whether I've been in support groups like that believes a particular addiction or whatever, that's the beauty of it, that it applies anywhere. It's not necessarily about the thorn. It's about who can help you in your weakness. And that applies because he's able to do so much. Now, I know for me, this is something, you know, outside of church hurt that I have a chance to engage people with. John, I know it's true for you. I know this has to be true for you, Patty. Let's talk about forgiveness for a moment, right? Because if we're to take our faith forward, if we're to not move past it in a dismissive way that acts like it doesn't happen, but if we're able to gain what God wants to do in our lives through this, even though he doesn't bring it to grow us to look more like Jesus, forgiveness has to be a part of this. Man, that's deeply misunderstood many times. What do you feel first like for maybe that you hear from people that maybe misunderstands forgiveness? And then could you sort of maybe guide us in a more accurate way from some of those misunderstandings? I probably work, I would say 50% of my counseling is in forgiveness. Because it affects everything we do. It's like your spine, everything. If you have unforgiveness in your heart, in your life, even if you're trying to get rid of it and you don't feel like you can, it can affect everything. It can affect your relationships. It just affects so much. So I'm working with this all the time. And one of the things that I really like to help people to understand is that with forgiveness, what is it that we're really trying to do? We're trying to take ourselves off the throne, basically, because we have put ourselves emotionally between that person and God. And we have believed that somehow we can right this wrong emotionally by what we do emotionally with ourselves and right the wrong. And the truth is, I love to do this. There's a little thing I like to have people think of. If you're standing there with that person that hurts you before the throne of God, and you're standing there with them, and God says to you, what should I do to him? I love to think about that because truth is, most of us would be like, I have no idea. Maybe smite him a little bit. I don't know. I mean, yes, but there's this understanding of what I need, which is mercy. I need mercy. I need grace before that same throne. So I want that person to have it. But I also feel like there's a piece of justice that needs to happen because this is so wrong, what has happened. And so that's why emotionally, I'm not the person. I'm not the one to impart justice. God is. And it's really helpful for me to recognize if I can leave that between that person and God, I can free myself of emotionally trying to figure out what it means to impart justice in this situation. And I can let God do that piece. That doesn't mean I won't speak against things if things need to be spoken about, but that just means emotionally, I'm not in charge of it. The God of justice, the God of mercy, the God who knows exactly what that heart needs, He'll be in charge of it, and that to me is very restful to think of even as I release that. But it's not something you do like overnight. It's something because if you've been carrying it for a long time, you do it over, and you do it over, and you do it over. And going back to John, that struggle of, oh, I thought I visited this before. You know, I know my own personal life. I'm like, oh, I thought I was done with that. And then, you know, like a little mini earthquake happens in my life, and something falls off the shelf and lands in my hand. I was like, I thought I put that on the shelf, and it was done, and I could just look at it from far away. And I'm dealing with that. And I love the reminder, Patty, that you're giving us too. It's not, forgiveness isn't saying that what happened to you is okay. And I think that's something people misunderstand. But this idea, it's not minimizing, it's not condoning it. In fact, that's only even more hurtful if someone looks at the pain you've been through and somehow minimizes it intentionally or unintentionally. But it is allowing justice to be done by God and turning that over to Him. You know, it's hard to grasp, even harder to do, but it is the true path, faith-forward path, you know, in that way. So, I want to, like, in this last time together, part together, make this what I would like to say a challenging turn. Okay. So, if you were reading our notes, you'd see this bottom part that says in this section, preparing for future hurt, right? So, the reality of it is, is that we live in a fallen, broken world. In this side of eternity, hurt is going to happen. We certainly hope that people are trying to walk in the Spirit enough that it's never intentional. Sometimes, unfortunately, it is. But even if we took the idea of intentional hurt off the table, not possible, because we're different people, because we're in different levels of sanctification, we don't know everything, we hurt people by accident all the time. And so, what does that mean, then, to say, even if I've walked through this moment, how do I prepare for future hurt? Whether or not we would say future hurt is about the same thing again, like, oh, I've got to reach forgiveness again, like it's almost re-hurting. I don't know if that's the right term or revisiting the hurt. Or someone else does it, right? Someone else in a church, someone else in our family, whatever it might be. Again, it's connected, so to speak, for forgiveness, what it means and doesn't mean. I think, you know, when we think about preparing for future hurt, sometimes people think if it's about a specific person, oh, that means I have to now reconcile with them, which, pick one, you guys. I know you both talk a lot about the difference between reconciliation and forgiveness. They are not the same thing. For me, I don't even put them as opposite sides of the same coin. I put them as completely different coins. Is that fair? You can tell me it's not fair if you didn't think it was fair. I totally agree. Yeah, so what are some helpful responses for people who's like, all right, if the church is, for example, God's best design for where we can experience Jesus, not the only place. As I said two weeks ago, you can do surgery out in a battlefield. Most surgeons prefer the hospital, right? But it can be done. Jesus can do anything. That means at some point, it's probably good that we walk in church community again, even as hard as it was. I just met someone this week who was talking about this series and said, I was hurt by church, and I didn't go to church for seven years. And it's still in me this moment hard and difficult. And while I appreciate what we're talking about, it's having me revisit some things again. So what are some helpful things that you've experienced, either one of you? Well, I think one of the things that you brought up, I think it was last Sunday, was to guard your heart. And when I think about guarding our hearts after having church hurt, that means being able to keep a soft heart, not developing a heart of stone. Because it's amazing to me, from the forgiveness work that I've done, how much we become like those we cannot forgive. And our hearts become hardened, or we become self-protective, and all these things. And now there's room for wisdom and reconciliation. I'm not talking about that portion. I'm talking about our hearts, and how we can still care for people, and how we can love people that are broken like us, that both have the image of God in them. So there's beauty, and they're broken, so there's a mess in every person that we come up against. And how can we still love? And how can we minister to that church? And how can we be the body of Christ? And how can we bring Him the glory that He's due? And that requires a soft heart, because even on the cross, His heart was still soft. So I really believe that there's strength. It's like everything with Jesus. It's the opposite of what we think is going to be strength. Strength is going to be like, buck up, like you said, and have the hard heart. No, I think it's the softness that actually makes us the church, that makes us His body, that looks like Him. What do you think, John? Totally agree. And I love what you were saying about, because it feels so intuitive. The best way to protect myself from being hurt is to harden, to shield, to armor up, to build a wall, to make sure that somebody else can't get in and do to me what was done before. And it just doesn't work. The hurt still finds a way to get in, and the wall actually seems to do a better job of keeping good things out than bad things. And the fact that the hurt keeps getting in, usually then the logical things to do is, well, let me build the wall higher. Let me build the wall thicker. Let me put on more armor. And the hurt somehow still seems to get in, and more of the good is blocked out. And it's just, it's this destructive downward spiral. And so I completely agree wholeheartedly that guarding your heart is not hardening, it's softening. And then at the same time, like you said earlier, there's no prescription for this. Because in some cases, the place where you're engaging that's causing the hurt may not actually be the place that you need to continue to engage. And so while you do need to navigate, you know, the internal hurt, you need to navigate the forgiveness between you and God. You don't necessarily have to keep putting yourself into positions to continue to be hurt. And at the same time, if you're looking for the place where no one ever hurts you, it doesn't exist. Because you live in a fallen, broken world full of fallen, broken people. And so there does have to be, through God's guidance, which is always the best resort, an ability to find the place where God has called you, and an ability to navigate the place where God has called you to, with a soft heart rather than a hardened heart, with an ability to forgive the people around you that are hopefully primarily unintentionally causing the hurt. And again, there's just, there's no step one, two, three, for those things like that. And we could sit here and pontificate on, well, here's what you could do, and here's what you could do. But the situations that we all find ourselves in are as varied as the people that we would talk to. And so it would probably be unhelpful for us to say, well, here's what you should do. If you're having problems with church hurt, you should do this, and then do this, and then do this. Because that may be exactly the wrong thing to do in your particular situation. So it brings us back around to our favorite phrase, ask God. But we know also that God designed us to be in connection with each other, even as He designed us to be in connection with Him. And so the answer is rarely isolate yourself completely, cut yourself off. That may be the answer for a short time as part of your healing process, but I feel fairly confident in saying that's never the long-term solution, is to avoid all connection with community, avoid all attachment to any church, any place, anywhere, that you were designed to be part of a body of believers as a Christ follower. And part of belonging to a body of believers as a Christ follower is navigating the parts where we get it wrong. That's hard. Yeah. Well, and I think that also in the very fact of talking about navigating parts where we get it wrong requires what I would like to say, maybe an admission that sometimes we don't want. Because I know that lots of times when I am the recipient of my hurt, it's difficult for me to maybe sit back and look with the help of God, if I don't ask Him, to where, okay, where was I the deliverer of the hurt? Maybe not to the very person that hurt me, but then understanding those times where, for example, I may have done it for omission. I know that my heart, I wish that person would show grace to me, right? And then certainly then sending ourself back in Jesus, this idea that there's no amount of grace that He asks us to show that we haven't been shown already. And again, I want to make this clear, that's not the same thing as reconciliation. That's not just going to back in a scenario at a church that says, thank you, may I have another. That's not what this is saying, but it is understanding our failure, as I said last week, our failure to understand grace or our ability to understand grace is intrinsically connected to how we are ministers of grace to others. And for me, becoming a student here is what we wrote of our own grace and the amount of grace I've received has been so much more helpful for me. I wish I could say it's been a perfect, and it is actually, by the way, perfect if I could do it perfect, right? So it's not a lack of this, but understanding the grace, understanding Jesus at that level, I think that that multiply changes us as we kind of make our way to the end, Patty. If there's someone listening to us today, and there are at some point, whether it's 22 or 222, we always joke about that, but could you maybe just take a moment to just speak from your heart about the power of Jesus and for them and the hope that comes, as not only you know theoretically, right, because we can read in the Bible, we know it's true, but sometimes we think, oh, that works for people here, but practically, as you've worked with people day in and day out for many, many, many years. Yes, those of us who over the years and through the pain and through the thorns have seen ourselves and what the destruction we can reap on this earth and in the church and in our families apart from Him, and then learning how to rely on Him that all of the fullness of the fruit of His Spirit can be evident in us, and He can make those changes in us, and there is hope for us to be beautiful like Him, and I love that as everything else atrophies in me, that that portion of myself, that spirit in myself of Him can grow bigger and bigger daily, and that is such a hopeful message. No matter what kind of hurt I've been through, the people that I've been, I've sat with, that is a hopeful message that even if we're in on terminal, in our beds, you know, and have a terminal illness, that can still happen. That growth can still happen in us. That's a good word. So, Patty, thanks for being here. I know you're not here to talk about what you specifically do in your specific ministry that you have, but it definitely strikes me that there may be some people that are listening online on Sunday because Jesus they love, the church are still struggling with, so they're not coming in for that particular reason, and listening to this podcast and waiting, and God's used you in this moment to connect with Him. We always give a way to talk to John and I. If someone wanted to reach you personally, what would be the best way to do that? That would be through my website, redeemedway.com. Redeemedway.com. Thanks. I appreciate your friendship. I appreciate your wisdom. I appreciate your willingness to share it, even in a hostage video, and I appreciate the guidance you've given me personally as we attempt to walk through this very complicated relationship that exists between Jesus, the church, and me, and you, and you, and anyone else who's listening. So, John, we say this often, but man, we go another hour or two. We're not sure people would hang with us, but so it's just been good. It has. It has. And as we often say, thank you for the invitation to be part of your journey. It truly is a privilege, and thank you for allowing us to be on our own journey, and thank you for joining us in that because we are all still very much in process. But, Patty, as you said, there's just so much available. There's still so much more, and we're excited to have more of us be experiencing more of what Jesus has to offer, and we're grateful that there's so many like-hearted people pursuing the same thing. So, on behalf of Patty and Brian, thank you all for being a part of this, and we'll see you next time.
