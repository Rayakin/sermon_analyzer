Hey, Faith Forward Podcast, this is Brooke Ackerman, long-time listener, first-time caller. Okay, so what God and I have been up to. It's been pretty fun lately, actually. In over several years, God has been redefining what it means for me to be his daughter. And it's really interesting to me because I have an amazing earthly father. And so it was really interesting to find out that I had learned my heavenly father wrong. There were things that I thought about his characteristics and his heart toward me that is just not true. The enemy has really helped along some lies over the years in my life. And God has just been redefining that and reframing things and showing me more and more who he says I am and who he is. And it's been really fun the last few years because God has brought me into some new adventures. And it's just been really interesting to see his kindness and his provision in drawing me out into something new and something that because it was new and the unknown, it felt a little scary to me at first. But he's just been so faithful and so kind. And I don't think I would have seen it this way had it not been, unfortunately, for several, several years of some difficult circumstances and difficult things in my heart that God and I have been dealing with. And it always makes me think of, you know, things like seasonal things. Like there's winter, but there's always spring and newness and growth. And even things that are seasonal, like farming, like we have a farm, small farm. We have a garden. And so, you know, there is time, there is a time where we have to prepare the garden. We have to plow the ground. We have to prepare it for planting. And then there's a time of tending the plants. And then there's a time of harvest. And I feel like God and I, over the past few years, have been doing a lot of preparing the ground, a lot of plowing, which is, oh, it's hard work. But then there was also a time of planting. And I feel like right now I'm in a time of harvesting with him. And he's showing me the growth and the fruit from the work that he and I have done together. And so it's been pretty fun. It's been pretty exciting. And, you know, I anticipate more seasons of plowing and planting and harvesting. And even though that's hard work, it's always good with him because there's always more. So welcome to the Faith Forward 100th episode celebration. We're just... Woo! Yeah, there's the... Yeah, exactly. We don't have the special effects for those of you watching on YouTube. Yeah. And post-production has failed me. So it is what it is. But we're so grateful to those of you that sent in stories about what God's doing in your life as you take your faith forward. Like we said, the goal of this episode was not to celebrate the podcast, but to celebrate you and to celebrate God and to celebrate what God is doing in the lives of people who are willing to take their faith forward, who are willing to be made uncomfortable, who are willing to be stretched, who are willing to take an adventure into the spiritual life with God and discover what he has for them. Because it isn't easy for that to happen. And so a lot of what you're going to hear in these next few moments are the people who said, hey, I want to publicly share my story. But behind... I just want to say this again. This isn't about celebrating the podcast and it's certainly not celebrating me or celebrating John. It's celebrating what God is doing in the lives of people and encouraging others by hearing their stories. But behind these stories, I can say personally, 20, 30, 40 more stories that I've just gotten from people, everything from, man, I really appreciated blank about blank on that podcast, to more. And I know the same as you. So certainly we couldn't get everyone to send it in because not everyone would send it in, but you can still send something in after this episode. We'd love to hear it. But for those, what you hear today, this is just some sampling of it. So according to your notes, John, it says, keep it short, two to three minutes introduction. We're at a minute and a half. We've done it. I don't think we've ever done that before. No, we've not. So first we want to say thank you to Amy and Karen for sending us this little video. And so I know some people access this as a true podcast. And so you won't get to see the video, but you'll hear the audio. Some people get the whole shebang. And so we're going to kick this off with Amy and Karen and saying thank you for the opportunity to share their story on this hundredth episode. Yeah. Good morning. Hello. I'm Amy. And I'm Karen. And we are admin here at CRC. And we're here to congratulate the Faith Forward podcast team on their hundredth episode. And Amy's wearing footballs because it's Super Bowl Sunday coming up. And Valentine's Day is coming up as well. So we thought we'd celebrate. We'll have some fun. But today we want to talk about the podcast and what we have gotten out of it and just share a little bit of that with you. And I love the podcast because I just think it gives you a space to go deeper in what is a fairly concise message weekly. Maybe you have questions. Maybe you want to think more about it. Maybe you want to bring it into the rest of your week and not just on Sunday morning. And I think it's very helpful to continue to think about the things that we're talking about as a church community. Yeah. And I have to agree with that. And I say too that your faith is your faith and you're responsible for it. And so you have to go deeper in some ways. And the podcast really helps you do that. John and Brian and Pastor Lee and Mike, they all really give you practical ways that you can apply the Bible and messages to your life. And so it's been a really great tool to have in our toolbox, if you will. So we look forward to seeing what God will do and continue to do with this great work. And congratulations again to the whole Faith Forward podcast team. Yay! Hey John, that was pretty good. I wonder if we should like talk to Amy and Karen to see if we can get them to do some post-production stuff. They seem very like excited. Absolutely. And their level of excitement for those that saw the video, I think was accurately reflected in their choice of headgear. That was super celebratory. So Amy and Karen, thank you so much for making sure that we got to celebrate the fact that, because again, like you said, we don't want to make it about the podcast, but we appreciated the fact that you wanted to celebrate the commitment to getting a hundred episodes on the air. I feel like it should come with a hundred episode flannel, just for the record. There we go. Yeah. We're recording this the same day as we actually recorded the physical hundredth episode. So it's not like, you know, John and I wear the same clothes all the time, even though I have been known, Kathy, my wife has looked at me and said, you wore that yesterday. And I'm like, yeah, but no one I'm seeing today saw it yesterday. So I'm fine. So I appreciate this. So celebratory flannels. We ought to think about that. I think so. That's a good idea. Yeah. Or like t-shirts that look like flannels or something like that. Maybe. Oh, there we go. Like a tuxedo t-shirt. Yeah, exactly. So we've got like two to three minutes, keeping it short up front that we said, yeah, I'm not doing that now. It's all wasted. It's all wasted now. Hey, I do want to though, to share an email that sent in from Elham and I'm just, you know, I'm going to read it to you, but I just have to say just how deeply grateful I am for when someone shares what God's doing in their life. And this, this is an example. My name is Elham and since April of 2023, CFC, Christian Fellowship Church, if you've been watching this podcast, this is where it originates from here in Ashburn. Christian Fellowship Church is my home church. I've been coming with my husband and two daughters and just thankful to Jesus for his guidance. So she goes on to say, my husband and I met Jesus 20 years ago while we were still in one of the Muslim countries. There's a lot of story back there as I've talked to her personally. I'm very grateful that I can see my kids getting to know Jesus' love for humanity and worshiping our Savior from childhood. My girls love Wednesday classes and looking forward to being back at church again on Sunday. One of the many blessings that I've received is that my two daughters, and she gives their ages, are learning about God in a fun, enthusiastic, and safe environment. They both pray in Jesus' name, which makes my heart sing. I often hear Holy Spirit talking to me through them. That's pretty awesome. I've been listening to Faith Forward as I've become a CFC member, and I started from the very first episodes, which by the way, that's some commitment. Thank you for that, because I know, I'm not sure how good we are now, but I definitely know how good we weren't at the first 100th episode for sure. So thank you for that. And she goes on to say, and learned a lot, the commute to work has been the time to meditate, chat with God, pause, and hear his voice. And she goes on to say, may our Lord bless you infinitely for the platform you provided that reminds me that I'm a child of God and welcome at his table and being his partner in this world. Second Corinthians chapter five, verse 17, she quotes it says, therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come. The old is gone. The new is here. All this is from God who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation. Then she goes on to say, my hope is in him because he will be back. And then she closes with Revelation chapter 21, verse four, which is just a great verse. If you don't recall that verse, I'm going to read it for you. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying. Neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away. Best regards. Thanks for that. Thanks for sharing it. And I hope if you've been listening or watching, however, it might be that you're encouraged because I know when I read this sort of stuff, this podcast, this celebration is not about us. It's about God. But when we talk about, we've been talking about what it means to encourage and walk and show our stories in the last several episodes and knowing and growing things when I read this, these are the types of things that say, Hey, I'm, I'm, I'm glad whatever the amount of time we've done to do this is reaching because, you know, there's this whole parable about one in the 99, it's worth it. You know, that was about salvation, but even in moments like this, it's, it's powerful stuff. Yeah, absolutely. So I've got another letter here from Jenny and she says, what's happened since I've tried to walk my faith forward? Well, just like back in 2022. And so talking about how there's just this continuity of experience, I feel drawn to worship even more. Because God is constantly sending me songs about how much he loves me, how much he treasures me and wants me, how he's always with me. I mean, right here, he's with me so that I can feel his love. That's what God's been telling me. Jenny, thank you so much for sharing that story with us. And I mean, just like we were talking about in the hundredth episode that we just recorded, that's really what this is all about is closeness with God. Yeah. Knowing the extent to which God loves us and we get to love God. That's not a one-time experience. That's a lifetime experience. And so I love Jenny that you're sharing the story of what that's been looking like for two years now. And Jenny, just thank you for the times that when you share the story, and just not here, but also in the emails that you send and I've heard the podcast, I know you have, and maybe you have, John and I love to talk about music. And one of the unique gifts that you have, Jenny, that you share with us is sharing music that God has placed in your heart. And so there's many times that God has used you just at the right time to send me something to encourage my heart. And so it's awesome to know that we had a chance to encourage your heart. So all right. So this next sort of audio clip, when I listened to it the first time, to be honest, John, it really just caught me a little off guard because they say for two years, and two years is a long time that they've been listening and going through this, and it's long for lots of reasons. I could jokingly say it's long because if, you know, the two of us were doing the talking, but it really is an understanding of what God can do over a period of time in comparison to when we talk over time, it's microwave. So I hope as you listen to this, you're encouraged. I know that I am encouraged by what I'm about to hear because I've already heard it. Now it's your opportunity. Hi, I wanted to thank you for the podcast. I absolutely love it. And I've been a devout listener for two years. So two years ago, I was at a point in my life where I had a relationship with God, but I just felt like I wasn't growing anymore. And I would listen to your podcast to understand the sermons on a deeper level. And I also started attending classes at CFC. And as you often mention, God is always inviting us to experience more of him. So I started putting into practice what I was learning, and that for me looked like understanding my identity and learning how to discern God's voice. And I would start asking God what he wanted to show me. And my relationship with him transformed into something I didn't even know was possible. It's been completely different and exciting now. And God is always revealing more and more of himself. And he's also showing me all of the different ways that he cares for me and sees me. And with a lot of patience, God started to reveal to me the areas that he wanted me to work on. And although this can be really hard, this has been my favorite part because as I grow in him, it's given me greater insight into who I am in Christ. And that's given me greater confidence in him. So every time that God has asked me to surrender parts of myself to him that he wants to work on, I find it easier and easier to do because I know God will come in and he will heal and restore me in those areas if he's asking me to do it. And something else that I didn't expect is as I gain greater perspective, he has also given me a greater capacity to really show up for and love other people in my life. So it's changing the way I perceive the world and relate to others. And God is always just transforming the way I think and the way I feel. And I know now that if I want to have peace and joy in all circumstances, I see how deeply I really need God. And I feel so blessed that I can go to him as my wise counselor whenever I want. And I wouldn't train the way I live now for anything. So I just wanted to thank you again because I learned all of this from you. And for many years, I felt like I needed something deeper. And this podcast is what opened that door and has had such a profound impact on me. And it's something I've been seeking my whole life. So thank you so much for all of the years of hard work that you've put into this. I'm very grateful. All right, so now I'm reflecting upon my reflections already of my reflections of hearing that if that made sense. But this idea of growing in our identity, that's fundamentally something that you and I both, whether we verbally talk about it or we imply it in here just over and over again have been transformed by personally, that when we understand who God has made us to be, not just specifically as a child of God, which is enough, made with the image of God, which is enough, given the Holy Spirit of God in us, which is enough, but uniquely and perfectly made us to walk in the guessings and the things that he's made us so that we can make a difference in the world. And so the fact that God has used this platform in many ways, Samantha, to be with you on that journey, to help you understand more of how God has made you, that blows me away. It really does to be able to actually actively hear his voice and we talk second name of the podcast. We should have called this 100th episode, Ask God, because he is able to do immeasurably more both at the end of a lot of services, but it's true, not just physically the things that we see, but spiritually in the things that help us understand it greater and have deeper spiritual transformation levels, how you perceive the world, how you relate to others. When I just process that, it's powerful. So just thank you for sharing that. I know it matters. I know, John, we have another letter that the particular person wasn't necessarily anonymous to us, but wanted to just anonymously say that and share it with people if you would. So what is God doing in my life? He's renovating me and the demolition is messy. My husband and I were searching for a more meaningful relationship with God. We really thought we were going to have to leave this area to find it. And that was God's plan for us. After a long and disappointing journey to get out of Northern Virginia, those hopes were lost. We came to CFC in late fall 2021, broken and sort of numb, but here we were. We started attending Wednesday night classes and we were amazed by the content provided in those classes. We were having fun meeting new people, settling in and learning a lot. Looking back, we were still just checking the box while we loved it and learned a lot. The lessons weren't moving past the head to the heart because God's work hadn't transitioned yet. Fast forward several months, maybe a year. I was taught God wanted to and could speak to me. I always thought stuff like that was reserved for special people or just things that people said to make themselves sound more spiritual. Then I actually experienced God talking to me. The conversation came. I was amazed. It was wonderful. My heart started to wake up to so many truths that I never really understood about God and his word. It was like my eyes were open for the first time. It was glorious. That was the start of some new things. Some things I really enjoyed, like understanding more clearly how God saw me. Other things I would have gladly passed on. My eyes were open to some hard truths about myself. Things I didn't really want to see. I thought I had my world perfectly handled, everything was fine, and I was fine. I had myself convinced it was true. Learning I hadn't gotten it perfectly right meant failure to me, that I had failed. I spent my whole life trying not to fail, and still, I failed. It's been a hard and fast rollercoaster of waking up to reality, real reality, God's reality. The past year has been really difficult for me. God has been shaking things up by opening my eyes to all sorts of things I wrongly believed had mixed up, walled off, buried six feet under, or was completely unaware of. All failures in my mind. I felt emotions I hadn't let myself experience in decades. It was so uncomfortable. I stopped trying to talk to God as intentionally as before. It was a bit too much, too fast, too hard, so I tried to put on the brakes. On top of all the internal renovations, God plopped me into a role that I feel very unqualified for. Really, God? Now? Isn't all this other stuff hard enough? Don't you see me struggling? My heels dug in. Nope. No further. And then there is the ever-present whisper of the enemy. I can 100% relate to the Israelites wanting to go back to Egypt. At least they knew what to expect there. The temptation to turn back is real. I've always solidly known that God was and is in control, and his ways are always best. No question. I wanted God to have my whole heart. I was trying to give it to him. I never gave up on him. I just wasn't sitting down to have a conversation with him very often anymore because I was afraid of more failure, more pain, more anything. No more, please. Yet my lack of pursuing God didn't stop him from coming after me. My attitude didn't stop him from coming after me. My struggle and pain didn't stop him from coming after me. My arguing didn't stop him from coming after me. My fear didn't stop him from coming after me. My hiding didn't stop him from coming after me. He continued talking to me even when I wasn't intentionally talking to him. With my walls up, he spoke. He spoke to me through things I was reading, verses from the Bible, other people, songs, Instagram, and even as I was just living life, he would talk to me, relentless. When he would talk, I would recognize what he was doing. I see you, God. I would generally sigh at myself, thank him, and move on. Often he would talk to me a lot about a certain struggle, but in different ways. He was determined to break through. Sometimes depending on what he was saying to me, I felt like saying, leave me alone. But he continued to speak to my heart, to work and move, to show up and change me in spite of my pushback. I'd say, how rude, but God gets to do what he wants because he knows what's best, thankfully. I've seen the change in myself, good change, a softening, a shifting. That's what I generally keep to myself because it feels too new, too raw, too vulnerable. It's okay though. He's still working on me. I now have a confidence in God that goes deep into my soul, a peace that he is working it all out. I know I'm going to continue to push back because there's still a lot of junk inside of me that he wants to remove and it hurts. I know I'll still have attitude. I'll struggle with what he's asking me to do. I'll continue to feel like I'm failing the war with the enemy. But I know in my heart he'll bring me through. He hasn't let me turn back yet. Why would he start now? I used to feel bad about my resistance, my attitude, my pushback. Okay, I still kind of do, but I know he's going to fix that too. Actually I've come to realize that my pushback has caused God to give me more and more proof of what he's saying to me. So when it finally hits my heart, I fully own what he's been saying to me. I have an unwavering confidence in God that I never had before. He's restoring me. I've seen that I can't stop him or the changes he's making in me even if I try. Thank you God for relentlessly pursuing me and taking me through the process of saving me from myself. I'm really excited to move past this stage and see what's on the other side. I look forward to seeing where all of this struggle and restoring leads and I'm most excited to see how God uses me for his great glory. So what is God up to in my life? One answer is I have no idea. The other answer is teaching me to trust, obey, rest, rely on, have faith in, hang with him, lean into the productive struggle, and snuggle into him to find peace beyond understanding. Currently he's holding on for the both of us and I'm so thankful. I guess I found that deeper relationship with God after all. I think that says everything pretty much. Thanks for sharing that. You know, as we kind of close out this, you know, a little abbreviated episode where we're celebrating, I was trying to reflect in my own life, John, what God continues to do in me and I think one of the things that I'm grateful for is a community of the faithful that I can work out some things live. And so I can't tell you how many times, John, that we've been talking over the last hundred episodes as we were talking. God's like, yeah, we need to talk about that to me personally or would bring to light some truth through you or through someone else engaging that I needed to hear. And so for me, I think there's so many things I've grown at. But one of the things that I just want to say to everyone is that, you know, as the person who speaks the most on Sunday, who, you know, brings content that John then makes into what we do here, the Faith Forward podcast, I've not arrived when I've got here. I've not arrived. And by the way, even when I'm done, I've not arrived in these sort of things. And so thank you for the freedom of being what I like to see as a pastor, as an authentic of community that I've ever experienced to be able to say, here is where man, I'm just not there yet. And what God is working on in my life and let's do this together, because as we said over and over again, there's one thing to know what God wants us to do. It's another thing to obey. And so it's just the end of that letter was talking about, you know, still dig in. I still dig in, too. But thank you for being people who are patient with me, push me, pull me, whatever it might be. So just lots of things I could say. But you hear me talk every week. Yeah, I feel very similarly, which probably isn't surprising because I think both of us have recognized the reality that if you really want to try to learn something, try to teach it. And in the attempt at teaching, you will discover just how much you don't know and how much more there is to discover. And that's been the real joy of these hundred episodes so far is. God exposing all the opportunities for growth that still exist, giving little glimpses of. OK, now you see this now go live it. It's one thing to communicate it. It's another thing to experience it like we so often talked about. And I'm just so grateful for all of you. Providing the space for this community to exist. You know, I've said before, and I feel like it's true, if nobody watched, we'd probably still have these conversations. Yeah, no, but agreed because people watch. It motivates us to continue to have these conversations and not to sit in the seats of expertise and mastery and hold forth, but to sit in the seats of humility. And to offer and I love the way that that last letter talked about that the painful and the disruption as God continues to transform us and to show us just how much is available. And so I'm just I'm so grateful for the opportunities to practice what we try to offer. And that through your participation to want to continue to come back to the seat of, OK, God, what else? Yeah. What else do you have for me? Not just so that I can offer it, but so I can authentically experience it for myself. So now I don't really have anything else other than just again is what you've said again. Thank you. Thank you. And from my heart, if I don't bring anything, hopefully the thing that we bring is the second name of this podcast, the best wisdom we could ever share for all of us in this community is learn to ask God and learn to say yes to what he has. So that'll move all our faith forward. Yeah. So thank you again to those that sent in the stories of what God's doing in your life and for everyone else who has the stories of what God is doing in your life. Thank you for being the people that allow him to continue to author that story.
