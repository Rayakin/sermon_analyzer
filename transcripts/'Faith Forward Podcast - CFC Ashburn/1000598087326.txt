He's giving, in some ways, a theology of suffering, because if it's inevitable, shouldn't we understand a little bit better than what the purpose of it is? But he doesn't cover everything. He just doesn't cover everything. So if you're hearing this or you're watching this and you're like, well, you're really not addressing my particular area of suffering. We might at some point address it, but we might not. The good news is Jesus does somewhere in scripture. And if you don't know where that is, and you would like to talk to us about it, you can just, we'll say it up front. You can send us an email. We'd love to talk to you, faithforward at cfcywire.org. We might be able to walk with you through it or point you to a place that you can walk through it with a friend or certainly with God. He's there to walk through with you. Yeah. I actually ran into somebody in the church cafe a couple of days ago and they said, you guys should do an episode where people, you know, text you or email you questions and you answer them live. I'm like, that'd be great. We just need people to email us. Yes. So if you have questions, email them. Because I think in the history of the Faith Forward podcast, which is now episode, eh, high sixties, I've lost track of which one it is. I think we've gotten six emails and three of them were, I just really appreciate you guys doing this show. Yeah. So, and that wasn't even from my mom, which I was great to hear that. Thanks for watching mom. Yeah. So yeah, if you have questions, please, please, please send them. If you have questions specifically on suffering, specific circumstances, anything around this, we would love to hear from you and we would love to incorporate it, address it where appropriate as we can. Yep. So thank you for that. So this week you already gave us a little bit of a snapshot of where we've been and sort of where you're, you're going this particular Sunday. I'm gonna give you some space to flesh that out a little bit more in a second, if you want to. Sure. But again, as always, the goal is to be practical. And so we're going to talk through some more practical steps about engaging in suffering. And this week in particular, preparing for suffering, which that'll get people to run even further, but we know we're called to suffering. We know we're called to suffer. And so there's an element of this where we want to be prepared to suffer well. Yeah. You know, if, if suffering is inevitable, what scripture says there, there's some wisdom in preparing for it. I think many times because, you know, we don't want to think about it. It's not easy. We're unprepared or something. As I said on Sunday, there was at least three quick reasons I could come up with. One, everything has gone really well for a while that we forget that eventually it's not going to, or you've alluded to this already. It's gone really bad for so long. I just, I can't walk towards it. You know, I just, I want to put it away. Or the third thing is, is we'll talk about preparations. We often cease from doing the things that we should cease from doing and don't do the things that God asks us to do. Those are at least three. I'm sure there are more, but you know, that's what Peter's writing about. Suffering is inevitable. They were already suffering already in 80, 64 in the church at Turkey, but it was about to get a whole lot worse. This is inevitable. And so this call in preparations, this idea of allowing God to transform us, it works in an interesting way. We are transformed because of suffering. If we let the suffering do its job, but also the transformation prepares us to be able to get more suffering. And in fact, in many ways invites it, especially in that culture, which is kind of like, this is ironically bad. You're telling me in the answer to that is yes. And so it's this sort of tension, but acting like it doesn't exist, doesn't work any more than trying to jump off the top of the building and think you can flap your arms and outdo gravity. It will have its effect. So this, this idea of thinking about it through this lens of that, it's inevitable, but it does transform us and we need to be transformed to be better for accepting suffering in the future. But it's not without a purpose. Both by the way, for ourselves to make us more like Jesus, but also one of the main themes of this section of scripture, first Peter, it shows us the goodness and the glory of God. There is none that I can think of maybe, but none that have come to my mind that is a greater apologetic and apologetics, a big fancy word is testimony for or defense of a particular subject. So in my opinion, there's probably no greater apologetic for the truth of the gospel than suffering. Because when we're able to endorse suffering in the manner that God will equip us to do, if we receive it, people look at that and go, there's something about that that is not normal. That is alien and stranger. And it's attractive. It is one of those things that, that then invites the conversation, as it said in first Peter chapter three, we talked about last week to give an answer for the hope that you have. And I just, I've said this before, I don't like talking about this. I don't, because there is no intellectual way to really prepare for suffering. It's, it's almost completely and utterly experiential. We've got to go through it to be better at it and to be prepared for the future part. And so I don't like talking about it because I know I'm like, Hey, God, make me more like you that, that most likely this is going to happen. And so none of us wake up in this morning saying, bring me more suffering. This is not masochism, you know, but it is just a reality. And so we're going to kind of walk through some things about how we prepare, because that was that word arm yourself. Whenever that word is often used in the new Testament, the Greek, it is a word used in life and death situations. Right. And if you've been through any suffering before in your life, some of it has actually been real life and death situations and a whole lot of the rest of it has felt like it. Uh, and sometimes there's really not a lot of difference between what it feels like and what it physically is. And so how do we, how do we embrace this as a necessity of transformation instead of trying to be people who just live like it's not going to happen, even though it's inevitable. Yeah. And something you just said triggered a thought that I hadn't put down in our notes, but I feel it's, it's important. You talked about intellectually preparing for suffering. And I know for some people that what feels helpful, what feels like it gives them a sense of security, which really translates as a sense of control is worry, worry. Mentally preparing for worst case scenarios, because if I'm mentally prepared for it, then it won't hurt as much. And as someone who's followed that path for many number of years, it doesn't work. It is not practically helpful because it's still going to hurt and it's still going to hurt as much as it was going to. Unless your worry takes you to the place where you shut off your ability to feel the things that hurt, in which case you're actually worse off than you were before. And so as the, you know, step zero of the practical things we're going to talk about, Jesus is pretty clear in the gospels too, that worry doesn't help. That worrying about tomorrow is of no avail. It does you no good. And, and I've heard some people that I have a lot of respect for talk about what they lost when they spent so much time worrying. They lost so many good days when there wasn't suffering. Because they were mentally trying to prepare for suffering that seemed like it was going to be imminent, that was coming someday. And they said, as they look back on life, one of the things that they wished their future self could have traveled back in time and told their present self was, don't spend so much time worrying. Don't lose the good days for fear of what's coming. And the reason why we have the ability, if we so allow God to help us with, to do that is not because of something in us, but because who our, who our father is. And again, we didn't have this in our notes, but one of the things personally for me that has helped me, that reflection that you just mentioned, like, yeah, I've lost a lot of days waiting for the other shoe to drop. That's how I call it. Like, if I could just prepare for everything that's about to go wrong when it goes wrong, I won't be as suffering, but it does. That we take that, that mindset of worry and we move the object of the reflection of it is. And so I've said this before, people like, well, I don't know how to meditate on God. I don't have that sort of stuff. I'm like, yeah, you actually do. If you know how to worry, you know how to meditate. You're a pro. It's just the object of that process. And what does it look like when we learn? So maybe this is a real practical thing. We talk about suffering, this idea of like, what does it look like? Instead of worrying about what's to come or in the midst of take that, that mental energy, that reflection, that scenario building, and instead turn it towards God and reflect back on what we know about God, even in the midst of things that we don't understand that's going on in our lives. So we're going to talk in a little bit, as we get further down our list of things to cover today, we're going to talk a little bit more about preparing for suffering, but honestly didn't trust myself to remember it. By the time we got there. And so I wanted to throw that one out first, but where we're going to kick off is if you currently find yourself in a place of suffering, what we would call an emergency, you find yourself in emergency right now, because most emergencies have some element of suffering, of pain, of confusion, of frustration, of feeling out of control. And so we wanted to sort of touch on this in two ways that if you're in an emergency right now, if you're in an emergency of suffering, suffering has. Rather quickly come upon you and you weren't expecting it. You didn't see it coming and you find yourself there. Now, what do I do? And I don't know. I felt like God sort of brought this analogy to mind a little while back and was reminding me as I was looking at your notes and preparing for these notes was there's a difference between emergency and immaturity. That if you're driving home and it's late at night, the kind of late at night where stuff's closed, like you're, you're not finding a place to pull in and that check engine light comes on and that check engine light can mean a thousand and one different things. Yeah. Could be super mild. Could be your engines about to fall out of the car. I think that light means the same thing in that case. And, and you sort of throw up this prayer out of a lack of knowing what else to do. Lord, just help me get home. I don't know what else to do, Lord. I wasn't expecting this. I didn't plan for this. I can't do anything about it right now. Lord, just help me get home. That is a completely appropriate response to an emergency, to potential suffering. Lord, I don't know what to do. I'm not prepared for this. This is all of a sudden, help me get home. Great. Immaturity looks like this. Six months later, you pick me up and I look at your dash. And I noticed your check engine lights on. And I'm like, Hey, what's, what's up with that? You're like, I don't know. It came on six months ago while I was driving home one night and I prayed for the Lord to get me home and he did. So every day I've just been praying, Lord, get me home. And it's worked out great. I am getting out of your car at that point. And I'm calling an Uber because that's immaturity. That's not a healthy response to suffering. It's not a healthy response to preparing for suffering that we know is inevitable. Yeah. And so actually you're using that analogy. I had that happen to me. One time I had, um, a check engine light, come home, come on about nine 30 at night on the way home from a friend's house and nothing opened. So I pulled into my house and said, all right, God, please let it go away. But I woke up the next morning and said, all right, I need to take it from 25 miles an hour. Let me just drive it for five minutes. And the light was off. It's like, thank you, Jesus. And then I pulled into my driveway and the light came back on. It's like, all right, I'm getting towed. And by the way, the engine was falling out. They said, yeah, they did. They said that I had a shavings in my oil pan, which anyone who's heard about that knows there's a reason. It's long story, but I could have kept driving it because I asked them, okay, well, what happens if I just have you just flush the oil and put it back in? They said, well, because blah, dot, dot. And they answer all that, you know, your engine will just seize up at one point, stop working. I said, well, I get a warning. They're like, no, you won't. I said, so I could be in the middle of the left turn in traffic and he could just stop. And he was like, yep. I was like, well, that's not too smart. Right. And I think in this analogy, sometimes there's the initial thing that we're dealing with, but because our inability, unwillingness, or in some cases, just deep pain that we don't know how to process. Well, we just let that light and it leads to additional unnecessary suffering, things that Jesus wanted to step in. And again, notice I said unnecessary, God can use anything. Yeah, he can. He won't even waste that unnecessary, but it doesn't mean that it's God's always first plan, but also in the same way, God loves us enough both to bring that in, if that's what transforms us and also then allows us, if we respond well to, if we respond well to have that suffering, be a testimony for someone else, um, to know the goodness of God in our life. And so if you're an emergency right now, there's some, there's some things that we should do number one, right. And, um, so we're X amount of time into the podcast and, you know, again, the alternate name of faith forward podcast is right. Yeah. It's, it's ask God either that, or I still like there's never enough time. That's yeah, that's option C, but yeah. So, you know, unexpected financial emergency, right. You didn't see it coming, but you suddenly got laid off. There's suddenly a huge medical expense. There's suddenly a huge automotive expense. There's, you know, there, there's a tragic death and, and you're just suddenly overwhelmed with grief and sadness, right? And, and there was no way to predict this. There was no way to see this coming. You're just, you're in it. Step one, ask God, ask God what he wants to say to you right now, this moment today, and not just tactical words, not just God, what do I do and where do I go? But ask him to talk to you about who he is and who you are, how he sees you, even in this moment, how much he cares about you, because honestly, sometimes that's really what our heart needs the most is we need the warmth of God's embrace. Not the cold strategy of God's intellect and not that God's intellect is ever cold, but sometimes we just want solutions and we want steps and what God wants us to do is actually pause and take a look at how we're doing under the hood, below the surface, things like that. So if you're in an emergency right now, step one, ask God, not only for strategy, but for comfort. And then step two, then start saying, God, okay, assuming we can hear well, and we're going to talk about that in a second, because sometimes in the middle of pain, it's difficult to hear well from God, God, what is the source of this? And there are many different categories, but what I've discovered is, is that more times than not, there's categories aren't exclusive. So by that, I mean, this, you know, all right, God, is this the enemy? Is that why I'm suffering? Is this my own personal sin or is this pruning you're allowed in my life? Now, whenever anyone talks about suffering, eventually Job always comes up. And this is my opinion of Job, right? Some people look at Job as just the enemy and just pruning. Sure. I think there's some, at least in my theology, some middle ground when he's, when the way he's doubting God and in, when we get later to chapter 37 or so, where God basically takes chapter 38, 39, 40, and 41 to kind of say, Hey, where were you when I, so I do believe there's some sin there, right? Um, again, it didn't bring it on. That was his response that when we go and talk about the source, I do think that there are times where that God allows pruning into our life. And if we don't respond well, then it turns into our own issues, sin issues, right? Um, or, and then the enemy gets in our ear. I think there are times where the enemy gets in. I think there's a mixture in that. So it might be proper, not just to say, God, what is the source of this? It may be proper to say, God, what are the sources of this? And maybe just think practically as someone who wants to take their faith forward, just at minimum, go through those three, God, what is the enemy trying to do in this moment? What am I, what am I bringing in due to my choices to not follow you in the way that you want me to? What are you bringing in? Right. It might be one of the three. Yeah. My guess is it, there's going to be some sort of mixture in there. Um, maybe not, you know, maybe it's just God's bringing pruning and that's it. And that's okay. Yeah. Um, but don't sort of get stuck in that, but I think, you know, what do you do? How do you feel if then you're asking God and you're not really connecting well on that? Because as much as we talked about last week, that a lack of forgiveness or not proper to understanding forgiveness can really keep us from hearing God. Well, suffering really does. Yeah. Because, um, was it C.S. Lewis that talked about suffering as God's megaphone? Right. Well, that is true. That is true. But I also like to think that suffering, whether we like to admit it or not, our first tendency is allow suffering to be our earplugs. Oh yeah. You know, God's screaming through the suffering is, but because of our issues or our experiences, you know, we're throwing earplugs and it's really hard to hear, but there are other people around us. Um, that I hope that we all have in our life that we can invite into this moment, inviting to help us understand a little bit. Maybe they're able to hear from God a little bit better. We, we share this really practical all the time. We say, you know, God asks, ask for help. God will help us. That's what we ask God. One of the ways that God often helps us is by bringing other people in our life. And in fact, personally, I think there's been some times where God has brought some things in my life because what he wants to work on is to work on my independence. And while we don't think about that per se is sinning because we're Americans and we're supposed to be independent, the actuality is we're supposed to be dependent upon God and we're supposed to be dependent upon each other and community. That's part of the beauty of how he made us to work, to show the goodness of God. And so there wouldn't be surprising in my life. If there's a moment where God uses suffering, brings it in or whatever comes out of the way to say, all right, you're going to have to connect with other people. And there's some people, I just talked to someone recently that the last thing they wanted to do in the midst of their suffering was to feel like they're a burden on someone else. But then we've got to deal with this idea of Galatians when it says bear one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ, which is love the Lord. You got with our heart. So I love your neighbors yourself. That's the law of Christ. You know, Jesus was the ultimate burden bearer. And so ask for help. When we say ask for help, we do mean ask God first, but that doesn't mean only ask God, right? Ask those people that God has put in your life who can hear well. So that doesn't mean just pick out someone from almost said the yellow pages like that exists anymore, right? Be strategic in that. Not all people that we ask are equal. Yeah, yeah. Don't scroll through your Facebook, you know, list of friends and hit them all up. Yeah. Um, the other thing that's going to be really helpful is just be emotionally honest with God about how you're doing. Um, and the Psalms are such a great place to find inspiration from this, right? David is just so authentic in God's presence that there are times where it almost appears schizophrenic, right? He's up, he's down, he's happy, he's sad, he's depressed, he's jubilant, right? He's honest. And if we're honest with ourselves, that's often our daily experiences. There's, there's exuberant highs and there's crushing lows and there's a lot of space in between. And the more that we can be honest with God about how we're doing some really cool things happen. Um, one, it gives our heart the space to breathe because too often what we're trying to do with it is like squish it down to something more pocket sized and manageable. And that's not how we were meant to live. Right. And we've talked about this before on this platform extensively, the, the centrality of the heart to God and how much he cares about that. And, and so the more that we can be honest with God about how we're doing in the midst, I think there's a few things that make me sad about believers and suffering. And one is, even though we know better, we treat all suffering like it's from the enemy and we start binding up and rebuking before we've ever asked God, is this you or is this the enemy? And the other thing is we minimize the suffering. I'm fine. No, you're not. I can see it on your face. You're not okay. And you don't glorify God by minimizing your suffering. It actually diminishes, and I gotta be careful how I say this. And if I say it wrong, I know you'll clean it up for me. But if part of suffering is, if part of the goal of suffering is to have an effect on the people around us, if we're going through incredible suffering and we make it seem like, you know, I chipped a nail, we've actually diminished the glory of God in our life in bringing us through the suffering, whether it's miraculous deliverance or just perseverance. And then we try to come back out on the other side and say, okay, now that we're through the suffering, let me tell you just how bad this was. And they're like, okay, something doesn't add up here. There's, there's an authenticity to our suffering that actually contributes to the glory of God. It's the whole, you know, in our weakness, his strength is made perfect, right? You're, you're allowed to appear weak. You're allowed to not have it all together. And you're allowed to have people see that because that actually brings glory to God. So you said some, just a moment ago that I kind of want to circle back for a second. And I think that some people say, okay, well, that sounds nice to be emotionally honest with God, but am I being disrespectful? Am I being those sorts of things? You know, so a couple of reminders. Number one, us telling God anything, isn't telling him something he doesn't know. Right. Right. So it's coming out of our mouth. Doesn't mean he doesn't already know our heart, but some people will go like, okay, well, I need to not let it come out of my mouth because that's even worse. Sure. Well, I would like to submit that every part of the Bible is inspired by God. That means what we believe is that the Holy Spirit inspired the human writer to write down what he wrote the vast majority of times in scripture. What that means is, is the Holy Spirit inspires the human author to write something to another human. The Psalms and a few other places in scripture are unique in this area that the Holy Spirit inspires a human author to write down exactly what they're feeling back to God. So other people, so when we look at Psalms and we see the emotional honesty that's happening there, we need to understand that, that God inspired David or Moses or ASAP or whoever the Psalmist was in that particular section of the Psalms to write that down back to him, which means that God is not afraid of it. Yeah. And actually God knows that us being honest has not a benefit for him, but has the benefit for us. And I don't know that there could be anything more honest than writing something down that people are now reading thousands of years later on. I mean, it was like, well, I said it out loud, but unless there's a recording that's going to go on somewhere forever, people aren't reading it, but we're reading David and the stuff that he went through and all of that. And it's there for a purpose. And so if you feel like, well, I can't because it's disrespectful, we're missing it. It's actually an invitation. It's an invitation to take out, because it's the first step of beginning to understanding. And I'd like to say it's one of the first steps of transformation, because if we're unwilling to be honest with ourselves, it's highly, highly unlikely that transformation can occur because of the fact that we'll be fighting against the stuff that God wants to do. And so, you know, the enemy will always overplay his hand. He's always going to say, no good will come from this. And one of the ways he can overplay his plan is say, oh, well, don't, don't be honest. And it's not going to change anything. It's not going to change anything. And maybe just, maybe it's not going to change the circumstances, but God is much more concerned in transforming us first than he are the circumstances, you know, joy and peace and hope isn't the removal of circumstances. Joy and peace and hope is having those fruits of spirit in spite of the circumstances. In fact, that is the way that we are able to then show the goodness of God because, you know, as I referred to last Sunday, you know, when Jesus was talking about, well, of course you can have, you can love those who love you. The tax collectors do that. You know, I'd like to extrapolate that principle out. Of course you can have joy and everything's going well. Even anybody can do that or hope when everything's going well, even when in peace, but no, what about something alien and stranger about having those fruits of spirit when all the circumstances say you shouldn't, that that's transformation of us internally, but that's also something other people want. That's showing the, some of the goodness of God in ways that maybe we don't normally show it. Yeah, absolutely. So ask God if you don't feel like you're hearing from God in that moment, or you're not really confident in your ability to hear from God at all. And you're in the middle of this suffering, reach out and ask people around you, right? We're made for that community and not just in moments of emergency, but in moments of emergency in particular, ask for that. Be honest with God about how you're feeling, right? And, and use the Psalms as a model. And in part, because when we verbalize those things, some of the stuff that comes out, if we verbalize it, we hear it ourselves and go, hang on, that's not actually right. And it, but if we don't let it come out, it sort of simmers here beneath the surface. And we never realize that we're operating from a place that if we heard ourselves say it, we'd go, no, I mean, this happened to me just a few months ago. Man, I was in the middle of just like, I was getting beaten up left and right. Like, God, you're not taking care of me. God, all this stuff is going wrong. God, I don't like any like, and it was just, I was getting pounded. Like I was sitting in a chair on a Saturday morning and all this stuff was just swirling. And, and I've cultivated enough of a relationship with God that in those moments, I know some things to do. And one of them was, all right, God, what are the things that I'm believing that aren't true? And the challenge was all the things that I was believing felt so true that I couldn't get out of the fog. It was just like, you know, this is never going to work out. I was like, crap, that, that feels true with it. That's probably not going to work out and you're not going to recover from this. Like, this is a downward trajectory and it's just going to, and I was like, man, it feels like that. God, like, what am I believing? That's, that's not true. And then, you know, to your point of the enemy is always going to overplay his hand. This thought comes to mind, no good will come from this. And as soon as I said those words out loud, it was like, hold up, I've gone way too far with God in my life to believe that that's possible. No good, right? I know the God I serve. It is not possible for no good to come out of this time of suffering. And it was just, it was one of those times where like suddenly the fog starts to lift. And I, and I was able to see the things that I was believing in a new way, the things that had felt so true when they were subterranean suddenly come out into the light. And I look at them and go, huh, that's not actually right. And from there I can now begin to engage with God, not only with a clearer mind, but with a heart that's not in nearly as much turmoil. You know, you mentioned, I think there's the words you just said, things felt like they were piling on. Was it that, which sort of illustrates something else. I think that, you know, you wrote down here when I read it, I was like, oh, that so resonates with me that sometimes one of the hardest things to do to embrace discipline or suffering is when you already feel like you've got enough. Like, haven't I had enough God? Yeah. I, you know, things are already difficult and you know, you input whatever's difficult for you. Cause that's really interesting there. I think there are a few things that are universal difficulty, universally difficult is a better way to say it, but I do meet some people that I'm like, how's that not difficult for you? How's that not difficult for you? That, that was hugely difficult for me. Maybe they look at something in my life. I don't know that, that I handle differently. They go, how is that not difficult for you? That just seems totally difficult. I know in our marriage, there's my wife, Kathy, who's just the greatest gift. This side of Jesus that I've ever been given has a whole set of things that are easy for her that are hugely difficult for me. I have a smaller set that are easy for me. That's difficult for her, but they're, you know, like, oh, so we do understand at some level, the difficulty is relative. So it's not a, let's compare my difficulty of things piling on with your difficulty. Your difficulty is your difficulty. Your suffering is your suffering. Yeah. Um, but I think, no, I know that I can very easily, and I, if you're listening to this, I believe you can follow this category as well. Come up with, all right, if suffering is inevitable, now I have a plan of how the suffering should play out. Sure. And by that, I mean, not just a plan about what the end result is, but even like the best possible, most effective time. Can we schedule this on Thursday of next week? Because I have more time, Jesus, to process it with you because I know it's inevitable. So we just make inconvenient, but that's not exactly how it works both because life doesn't work that way. But also because I think God has something greater that that's moving on. I know that, um, we have an encounter conference coming up. We've talked about it before. We don't use this platform to plug that, but we do believe in the same way is one of the most effective ways that you can learn deeper, what it looks like to ask God and be spiritually transformed. So depending upon when you're watching this, if you're watching this before Friday night, the 24th of, of November, September, February, don't even know what it is. Sorry. 24th of February and Saturday, the 20th of February in the year of our Lord, 2023, go to the website, sign up, right? Uh, if you miss that time, we're going to do more, go to the website, see if there's another one coming up. But that's a really, as the leader of that conference and, uh, you know, we know Jesus leads it, but you're as earthly representative here, there's a lot more on your shoulders. And so that's hard. It's difficult. And I've seen you on the Sundays, um, post encounter, you are moving, but it's hard. And then that's like good tired, but still suffering. And then God asked you to do something that you would never sign up for. Right? Oh, yeah. Yeah. So I was, you know, driving home from church the Sunday after our most recent encounter conference. And, and I was, I was burned out because I mean, it's not just the weekend of it's the two weeks leading up to it's all the prep. It's all the, all the, all of it, all of it. And then all the things that happen day of, as you're helping people walk through their pain, it's just, it's exhausting. It's awesome. It's my favorite thing to do, but it's exhausting. It's a Sunday. I do all the Sunday stuff I got to do. I'm in my truck, I'm heading home and I've got my plan for recovery and my plan for recovery involved all kinds of tasty, not healthy for me, food and a football game. And I felt God's prompting, Hey, you know what you're doing, right? You're, you're trying to control your suffering. And again, this is mild suffering relative to lots of other things. Objectively. What's going on? Our sufferings are suffering. Our sufferings are suffering. And so I'm, I'm burned out and I just, I want what I want and I want my suffering to end on my terms in my time. And I felt like God say, you know how you are with food. You know that you and food have had some spiritual issues before that you go to it for comfort instead of coming to me. And so how would you respond if I asked you to fast for the rest of the day? And I was not a happy camper with that, but it was very revealing in the moment that I was desperately trying to control my suffering, my way that I wanted my comforts when I wanted them, that, that I wanted to be God of my little universe instead of letting God be God. And it was so hard to do the hard thing in the midst of hard things. But I did it because I trust him not because I liked it, but because I trust him. And honestly, it was the best recovery from encounter I've ever had. And that's not to say that's not my prescription for all encounters. It may very well be. And I'll probably ask the question and I'll not like the answer perhaps. Practically though. I mean, you're yes and no with your prescription. Yeah. You're, you're not saying your prescription is not to eat anything. Your prescription is always ask God. Exactly. Yeah. But it was, it was another lesson learned for me around this topic of suffering is sometimes one of the best times to do a hard thing is in the midst of hard things because it actually accelerates your growth. It's the most efficient time to target. The thing that's in need of God's attention is to double down on the difficulty in a way that's not masochistic in a way that's not dysfunctional in a way that's not disordered in a way that's not now striving on my own to get the reward on my terms. Yes. But to trust God where he's leading and trust that sometimes God asks us to do a hard thing when it's hard rather than when it's easy. So if you've gotten this far in our last few minutes, what we just kind of want to do is give you some, some, again, the goal of this is to take it practical and we're going to just make sort of some quick statements. And if you're like, well, how to, here's the thing we invite you again, let us know. I think most of us will know kind of somehows, but maybe we bumped up against some more that we need to go deeper on. But the first is like cultivate this conversational relationship with God. If you want to navigate the next emergency or suffering differently, cultivate it before the next crisis. Here's what I mean by that. I talked on Sunday about if you lived in Buffalo, you're always prepared for the snow. Virginia is really erratic. I don't know how many people I know who go try to find a snow shovel once the snow is already been forecast for 36 inches or once it started. That is not the time to go buy a snow shovel or a snowblower or however you remove the snow. The time is to prepare before cultivate the readiness and see suffering is not something that we can expect to come. It's not a matter if it's when. And so there's something about having this conversational relationship with God in a unique places before it hits in case of emergency break glass. It's not that he won't talk to you. He will talk to you. It's not that he won't communicate. He will. It's just the level and the qualitative ability to hear when you're already in that relationship before the emergency. Just it grows. Not just a relationship with God, though, with others. Right. Because it's really hard to begin. Start talking about your suffering when you don't have anyone in your life that you've actually talked about other stuff with. It's not that it can't happen. Don't get me wrong. But then that can feel like maybe I'm projecting my own stuff. It's like I just start talking to John in the midst of my suffering. It could really seem and there's an appropriate place for having a counselor. But that's the the the only part of that relationship it would seem like. But if we have a relationship brought of that, then there's an aspect of it, but not the defining thing of it. Hopefully that makes some sense. But I think lots of times because of our fierce independence, we don't cultivate that. And then we wonder why when we really, really need it, it's not really there. It's kind of a little bit like the snow shovel in some ways. And this is I'm just going to do this to hand over to John, because one of John's favorite things to say is do hard things. Yeah, not because I like it though, but just I've discovered the necessity. And so again, it's the idea of do hard things by choice before they become a necessity. Right. And you know, I've got a friend that pushes his body physically to do hard things so that his body will be ready to do hard things. And I have done that somewhat, not nearly to the extent that I probably should, but spiritually it's much the same. I was talking to a guy a few months ago. He said, you know, I know, I know I should cultivate my relationship with God. I don't really hear from him the way that I want to. I get static all the time. It's really frustrating, but there's just so many other things in my life right now demanding my attention. And I feel like God and I were good enough that it's just been easy to push it to the back burner. Like I totally get it. No condemnation, no judgment, no criticism. And it's going to snow. Yeah. And you're going to need a shovel. And as we were talking before, you can do it with your garden shovel if that's all you got, but there's better tools. And so cultivate your toolbox when it's not crisis so that you have it when the crisis is there. And then the last one is this, and we touched on it last week a little bit with this notion of why was it that the early disciples, the apostles, the early church fathers, why was it that they could just so brazenly talk about embracing suffering and not with cool indifference, like, oh, whatever, bring it on. But I can endure the worst. And it was because they had a fundamentally different perspective of what was coming later. They just did. I mean, we used these phrases last time that for Peter and for Paul, they're able to, in the face of physical persecution, say, it's okay. You actually can't kill me because I already have eternal life. There's nothing you can do to my body that God can't restore, can't heal, can't resurrect in this life. Or if he so chooses to take me into eternity, then I live forever. There's nothing you can do to me that has any sort of lasting effect. And so I'm not afraid. And they say the same with their stuff, right? There's nothing you can't take from me. There's nothing you can take from me that God can't replace a hundredfold, which is the audacious promise that Jesus gives in the Gospels that anyone who suffers for my sake, anyone who gives up or loses family members, homes, resources, I'm going to replace that a hundredfold. And so what you can't touch, you can't touch anything that God can't restore. It's just a fundamentally different way of seeing reality, of seeing the kingdom, of seeing the life to come. And so I got this from one of my favorite authors, John Eldridge, in a book that he wrote called All Things New. And again, we don't promote stuff here per se, but sometimes you're like, I'm about to read something lengthy. And as a good school teacher, I cite my sources. So he talks about where's your hope? Where's your joy? You know, Hebrews 12 talks about, for the joy set before him, Jesus endures the cross. For the joy set before him, he endures the most horrific suffering mankind's ever experienced. For the joy set before him. And so it begs the question, where's your hope? Where is your hope placed? Where is your joy found? And he goes on to talk about this idea of casual hope, precious hope, and ultimate hope. And so I'm just going to read this excerpt because I think it helps to crystallize for us what might be a recovery of that perspective that Peter and Paul have of things eternal, things of the kingdom, things that can never be lost and never be stolen and never be broken and never be killed. And so he says this about hope. When our hopes are in their proper places, attached to the right things, not only do we flourish better as human beings, but we're rescued from a thousand heartbreaks. For not all hopes are created equal. There's casual hopes, precious hopes, and ultimate hopes. Casual hopes are the daily variety. I sure hope it doesn't rain this weekend. I hope we can get tickets to the game. I really hope this flight is on time. Nothing wrong with this brand of hope at all. It's human nature to have it. I think it's the sign of a healthy soul when we often use the words, I hope. He says, my wife does. I hope this pie turns out, meaning she cares about the dinner she's hosting. I hope we get to the Tetons next year, meaning she cares about dreams and family memories. Hope shows your heart is alive. But of course, those casual hopes are nothing when compared to our precious hopes. I hope this pregnancy goes well. I hope God hears my prayers for my dear friend. I hope the CT scan turns out to reveal nothing at all. Precious hopes are far deeper to our hearts and they tend to fuel our most earnest prayers. But deeper still lie our ultimate hopes, our life and death hopes. He says, I would suggest that the only things that belong in the category of ultimate hopes are the things that will destroy your heart and soul if they are not fulfilled. I hope God can forgive me. I hope somehow my mistakes can be redeemed. I hope I will see you again. You'll notice that many people have let their hopes go wandering. They've made casual hopes into precious hopes and turned genuinely precious hopes into critical or ultimate hopes. With all kindness, the person who gives up on life because their loved one chose another has taken a precious hope and made it the outcome of their very being. He says, I would say that when a casual hope is deferred, we're disappointed, but no more. We're downcast for a moment or a day. But when a precious hope is dashed, it can really break your heart. You may not recover for a week or maybe five years, depending on the level of loss and the other resources in your life. As Proverbs said, hope deferred makes the heart sick. Doesn't it though? But when an ultimate hope goes unanswered, the result is devastation from which you will never recover. And here's the point. The renewal of all things, a kingdom perspective, an eternal mentality is meant to be your first hope in the way that God is your first love. And if that isn't the answer to your wildest dreams, if you aren't ready at this very moment to sell everything and buy this field, then you've placed your hope somewhere else. And nearly everyone has. And so, friends, as we wrap this up, one of the most practical invitations that we can offer in this category of suffering is to examine where you have placed your hope, not intellectually, not theologically, but at a heart level. Have you placed your hope in yourself that you'll come through when no one else does, including God? Have you placed your hope in that vacation getaway because you've been burning the candle at both ends? And as long as I get that, I'll be okay. And then you get sick or the flight gets canceled and the vacation goes away. Now what? Right. You've placed that hope in that retirement nest egg and then the market crashes. Where is your ultimate hope? Not up here, but living out of here. That may be the most practical thing you can do as a result of this episode is to spend some time with God and examine the alignment, the ordering, the order of things, the ordering of your hopes and see what he shows you. Amen. So thank you for joining us for five consecutive weeks on suffering. We're going to be back next week for more on suffering and the week after that too. So we're just going to keep slogging through this topic and hopefully continue to bring some valuable nuggets along the way. Um, but as always reach out if you have questions, comments, or want to invite us further into your story. And if not, we look forward to seeing you all next time.
