Welcome back to the Faith Forward Podcast, John Ackerman, Brian Bales, both wearing plaid today because it's fall and that's the rule. It is. Now I'm still wearing sort of a spring-ish sort of plaid, really, really quickly though because it's getting up to 74 today. I did think about doing the oranges sort of plaid today, but I thought, and the more flannel like you have. But John, you have not reached this particular age yet. It's coming soon. I can't wait to see where this is going. It's coming soon. I'm not sure that I made this term up by me, but I don't know anyone else has used it, but I feel like very few things I come up with is original. So just for our viewers and listeners, I am full on in menopause, which means that I can sweat for no particular reason as I've reached in my fifties. And so when I wear flannel, it better be cold that day, or it could get really ugly really fast. Which by the way, let's just know that the new ad to our podcast is Smell-O-Vision. You'll appreciate that if you hit the upgraded version, when you go to YouTube. Clearly all just joking on my end, not about the menopause, the Smell-O-Vision part. Oh, this is our best opener yet. That's a funny transition because the theme of this series that we're in right now is for something greater. So I think there's all kinds of application here that we can get into. Here comes the marketing. But in all seriousness, we're in the second week of this series. We're walking through the book of Nehemiah, but thematically approaching this topic of for something greater. That so often we have a tendency, especially in the Western world, like we talked about last week of individualizing scripture to the point that we only look at the individual relationship of one person with God, of what God's doing in the life of one person and through that one person. And we so often miss that what God is most interested in is the community of believers, the capital C church, the entirety of his children working together for something greater. So you were talking in this Sunday's message, pause, make sure you watch the Sunday message, we'll be here when you get back, unpause, that you were talking about specifically as Nehemiah has gone from the grief that he feels when he discovers that the walls of Jerusalem still have not been rebuilt and the dishonor that that's bringing upon not only the people of God, but God himself. He's now beginning to put the plan that he's gotten from God into action. Yes. So would you walk us through a little bit of where you took us on Sunday? And then as always, we'll take this into the, all right, what do we do with this now? Yeah. So you mentioned this is a series about what God does to the people of God. But the first two chapters really are, is God using an individual that he's already strategically placed in, you know, Acts chapter 17, I didn't mention this, um, in the sermon, or at least I haven't yet mentioned it in the sermon, um, is very clear that God puts us in a place for a time and a purpose. And we see this, uh, especially during people who are Jewish people during the reign of the Medes and the Persians, we see Esther for such a time as this, we see Ezra in there, we see Zerubbabel in there, and now we see Nehemiah placed in points and places of influence in the government. So God is now going to be working with Nehemiah to bring him as a catalyst because what we see in this section of scripture is, is that as Nehemiah steps in, in chapter two, what God does is something that is immeasurably more than we could ask or imagine. You've listened at all in person or online to Sunday services. If I close, it is very common that I use the benediction from Ephesians chapter three. Now unto him being God who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, depending on what version that you might quote it from, I'm quoting it from the NIV. Some people say exceedingly more. You know, it says unto him who's able to do immeasurably more according to his power that's worked within us. But I think one of the tensions that happens that I was trying to bring out this particular week is that many of us have a theory of an immeasurable God without experiencing the reality of an immeasurable God. Because the only way to experience the fact that he is an immeasurable God is to step out beyond our comfort zone, to step out into this place of risk, to step out in many ways to where all we know is that the voice of God has asked us to do it. And we know the character of God says he'll never leave us or forsake us. But it doesn't mean that there isn't some pain points that could happen, some difficulty. And so one of the things that as we stepped in to this idea, when we pick up chapter two, which as I mentioned on Sunday, the gap between the end of chapter one and the beginning of chapter two is about four months. Most of us don't know our Hebrew months. I don't remember them very well, but there's four months gap. It lets us know right there in the text that now what is clear is that God is asking Nehemiah to use his position with King Artaxerxes to be able to go back and to engage the community of believers known as the Jewish people into something greater, to rebuild the walls. But as Nehemiah walks through this, there's some things that we read from him. And one really is, is that when we get to verse three or the end of verse two, it says that Nehemiah was very much afraid. Why? Well, as I explained, there's a lot of cultural things we don't grasp, but the best way to put it is if this doesn't go well, there's a whole lot of pain coming his way. By the way, it did go well, but still some pain comes later. And so we have to actually confront this lie that the enemy gives in us, or that culture tells us is that number one, that all pain is bad, and that number two, that following God will not result in pain. I said this on Sunday, we may have time to get into it. The belief that following God does not result in pain is a functional denial of the gospel. Because Jesus, in Isaiah chapter 53, it says the punishment that he took brought us peace. That pain often can be used for something greater. The greatest example is Jesus' pain, his sacrifice on the cross, was happened so something greater could occur, and that is our peace with God. And so we walk through this, but if we're going to step into that, the two things I ended with, and there was a lot of things I could talk about, but I think these are the two most important ones that I drew from this passage in Ephesians, Nehemiah chapter 2, was one is that something greater is always going to require a greater prayer life than we probably have right now. Like I might have a great prayer life, awesome, it's probably going to need to be greater when God asks you to step out. And secondly, something greater requires greater risk. And one of the things I said about risk is it is irrelevant what other people feel about your risk tolerance or your risk avoidance. There's some people that see me and think I'm a huge risk taker. Some of the people who see me and say, this guy can't take a risk for anything. And I've actually had people say that on both ends about the same thing, you know, from church. That's not actually relevant. What's most relevant is what is Jesus asking you to do? That is the question. You know, clearly for Nehemiah, he was positioned and asked him to step out and to provide. And God does. And we went in that. I mean, so much that he gets a position that he wants. He's appointed governor over this whole area. And this blows me away, the king finances the whole deal. Don't miss that. It's one thing to say, you can go do this, but now you've got to figure out how to pay for it. The king, talk about immeasurably more than you can ask or imagine. And so that's some of the backgrounds about Sunday. But we're going to dig in a lot too about this idea, especially starting with something greater requires a greater prayer life. Because I know, John, you have lots of passions. But at the top of the list, I'm sure, is what does it look like to live relationally with God? Because that's prayer. Prayer is a conversation with God. Let's demystify that. If you're hearing this and thinking that means we always go into the corner, which is nothing wrong with that. And we bow our heads and close our eyes. And that's how we're communicating. But it's this relational conversation with God. Yeah. And I was really glad you pointed out, assuming, again, we record this early. So I'm assuming you said this line, and I hope you did, because it's a great line, that when we limit our communication with God to the moments of danger or uncertainty, as in those are the only times that we talk to God and expect him to respond. We're limiting the power of God in our lives. We only hear and understand God to the level we have a relationship with God. And so exactly to that point you were just making, that if we look at the story of Nehemiah and we only look at it as Nehemiah really didn't talk with God much other than the times where he found out that the walls of Jerusalem were down and he was grieved by it. And he's like, God, we got to do something. I need to do something. Tell me what to do so I can go do it. And then he does have his moment finally with the king and has this moment of sheer panic when the king looks at him and realizes that he's sad and he's like, I might kill you for this because it's disrespectful to me. God, what do I say? Tell me right now. I need an answer. Right? If those are the only moments where we interact with God, we are missing, we're missing so, so much of a relationship with God day by day, moment by moment. And one of the things that it shows us is that we are primarily looking at God as the person that tells us what to do and where to go. And we've talked for a couple of years now about a transactional relationship with God. And usually by that we mean, I'm usually going to God to get something and then I'm going back and doing my thing and then I'm going to God to get something, then I'm going back to doing my thing. But if we're not careful, we can just flip the motives on that transactional relationship and believe that God just wants a transactional relationship with us. I just want you to go do something and now I'm going to be quiet for a while. Okay, now I need you to go do something else and then I'm going to be quiet for a while. And that's not God's nature. That's not God's character. That's not God's interest in us. And so something greater requires a greater prayer life. Even that can feel like it's God being transactional with us. That if you want more, you better do more. You better earn it. And for some of us, that just so deeply resonates. And for some of us, we like that it resonates because it's transactional and we know what to expect as far as the outcomes. I have this sort of sports analogy in my head. Once you've put in enough practice hours, then you get to be on the first team. You have to earn it in that way. And that can be a very, I don't know what the word I'm looking for is, but easy way to believe a lie about God. But he wants to, and it blew me away actually this moment where I realized he spent more time with God, interacting with God about what are you supposed to do, four months. And spoiler alert, if you know Nehemiah, they rebuild the walls. It only took them 52 days to rebuild the walls. So let's just say it's 122 days of spending time with God versus 52. And he spent time with God in those 52 as well. But I think there's something about his relationship with God was preparation for this moment. It's not that God wouldn't have answered him. I heard actually Rochelle Walker on staff, she mentioned the other day that prayer where he shoots a prayer up to God as sort of an arrow prayer, like he's shooting an arrow up to God. And I love that analogy. It's not that God won't necessarily answer that, he will, right? The point is, is that there's a relational connection that makes that so much easier. And I would like to say, while I can't prove it from this particular text, I think I can prove it from the whole of scripture, that that's probably what helped him in that moment as well because of that relationship, even though by the way, he was very afraid. But here's what I love, and I don't get into this on Sunday, there is absolutely nothing wrong with fear. If you've listened to this podcast, I've said this before, fear is an emotion created by God. If you stand in front of a lion and you say, I don't have a spirit of fear. You're right. You have a spirit of stupidity, right? You do. You have a spirit of stupidity. God has given us a fear as an emotion. Scripture says, do not be controlled by the spirit of fear. What that means is, is that when rightful or wrong fear comes into our life, the point of what we're supposed to do with it is not take it ourselves and try to solve it. Do exactly what Nehemiah is. Take that fear to God. I mean, he's overcome with fear and he goes directly to the one, he has a relationship who's able to do immeasurably more than we all could ask or imagine, which allowed him, I believe, the wisdom in that point of to engage that. Because the text also doesn't say when he knew he was supposed to go and lead, but somewhere between the burden at the end of chapter one and the ask at the beginning in chapter two, he knew. And the next question is, well, when and how? Because it was a lot of danger about doing right protocol and doing those sort of things. And so it is something like we only hear and understand God to the level of relationship we have with him. And it doesn't mean that we don't hear him if our relationship is shallow. John chapter six says that even we don't have a relationship with God, the first time we hear him is when he draws us, right? You know, I draw you. What it does mean is I was trying to illustrate on Sunday, I'm just better with people. I used an example of Kathy and I taking walks. We do that one because it's good to exercise, but two, it's uninterrupted time. Sometimes people in our neighborhood see us argue. Sometimes people in our neighborhood see us just talking about our days. But as I build that relationship, when those other things happen, it's just stronger. It's just better. It doesn't mean I couldn't get an answer. So that's what I mean by that. I think all of us can say we only hear and understand our spouse or our friend or our kids or whoever God's put in our life at the level that we have relationship with them. That's clear. But then you started asking some questions that you were poking at me personally, just so you know, through these questions. Yeah, we take turns doing that. Last week I felt targeted by his message. So this week it's fair to turn it around. As we so often do, what we try to do here on the Faith Forward podcast is in most cases just pose questions. Because Brian, as you've so often said, neither one of us makes a very good God for other people's lives. The best source of life and truth for your life is the source of life and truth. And so what we've come to realize is it's most helpful to just come up with questions and then take those questions to God and let him do the teaching, let him do the modeling, let him do the illustrating. And so the questions that came up around this idea of cultivating a greater relational life with God, cultivating a greater prayer life, meaning a greater relational life with God, not just I pray harder or louder or I use more scripture or I wake up exceedingly early because that's super spiritual, right? It's cultivating a greater relationship with God. And so the questions are this, what parts of your life are withheld from God? And by that I mean this, some version of, don't worry God, I've got this. You had mentioned at the beginning how you close most services with the benediction from Ephesians 3. And it just struck me that for most of us, we work really hard to not need an immeasurable God. Yeah. And I think there's, as I was processing this question, I wrote a note down. I don't know how other people receive the question. So just this is me being open about sometimes why I withhold parts of my life from God. It's because I feel like not that God can't handle them, that that actually isn't it more than that. It's that I'm being lazy if I give them to God, it's my responsibility. It's a lie that I believe that I think I could give you reasons that I believe it. And I think we've all been around other earthly relationships where people are passing off onto you things that they should be doing themselves, or they don't necessarily do it to at least according to my very high standards, I think they should look into it. And sometimes that can be really frustrating for me. And so I know that as I'm wired, I try not to do that to other people. I'm sure I do many other things that frustrate them or bother them. I just asked someone yesterday in a conversation, it was clear that I was frustrating them. And I was like, how am I frustrating you? Because I didn't understand, but it was clearly happening. And but I think I then take that and what I think I'm trying not to do to other people, I do that to God. Yeah. And so like if I bring this to God, this part of my life, it feels irresponsible or I've shared this before. There's probably we talk about blessings and curses a lot. And when we talk about curse, we're not talking some Harry Potter sort of thing, even though I guess that could be part of a conversation around legitimate cursing. But more often than not, we're talking about words you speak onto someone that aren't blessings. You probably could find no better way to hurt me than to call me lazy. I mean, that's a, it's a big thing inside of me that Jesus is working on that. I do it to myself. Like when I don't, like if I bring this to God, I'm just being lazy. I'm being irresponsible. I'm passing off onto God something. And so even when you think about this question and taking your faith forward, some of us may think I'm withholding this part of my life from God because he won't love me. Or he went in that very much be true. How what you think not true about God, but true what you think. But for some of us out there that are probably more performance driven than we should be more that I do believe there's a possibility that we don't bring things to God simply because we feel like it's our responsibility. And if we do, we're not being the type of person God has made us to be, which is a lie that we believe. Yeah. Yeah. And so that, that runs nicely into just another way of getting at some of this, because sometimes again, it's not that you have to get the question right for God to talk to you, but sometimes words matter and different words unlock different parts of our heart or help us to see ourselves in new ways. And so, you know, that question of what parts of your life are withheld from God, you could take it in a couple of different ways. So asking a similar kind of question in a different way, which things feel too small to bother him with? You know, there was, I know I've told this story several times, but God and I had a conversation one time over whether or not I should grow a beard because I spent 15 minutes debating the pros and cons of, should I, or should I not? Because it was related to something I was doing at the high school I was teaching at. And it was for a, you know, a, a fundraising thing that was going to help out the kids. And it just strikes me though, there are people who watch this podcast who've never seen you without a beard. You might need to bring back the old Potomac Falls teacher ID that I'm aware is out there of the different looking clean shaven John Ackerman. There's a few. There's a few. Yeah. There's a few. But it was funny because my wife stopped me in the moment after recognizing that I was really getting wrapped around the axle on this. And she said, have you asked God about it? And my first thought was, that's a dumb question. Why would I bother God with whether or not, and not like I'm taking up God's time because it's preventing him from getting to other things, but like a, what would God possibly have to say to me about growing a beard other than maybe like yes or no, or, you know, stop bothering me. And if you've heard the story, it doesn't change the significance of it for me. So you just get to listen to it again that I did finally pause and I was like, all right. And it was super half-hearted God, whatever. Is there anything you want to say to me about a beard? Probably not. Cause that's dumb. And his response back to me was a question, which is classic Jesus, right? Answering a question with a question. It was, why do you have such a hard time choosing yourself? And it was amazing that I learned something about God in that moment, as well as learning something about myself. What I learned about him was that there is absolutely nothing that's too small or insignificant. There is nothing that he's not interested in talking about with us. And again, if our view is God, tell me what to do and where to go. We can oversimplify this to, I'm laying in bed. God, should I get up? I'm not moving until you say yes or no, God, should I put on underwear today? I'm not doing anything until you say yes or no. That's not what I'm talking about, but there are things that we believe are up to us that are our responsibility. We believe that there are things that are seemingly small or insignificant or of no value to God that are of great value to us. And we're missing out if we don't invite him into those places, because what he'll so often do is show us more of who he is in that moment and show us more about us. It wasn't about the beard, obviously it stuck around for a while, but it was more about how I see myself. I have a hard time choosing myself. In that 15 minutes of going back and forth and back and forth, I wasn't at all considering what I wanted. I was considering what everybody else wanted, which is the story of my life. And he brought that to my attention through whether or not to grow a beard. And so sit with questions like this, are there parts of your life you're withholding from God because you feel like you've got it? Are there parts of your life that feel too small to bother him with that you feel like he expects you to handle this on your own, some version of that responsibility? Or are there things that feel too big for you to bother God with? And what's really interesting about that is we would never say this with our mind, right? We would never say there's anything too big for God because we know the classroom answer to that, that there is nothing too big, that God is the biggest thing. He's the strongest thing. He's the most powerful thing. But there are places in our heart that will absolutely hold onto the belief that God couldn't do something about this. So this is my experience and know what I said, this is my experience. Now personally, it's my experience and it's my experience as I have the privilege of talking to lots of people that for most of the people that I engage in myself as well, believing that something is too big for God to physically deal with isn't the challenge as much as the emotion that I have. You're too big to make me feel at peace even though I don't have blank. This is too big for you. I don't know how I'm going to have peace without this. I mean, you can part the waters to the Red Sea. I'm not doubting your physical power, but there's something inside of us, the pain, the hurt, whatever it might be, to where we think that's too big for God. We don't say it that way, but because we don't bring it to him, that's the implication, right? I've got to deal with that. I know for me, a lot behind this particular talk is this idea of pain, our desire to avoid it. And so there are some things I think, certainly as I've met with other people in my own life, that if you, can God do this? Sure he can. Absolutely. I'm not doubting your physical abilities, but internally I'm like, I don't know how God's ever going to change my heart on this. I don't know how he's ever going to make me feel safe here. I don't know how he's ever going to do it. And he can do immeasurably more. And that's just not something that says I can part a Red Sea or I can create the world, you know, just by voice. He's talking about changing those inner parts. And I think for lots of us, that's really where the struggle is. And that's the difference between, again, having the theory of an immeasurable God, and not experiencing the reality of an immeasurable God, because most of us don't need the Red Sea to part. That's not what we need. What we need is him healing that part inside of us that we may or may not know needs to be healed. And sometimes he does the Red Sea, but for greater purposes. Like you just mentioned, the beard wasn't about the beard. It was to heal something else he wanted to talk to you about. And so I think there's a good chance that for lots of us, the things that feel too big aren't the physical stuff. Even though let me just say there are some like I've met people who have significant financial challenges due to divorce or due to death or due to all kinds of things outside of their control. But most of the time, that's my experience. So yeah, so what else we're going to talk about? So if something greater requires a greater prayer life, limiting the topics is one of the things that will keep us from this. Limiting the time is something else. And there's a couple ways that we could look at this. And again, it's not about obligation. It's not about behavior. It's not about God being transactional or us needing to be transactional, but I was stuck with this. And so I'll throw out the quote and then sort of throw it back to you to process however you want to. But Dallas Willard, if you're familiar with him, he says smart things on a regular basis. And somebody had asked him, you know, basically, how do I develop the relationship with God that you seem to have with God? And what their question really was when they were willing to be specific was, okay, so you must have like time with God in the morning, right? Your quiet time, your time alone. What does that 15, 20 minutes look like? Because whatever you're doing, I'll start doing it because then I'll get your prayer life. I'll get your relational life with God. And Dallas Willard pauses for a little bit and he gives us some genuine thought. And his response is, I think God rather cares more about the other 23 hours and 45 minutes of your day. And so there's something about the box that we've put our relationship with God into, the time that we've allocated out of our life. And we've said, God, you get to occupy this. And so it's similar to the limiting the topics, God, I've got this part of my life. Can you handle this? God, you get to this part of my day, I get this, that if we want something greater, we're going to have to not only invite them into more topics, but invite them into more time, but not in a transactional way. So I love what you're saying there, but not in a transactional way, how we're inviting him into this without even realizing it. I think in our lives, sometimes we can begin to not just check boxes, but to create paradigms where this is the way it has to work. You mentioned in that question that someone was posing, you know, the, I don't know if that was actually an implication or how they asked the question. The first thing in the morning, 15, I remember growing up and people go, well, God gets the first parts, the first fruits, they were completely and utterly taking that verse out of context. So he should get the first part of your day. So that can happen in my life. But the truth is, if that occurs, I'm giving him most likely the least product, the least good part of my day. This is true. I love no one more than I love my wife. Today actually is the anniversary, the 24th year we've been together. She said yes to date me 24 years ago today, 1999. So do the math, 24 years. And I love that woman, but we do not have significant conversation in the morning. It doesn't go well, it just doesn't. We're both not at our best. There's a whole lot of that sort of stuff. And so if I demanded that, well, first fruits and she's valuable, you get this, it's not going to go well, right? So first off, that's an example like, oh, they have the best time with God, dot, dot, dot. It needs to be this way. I think another sort of paradigm we've accidentally created is what that time has to look like, which I think that's what Willard was getting at when he said, I think he cares more about that other 23 hours and 45 minutes. So continuing with this relationship I have with my wife, we need to do more of this. Date night, date night is important. Date night is uninterrupted, eye to eyeball time, not talking about our jobs, not talking about our kids, which, you know, it's much harder than I thought it would be. You know, let's just talk about us. Okay, getting that as we've gotten older and gotten busier is a much more intentional thing. It just doesn't happen accidentally anymore. We've got to be doing that. But if the only time that I think we're developing a relationship is in date night, then it's going to miss something. I think what happens is, is when we think about prayer, and I think I've used this analogy before here, I know I've used it somewhere before if it's not here. If we begin to define growing our relationship with God, you know, and having a greater prayer life only through that, okay, this is when I get my 20 minutes. This is when I get my 30 minutes, which is in this analogy, date night, which is important. That's it. I mean, I've got to be interacting with my wife right now. I mean, there's a good chance she sent me a text while we're recording this. Who knows? I mean, all of these things happen. All of us know that. And so getting out of that, because what happens then without even trying is we accidentally create paradigms of what a good relationship or prayer life, but then we begin to compartmentalize him. Like, all right, you're in this part of my day, but I don't really invite you. I go through the other 23 hours of my day, even if you spend an hour in your prayer time, whenever you do it. I go through the other 23 hours of my day, and I only talk to him about it when I get to my hour the next day. And none of us would say in a significantly healthy relationship that that pattern of behavior repeated over and over again is going to yield the results or the relationships that we want to have. Because, you know, one of the things that we're trying to say is that we only hear and understand God to the level we have the relationship with God. We've got to grow that. And so what it does mean is it doesn't mean you've got to do this just to make God happy. Because that's what I believe. If I didn't get up first thing in the morning when this first, like somehow I'm not making God happy. And then when I was not doing it, well, look, all right, look, John said this last week, we've started recording this earlier in the morning. Last week, I brought water to a job that coffee was needed for. Okay. Recording this early in the morning. So I brought coffee this time. It's just going to make it harder. It's going to make it harder. And don't get me wrong. I like some mornings just quiet with Jesus, but I will really tell you that quiet is more like quiet presence sitting. Not necessarily we're having this great interactive time. He does talk and I do talk to him, but I, you know, it just looks different. So it doesn't let's do this to make God happy. We're going to compartmentalize. It doesn't mean just try harder because it didn't work in my, I got up at five o'clock. It didn't work. I'll get about four 45 or whatever it might be. It does mean though, you bring this point up that growing this relationship means building sustainable habits that usually work with slow change over time. So on Sunday, I talked about Kathy and I taking walks. That is a sustainable habit we can do where, and we also get our quality time together. It's not the same as going out to a nice restaurant. Don't get me wrong, but it is a version of date time. That's a sustainable habit for us that we can do because we can say to the kids, we're going on a walk and be back 45 minutes or an hour and 15 or an hour and a half later versus, all right, we're going out to dinner, which is great. I love going out to dinner. That's a much bigger thing. And so start with those sustainable things to grow and to build that relationship. And then when you have the extra opportunities, you'll see the slow stage over time, slow change over time. I now, we now know, and it's not uncommon, well, Hey, we'll talk about this when we take a walk later. Like remind me that sort of thing, you know, and that's that interaction. Yeah. And I think every single one of us knows this, that there are things in our life that we would like to see be different. And unless you make it a priority, unless you set aside time and resources for it, you find yourself a month later, six months later, a year later with that part of your life, fundamentally unchanged and wondering where the time went. And I'm reminded of this basic truth that it takes different effort to build a habit than it does to maintain it. It takes different effort. Often that different effort is more, but it takes different effort to build a habit than it does to maintain it. I am a morning person. I more or less wake up and it's not like I pop off, you know, the, and the sun is shining and the birds are singing and all as well, but I'm awake and, and the, the invitation to all this as always is ask God, right? That was part about the, you, this isn't about you needing to go figure out what to do to make God happy. This isn't about you needing to try harder. This isn't about you being transactional or God being transactional. This is, if you want a deeper relationship with God, first of all, so does God, God wants a deeper relationship with you and he's got some pretty good ideas of how to do it. And so I found myself at one time in my life, pretty early on in this relational connection to God going, God, I'm looking at my calendar. There's just no time. I'm teaching high school. I'm waking up at five 30 in the morning. I have to be out the door. I'm sometimes still grading papers in the morning while I drink my tea, like I'm coming home late. There's stuff I want to do. I want to still have some life. Like God, I'm not seeing it. Help me help me to see it differently. Tell me what to do. Not so that I can be obedient and check a box, but because I want a relationship. I want a deeper relationship with you. I want something greater, but I'm not seeing what to do. And again, you can hear this two different ways. His response to me was wake up at four 30. And you could hear that as transactional. You could hear that as I'm making you do something, you know, give me the first part of your day because that's the law. No, he knows I'm a morning person. It's a sacrifice, but it's not an impossibility. And it was also an invitation to choose to make something a priority. It wasn't a, well, you know, we'll, we'll, we'll find five minutes here and there because he knew my heart and my heart was, I want more. I want something greater and I'm willing to sacrifice. I just don't know where to make the sacrifice. He said, well, here, I'll help you. Are you busy at four 30? No, this sucks, but I wasn't super happy about it, but I recognize that there was something greater being offered. And so I did it. I did it for the better part of a year. Not always well, and not always happily, but I followed his leading and I was willing to trust him with the process of developing this relationship, not me figuring out how to develop this relationship. And he didn't tell me at first, wake up at four 30 for a year, he said, just try waking up at four 30 tomorrow. And so again, he is often about an invitation into slow change, change that can be maintained, not pick out three devotionals and four prayer books and 12 people to pray for. Start slow, but make it relational. So something greater requires a greater prayer life, not because you're trying to earn something and because you're trying to get God to give you something, or because God's making you jump through hoops before he'll do what you've asked. Something greater requires a greater relational connection to God, but something greater also requires a greater risk, which is the second thing you talked about on Sunday. And I think there's lots of things that can get in the way, um, pride, um, you know, we can have a higher view of ourselves. Um, and this is actually, uh, for me, the part of pride that I tend to struggle with more now that I can't have a higher view of myself than I should is a lower view of myself. And by the way, that is pride. It is, uh, that is pride. It's, it's hard to really get your head around it at first, like, how's that pride, you know, but it is, there are those things that can do that. But you know, one of the ones that I like to just kind of focus on for a couple of seconds is that point going back to fear, um, and fear specifically related to pain. I think a lot of time, our fear is based off what are the consequences that are net that can negatively happen because of this and negative consequences. We almost always say it's pain and we do, we live in a culture that is pain avoidant. Um, and, uh, even for people who are really into the gym, you know, I don't know anyone who says, Hey, if I could have all the, all the benefits without the pain of waking up the next day, you know, um, man, there you go. That's that's so, and so fear is one of the things I think it gets behind, um, this sort of risk. And I think one of the things we talk about is, um, one of the things we have fear is a view about ourselves, about the world or view about God. So, you know, some of us may have fear, like if we step out in risk and it doesn't go the way people think it should, that then they're going to look at us, take it away. I like to think that I wasn't a great people pleaser, um, until, um, the pandemic, the truth was, uh, or that it wasn't people, the truth was pre pandemic. I was a whole lot better at pleasing people and didn't realize how bad of a people pleaser I was. Right. Then all of a sudden, you know, I realized, okay, stepping into what I felt like God wanted me to do and that sort of stuff. And then it didn't necessarily pan a particular way. I have a few critics to say the least. Right. And, um, and Oh, then I realized next time I step into something like, Oh, this is a risk. What, what are they going to say? Right. What are they going to say? Or like, it's God going to be disappointed in me if I don't execute this well. That's another view about God. Or the third part, a lot of my fear comes from this belief is I get my value from what the results are. Yeah. Right. How do I perform? We did this. Yes. And we've talked about this in this podcast over and over again. Success is not what happens. Success is, did we obey or not? Yeah. Right. And we leave the results to God. Yeah. Um, but that's very hard for us because we are short term microwave people. Um, but God doesn't work on that time horizon. We have to come to this, this, that there are some things that God may ask us to step out and risk that this side of eternity, we will never see. We will never see what God's doing with them. That doesn't make us a failure. That doesn't make it not worth the risk because again, he'll never leave us forsake us. He won't invite us into anything. So risk can trigger that pride. It can, it can trigger all that fear, but risk, right? This is kind of the premise that I was saying reveals something when you step into it, that information itself can't because risk in a theory is a theory of an immeasurable God. Stepping into risk gives that opportunity for God to prove experientially what we say we know. And I mentioned some 46 first 10 on Sunday, uh, be still and know that I'm God. If you haven't heard me say this or John say this bears repeating anytime the word no, especially in Hebrew is used in Psalm 46, 10 is in Hebrew. It is not separating intellectual knowledge from practical experience. It's not. You could understand it our way of saying, be still and experience the reality that I'm an immeasurable God that you can experience just by saying I've got in my head. And sometimes that just requires us. And sometimes the risk isn't, is waiting, but you got to know that from sometimes a risk is stepping out. So it doesn't mean be still and don't do anything. It means rest in what I'm asking you to do. Stop being so restless. Stop trying to do that. I mean, think about what Nehemiah had to do in this moment. There's a lot of things that he said, Oh, if I'm going to be still, I don't do anything that, no, no, no, no. Don't have anxiety in the way that we might have it. Don't have that restlessness rest in me and then experience the reality. This is who I am. And I've, I honestly believe the only reason that he could take this greater risk was because of that greater relationship. And that's why I put them in the order that I put them in four months, four months, uh, of prayer time to do that. And so, but it's going to trigger that. And I love this. I love that. I want to expand on this. Sometimes choosing to do something hard is often as more difficult or as difficult than actually doing the thing itself. Yeah. I said earlier, most of us work really, really hard to not need an immeasurable God. And so the, the prospect of risk in most cases triggers both the fear in us of things are going to go horribly and I'm going to get hurt in 12 different ways. But in most cases it's because we've worked really hard to not need a big God in our day to day. And so oftentimes the difficult thing, the risk that God is inviting us into is the risk of letting him be who he is, not who we want him to be, which in most cases is the God who gives us stuff and then lets us do what we want. And so the choice to do something hard usually involves some version of the choice to let God be who he is, which is an immeasurable God, which is a God who can part seas, which is a God who can get foreign Kings to give you the resources to restore the walls of Jerusalem, right? You can't do that on your own. And that's why God's invitation is never go figure it out for yourself and report back to me. He says, do this with me. And oh, by the way, let me show you how big I am. Let me let you experience how big I am. And John, when you do that, right, I mean, isn't the result of what we're trying to talk about, then not only do we learn stuff about God, but that is the process where we begin to become transformed where, you know, I know that in daily life with my children or with other people that as I experienced this reality, the next time, it's not like a risk. There's other risks that are there, but I have deeper relationship, deeper understanding. And that's one of the points. It transforms our understanding of ourself and it transformed our understanding of God. I know that, um, Job, we had a little conversation about this off podcast about how, um, Job chronologically is actually the first book in the old Testament. A lot of people don't know this, uh, and Job never had Job to look back to, right? Job, there was no written scripture, uh, at that point for Job, Job to refer to. So, cause a lot of us, when we have pain and difficulty, we go, Oh, look at Job, be encouraged. He didn't have that. He was Job. And, um, it's one thing to go through what he went through, uh, and to have scripture or that sort of encouraged from another, uh, he didn't have any of that. So it's, it's amazing. Even in some things that God at the end draw to this tension, Hey, you've got to do this. But there's something, um, that Job says, I think that really draws us in chapter 42, right? Yeah. Yeah. Like you said, so much of what Job has is almost purely unadulterated relationship with God. He's got nothing else. And yet there's still things that he thinks he knows about God that he hasn't yet experienced. And, and there is this problem of pain throughout the book of Job that Job goes through an excruciating amount of pain across a dozen different areas. But at the end, he has to confront some of these same things that we have to his pride and his fear, his pride that he thought he knew. I thought I knew who God was and what God would do and wouldn't do. And I thought I knew who I was to God and how good I was. I thought I knew how good I was. And Job has this conversation with God and some people take God's responses to Job as sort of like a smack down, right? Sort of get back in your seat, sit down. Who do you think you are? Where were you when I, you know, those lines, but I don't read it that way. I read it as a correction, but, but not a condemnation. And it leads Job then in the last chapter of Job to respond to God with this. God, I know that you can do anything and no one can stop you. And you asked me, who is this that questions my wisdom with such ignorance? And Job responds, it's I. And I was talking about things I knew nothing about. Things far too wonderful for me. Lord, you said, listen, and I will speak. I have some questions for you. You must answer them. And Job says this, I had only heard about you before. I only knew you intellectually before, but now I've seen you with my own eyes. I take back everything I said, right? Job goes through the pain and discovers a depth of relationship and connection with God that he had only, in most cases, intellectually assented to before. And he's now come to a place of discovering the reality of who God is. And that's God's invitation for all of us. And it's interesting that Job, chronologically being the first book, is a book where pain doesn't get an answer, but it gets a promise. And I think we don't have time, and maybe some point we'll get into this, but I think lots of times we're willing to step out and risk if we can experience or see the something greater that God's doing. And I think when we put the book of Job in context, because Job never gets an answer, there is a biblical scriptural argument to be this. God allowed the pain in Job's life for something greater, and it wasn't the greater for him, it was the greater for us. Would we be willing to take that risk to step out and that sort of stuff if we knew that we might not, this side of eternity, ever experience it, but God's going to do something greater in the lives? In Job's case, maybe billions of people who have engaged with the text of Job over the some 4,000 years of written biblical history, wherein they can go, oh, I take encouragement from this, that God still loves me, he's still there, because Job shows it. But again, we get a peek into what God was doing that Job never does. And I think there's a chance that we may never get the peek sometimes. Are we okay with that if we still know the character of God, if we're able to say, Job chapter 42, verse 5? But again, that's probably a whole other podcast for a different time. But I think the last thing quickly is, though, is that when we risk, it also encourages and paves the way to others as we watch this happen. You mentioned Roger Bannister, first person to break the four-minute mile. It took a very, very long time for that to happen. And thanks for doing the research, by the way. Forty-six days later, it's broken. And now at least 1,755 times has been broken since 2022. In some cases by high schoolers. Yes, by high schoolers, right? We were talking off podcast again. Just recently, someone set the marathon record. I think it was right at two hours, not two hours and one minute. I think it was two hours and 35 seconds. That means that we're on the precipice of inside of the next X amount of years of someone running a marathon in under two hours, which means averaging more than 13 miles an hour for two straight hours. That's insane, just running 13 miles an hour. But I guarantee, based upon this principle, as soon as that one person breaks it, someone else is going to do it. And someone else is going to do it. And we can't miss the power that we have in other people's lives. And we step out in faith with God. We experience that immeasurable God that they then see, like in reality, like John experiences. And he's a real human being, not like someone in the Bible, who, by the way, are real human beings too. But sometimes when in the Bible, we make excuses, well, they got a book written about them. So Nehemiah doesn't count. Right. So often, that's the barrier. The barrier isn't physical ability. It's not even resources. It's belief. Yep. For so long, that four-minute mile barrier remained unbroken because nobody believed it was possible. The sound barrier remained unbroken because nobody believed it was possible. And that belief created a literal wall, in some cases, of we're just never going to be able to go past this. And you see that apply to your life with God. There are places that feel like we could never get past this, right? Israelites in slavery in Egypt for 400-some-odd years until someone, Moses, has a personal encounter with God in a way that fundamentally changes his understanding of what's possible. Doesn't mean he doesn't have fear. Doesn't mean he doesn't have fear of pain and abandonment and rejection and death and all these other things. But he has an experience with God that fundamentally shifts his understanding of what's possible. And you see the effect that that has not only in his life, but on the lives of millions of people in the nation of Israel. And so that's the reminder for us, as well, is something greater requires a greater risk. And if we're willing to step into it, it will have a generational impact. And sometimes that's enough to help us push through that place of unbelief, to continue to stick it out with God. God, show me more of who you are and who I am. Not that I have to do this on my own, but that you're going to do this with me. And in some cases, you're probably going to do this for me so that I can see just how big you are. And so can other people who will then take that and realize, I just saw the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob become my God. And I'm now willing to trust him in ways that I wasn't. And I'm willing to follow him in ways that I wasn't. And I'm willing to go where he says, because I've seen him. Just like, Joe, I'd only heard about you before, but now I have seen you. I take back everything I believed. And I'm willing to go wherever you go. And that's the invitation for all of us. And so, you know, hey, thanks for hanging with us. Thanks for being on this journey with us, because it's a journey we've not arrived. For some people listening, we may be a little ahead of you. For other people, we may be way behind you. We don't know, but we're on this journey together. And anytime, by the way, you have questions about something we said, you can always send us an email, faithforward at cfcywire.org. We can talk about anything we just talked about here, something greater, any of our previous podcasts. Or if you're interested in knowing about menopause, you can also hit me up for that.
