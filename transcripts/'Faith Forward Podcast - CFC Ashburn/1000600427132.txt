Welcome back to the Faith Forward podcast, John Ackerman, Brian Bales is back. Hey, you know what? It was good having Mike here though. I do, I have to say, I do look in the camera sometimes and watch this and compare the grayness of the side of my head to the lack of grayness in the side of Mike's head and think to myself, father time, it is, it is unstoppable. So, but yeah, back, glad to be back. Glad to be back. Good to have you back. So we are still in this series on First Peter and that's not said as a, I can't believe we're still here. It's that there's still that much more to cover and we're circling back to suffering today as promised. So if you joined us last week, we talked a little bit about deep love and cheerfully offering ourselves to others, which actually involves a degree of suffering. And we're back here this week to talk about possibly the place of greatest discomfort, the place of greatest suffering possible within us as human beings. This is not going to be the external suffering conversation. This is going to be the deeply internal suffering conversation. So give us a quick preview of where we went on Sunday and then we'll dive into this. Sure. Well, as you know, whenever we do this Faith Forward podcast, we are taking what we heard on Sunday and moving into our lives. We are mostly focusing on the latter half of my sermon, my talk. If you were able to tune in as we asked you all to do, I spent some time at the beginning. I just want to talk about that if I can. You know, over and over again in the book of Peter, First Peter, Peter talks to different audiences and then he goes to everybody. The audience at the beginning of First Peter chapter five is a group of people referred to as elders. And I talked about that on Sunday and he talked specifically about how they're supposed to conduct themselves, how they are supposed to be different as leaders living like aliens and strangers than the culture of that time, by the way. And by the way, the culture of today, it's completely different. And one of the things I want to say here that I said on Sunday is, is that I know as a leader, I've not always done this well. I have made many, many mistakes. And as a church, I want the people who are part of Christian fellowship church. And I realized that you may be watching this podcast and not a part of Christian fellowship church. We love having you being a part. We love hearing from you. We love the opportunity to connect with you, whether it's this way or differently. But this is specifically for those people who may call this church, their local body of believers is that if there's ever a time where you're concerned about someone as a leadership, specifically me as the lead pastor, I want you to know that I exist under authority of other people in that you have a way to talk about maybe something that is difficult to talk about with an interaction with me. Now, hopefully I'm living in such a way that you feel comfortable always talking with me, but I also recognize that due to different backgrounds and due to different experiences, that may not be the best way for someone to do it. So I said it on Sunday, I put it, if you were local here or watching our online and you did, you put up our online bulletin or program, whatever we would call it, it gave you the names of all the board members here at church has 12 of them there. And I said on Sunday, and I say again here, if you feel like you need to talk to someone about something that I mentioned in first Peter chapter five at the beginning, and specifically my life and how it is or isn't in your opinion, lining up to that, I encourage you to email them and you can email them because to all of them board member team at CFC wire.org. That's board member team at CFC wire.org. And so I just say that I want to say that again, because I mean it. But also because as we got to the end of verse four, where it's moves from talking to people known as elders to everyone, I did say this, those ways that he calls a Christian leader in a church to live. There are good ways for us to live in no matter what leadership situation. While the audience was specifically there talking to elders, I think we could all grow from that no matter whether or not we are that or not. And so don't discount that. But really what he was doing is talking about this mind, this heart that we should have as leaders, as people, but then also everyone of humility. Humility, as you just said, in some ways is a much more internal thing that sometimes if, if we don't understand it, we will see it as bad suffering, but it does require a level of dying to yourself. And that's why I love this. When Peter said, clothe yourself in humility, it's this sort of idea of like, it's our uniform. It's our, I it's, it's what we're putting on. It's a way of thinking and living. And so it's a call to all of us. Some of the glue that holds it together to live humbly towards each other. And, um, and that is one of the ways that we can be the most like Jesus being an alien and a stranger. Jesus said, let this mind be in you. In Philippians chapter two to serve. We'll talk about that verse. He also said himself that the son of man came not to be served, but to serve, to be a servant. There's so much in this. Humility is one of the greatest ways that we can live like an alien and stranger and live like Jesus. And as we looked at the end, this is what happens when we do that. We won't be opposed by God, which that should make us pause and say, God actively opposes when we don't live humble lives, we're going to be given some grace that I'll talk more about next week, but you can just go to chapter five or 10 and talk about how that grace plays out. And by the way, we're not going to be unrewarded for this. We're going to be exalted about that. But I didn't have time, which is where we're going today in our talk to talk about how, and we rarely ever have time to get to all of these things. And today we may run out of time to the whole lot of stuff. So what I talked about on Sunday was the, what we're called to do be humble. But if we don't fundamentally understand what humility is and what it isn't, when we go to try to live out the how, it's going to be messed up. And so that's a lot of what we're going to talk about in this podcast today, what it is and what it isn't. And then this is how we take it forward. Instead of just saying, oh, I'm called to be humble, but if I have the wrong definition. So again, Sunday, it got part of the way. Hopefully we'll get the rest of the way now. Yeah, that's a great introduction. And what you were saying about leadership, I think is really important for us to think, to remember in the context of this, this topic of humility is that all of us have been given a place of power and authority in whatever form or fashion, right? You have a place of authority. You have a place where your will matters, where your yes is yes. And that may be as a sibling in a family unit where you have some degree of influence. That may be as a parent with children that may be as a colleague with other colleagues that may be as an employee with whatever customers you interact with. That may be as an employer over employees, right? That however far up the scale of hierarchy, we usually go. There's a place where all of us at whatever level we exist have been given some degree of power and authority. And so this call to humility, like you said, Peter specifically talking about elders there for a moment, but then there's this broader call. And I think it's one of the things that we can quickly lose sight of is when we begin to apply a larger call to specific audiences. And so even what he says about leaders, and this isn't one of those, everybody gets a trophy. Everybody's a leader kind of things, but you have authority and influence wherever you are in your life somewhere. And so this call to humble leadership, this call to servant leadership is for all. And so to make sure we're doing that well, we want to talk about what humility is and it's not. And we've often found it's easy to start sometimes with what things aren't. Partially because it just, it helps to clear the air. Yeah. And I have to get this ADD moment out of my head because I started laughing as soon as you talk about, you may have a position of authority and you gave different things and you started talking about an older sibling. I remember one, I have two children, they're about three years apart. And I remember one of the first times that we left them by themselves for a period of time where the older sibling tried to get the younger sibling when the younger sibling didn't do what the older sibling thought they should demand to do pushups. Which was hilarious because the next time it happened, the immediately younger sibling was like, can she make me do pushups? No, that is beyond her scope of authority, right? In this particular case. So I just had to get that out right a little bit. So let's, you know, when it says to be humble, clothe yourself with humility, that isn't a suggestion, that's an imperative. We often think of humility wrongly. In fact, when I talked on Sunday and I introduced it, one of the struggles we have internally with our flesh is that sometimes we think being humble means being humiliated, right? And when we think about humiliation, it can come in lots of different ways. There's one particular way that other people don't have to humiliate us. We humiliate ourselves. And I remember one of the first times that someone engaged me with the idea of self-hatred and they challenged me like, Brian, I feel like you've got some self-hatred. And I was like, that's a really strong word. I feel like I spoil myself a decent amount. I'm not sure that I hate myself. But contextually, what they were trying to say was that what I believed about myself did not line up to the truth about myself given to me by being a child of God. And so the way that I thought about myself was less valuable. And sometimes if I was really going to be honest, I didn't define myself at all the way God did. I define myself through performance. I define myself through so many things. And I wasn't living up to that, what other people expected of me. I really was down on myself. And then I could say, oh, well, maybe I do kind of not like myself in this moment. What does not like look like? Is that hatred? I don't know. And then moments were like, oh, no, I really hate this part of me. And not understanding that. So when we talk about what it means to be humble, it's not self-hatred. It's not self-condemnation. And by that, I love to say it's, we have this tendency to point out what is wrong before we see what's right. And that doesn't mean live in denial of what's wrong. But when you talk about pointing out your sins and shortcomings first, it misses something about grace, right? Is that trying to draw through that? Yeah. Yeah, it does. And so one of the first thing that pops to mind about this is when we devalue ourselves, right? We often take three, we rarely see ourselves clearly. That's just the truth. And so we miss the mark on both sides. And so one of the things that we miss in our attempt to not be prideful in our, in our striving after humility in the best way, in the best way that we know to do it is we minimize what God has deemed incredibly valuable, right? We were bought with a price. And the ransom that was paid to deliver us from the kingdom of darkness was the life of the son of God. You are not worthless. You are not worth less. You are insanely valuable. You are insanely valuable. If you were not, the price to ransom you would not have been so steep. And so it's things like that, that we have to keep in mind as we then talk about humility. Yeah. Right? This is not a bringing up from the dirt. This is having a clear perspective of the way that God sees us and the way that we're called to live. And so then from a self-condemnation standpoint, because we're often quick to try to drive ourselves back down, we're also quick to try to puff ourselves up, right? We fall off both ways. And there is, we're going to give you a number of quotes throughout this episode, because there's a lot of smart people that have said some really smart things. And so we're just going to play off of them. But Andrew Murray, who literally wrote a book on humility, said this, it's not sin that humbles most, but grace. And to the extent that you have experienced the grace of God in your life, the extent that you have felt it, lived it, breathed it, touched it, the extent to which you have been aware of just how much God has done that was undeserved. You know how humbling that is. You know how much that just makes you drop to your knees in gratitude and thankfulness and awe and wonder. And it does so much more than beating ourselves up over our sins do. Yeah. I love that. I want to then kind of maybe talk about if we're not self-hatred or self-condemnation, this is sort of false humility. We talk about taking faith forward a little bit, and I like to use this term a lot, like a little check inside of us. Like if you wonder, do you have a false humility in that way? Say you do something well, and it's objectively well. And someone comes up to you and you say, man, that was really good. Or woman, that was really good. And you're like, oh, you can't receive that. You can't. I mean, you're like, no. And because you don't, you have this tension of going on, like, well, if I received that was really good, that somehow I'm being prideful. Right. No, that's not necessarily the case. Or we don't think about ourselves in a way that can receive that. And so, you know, you're talking about some quotes, and I want to read a C.S. Lois quote here. Pleasure in being praised is not pride. For Christ will say to some, well done, thou good in faith, thou good in sin. Well done, thou good and faithful servant. Pause there. Could you imagine sometimes the way we might internally feel when someone's saying, hey, that was really good. And I know that. I know the feeling someone may have come up to me Sunday after the service and, oh, that was really good. And I know internally, see, because we've told you this before we record this before. And so if you're, you know, I know you're not watching this before, but I mean, they'll be if someone comes up, I know inside of me, it'll be kind of weird. Confession. I have a pretty common thing that I say, because I don't know how to deal with this super well. Like if someone says, Pastor Brian, and then they mentioned something gracious about the sermon. I'm like, well, I just downloaded it from the internet. I mean, that's usually what I say, and it's very deflective of me because I don't know how to receive it super well. And I'm getting better at that, but I wouldn't say that to Jesus. I mean, like if he went, well done, good and faithful servant, I'd be like, well, I downloaded it from the internet, right? I'd be like, wow. And what if God's using these people to speak in your life? And it matters. So there's nothing wrong to feel pleased when he says it. And in fact, we should be proud, right? In some ways, when he says it, but also the more that we understand this is, you know, CS Lewis then goes on to say, yes, pride is a perpetual temptation, but don't be too worried about it. It's not. I love that putting your focus on the right thing. As long as one knows one is proud, one is safe from the worst of pride. I was like, I read that, uh, when I read these notes you sent me and I don't, I don't recall that CS Lewis quote. Maybe I've read it before, but anyone who knows if there's ever a good quote and you don't know who said it, we just say CS Lewis, but this legit CS Lewis quote, like, okay, man, that that's a good way to keep that in check. Recognition that I can be, or that we can be prideful means that it's where it needs to be versus some of these other things. And so I think it's really important to understand what humility is not. It's not self-hatred. We're not condemning ourself. It isn't like, oh, I just downloaded from the internet, false humility sort of stuff, but we got to sort of take the next step. Yeah. Just because, and I don't know if you ever, I say this a lot of times when I meet people and if I have a chance to counsel with them, I'll say something like this. Even if your family put the dis in dysfunctional, it doesn't mean that you know what functional looks like. It just means you may know what dysfunctional looks like. You may know what you don't want it to look like, but you don't know how to frame it in a way of what you do want to look like. So understanding what humility is not, isn't enough if we don't have a proper understanding biblically of what it really is, because then we're not able to live out. So, um, I'm, I'm trying to like hurry today. I don't know if this is working or not. Thank you for the grace in this way, because we could do, we have a lot and I'm like, we're going to hurry so fast. We get through all of it and be done. But either way, um, let's talk about what humility is. You got another Andrew Murray quote, right? Yeah. And so sometimes it's helpful to begin with the end in mind, to not just begin with the practical steps. Here's step one, but to look down to the end of the road and see if we've gotten to where we were trying to get to, what does it look like? And so Andrew Murray, again, from his book titled Humility says, humility is the one indispensable condition of true fellowship with Jesus. In other words, this is the thing you can't leave home without in this journey with God. And C.S. Lewis follows it up with some, with a very similar line. He says, as long as you are proud, you cannot know God. Not like God won't engage with you, but you won't engage with God. You actually won't see your need for him. It goes back to the, Jesus says, well done, thou good and faithful servant. You're like, I know I am that good, right? You can swing too far in the other direction as well. Actually, Jesus, your praise is not sufficient. I did a much better job than you're giving me credit for, right? By the way, if you listen to this podcast out of context, please make sure you listen to the whole thing. That's one of those things that winds up getting quoted and put on the internet and somebody using it against you just the way you did it. Yeah, exactly. I loved it. I lived through 16 years of teenagers in public school. I'm used to being misquoted, but especially on tests. So here's what humility is. Fundamentally, it's a lack of comparison, and that might sound a little disruptive as a primary definition, depending on how you're accustomed to thinking about humility. Because again, we usually think of humility as being smaller, being quieter, being less noticed, and some of those things may from time to time be elements of how we carry out the call to humble serving. But the principal part of humility is not comparing ourselves to others and not comparing ourselves to God. You were saying that, and it's interesting that the story that Jesus tells in Luke 18 always pops in my head about the religious man. He was known as a Pharisee, but I think that's frankly irrelevant that he was religious. He knew a lot of truth, but he missed it significantly because when he came before God over and over again, his point is, I'm not like this person. I'm not like this person. I'm like this person. I'm like this person. And so the way that he got his identity, the way that he engaged humility was this way instead of, all right, well, God, what do you want me to be, right? And there, I think there can be times where we discover this is what God wants us to be, and notice the difference I'm going to use here, and it could be humbling, but not humility or humiliating, right? There's absolutely an aspect where we compare ourselves to God, and it should and will be humbling, but that isn't the same thing per se as humility, even though humbling, and sometimes there's a decent subset of that. I think I'm maybe making too much and just parsing these words, but I do think, you know, we think humility, we think humbling, right? There's this moment I'm going to feel horrible about myself or humiliation, and that isn't what we're trying to get at, especially when you talk about not comparing yourself to God because I think someone could hear that and go, well, of course I'm supposed to compare myself to God, right? But I think what we often do, and the more we become self-aware, the more we become aware of this, the less self-aware we are, the less we realize we do this, which is part of what C.S. Lewis was saying is the worst problem with pride is when you don't even realize you're proud. You go around thinking, man, I have no problem with pride, and he's like, man, you better watch out because that's when it's bad. But Jonathan Edwards, in an essay on humility, this is how he frames this idea of comparison both to others and to God. He says, a humble person is sensible of the small extent of his own knowledge and the great extent of his ignorance and of the small extent of his understanding as compared with the understanding of God. Because here's where we usually fall off. And again, if we're being honest, I have done this so many times just in the last couple of weeks where I am fairly confident I know better than God. I know I don't know better than God, but I feel like I know better than God. And if God would just do things the way that I would do things, we'd all find that this world works so much better. Yeah. Right? That's the opposite of humility, right? That's me elevating the small extent of my knowledge relative to the large extent of my ignorance and elevating my small degree of understanding and significantly diminishing God's omnipotence. And so that's where we run into problems with humility is that it's not primarily what we're doing. It's primarily an internal reality and it's an internal reality that thrives on comparison. Or if we're being humble, the lack thereof. C.S. Lewis said it another way. He said, may God's grace. And so we come back to that idea that grace is potentially the most humbling, beneficially humbling thing we can experience. May God's grace give you the necessary humility to deal with others. Try not to think much less speak of their sins. One's own are a much more profitable theme. And if on consideration one can find no faults on one's own side, then cry for mercy for this must be a most dangerous delusion. And so here again, we find that in this pursuit of humility, in this pursuit of humble service, of the call to humility, which is part of holy living, which rings throughout this book, that it's really just to stop comparing ourselves and to primarily focus on what God is doing in us, what God is calling us to do through his power, rather than thinking we can do it on our own and not looking at what God is calling us to do in comparison to what we think God is calling other people to do and evaluating it. It's just to not focus on comparison. Yeah. So humility is indispensable. It is that lack of comparison. And this is something that I was almost going to say, but then I read your notes and I was like, oh, I don't need to say it in my talk because we're going to say it here. It is defining it a little bit. And this is a classic definition and I love it. What humility is and isn't. Humility is actually thinking of yourself less, not thinking less of yourself. I want to say that again because I think it's really easy that you can just hear it and hear it the way you want to hear it. Clever wordplay sometimes goes right past. It does, right? So thinking of yourself less, not thinking less of yourself. John, you want to expound on that? So again, when people ask Jesus, what's the greatest commandment? What did he say? He said, love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, and love your neighbor as yourself. And then, you know, there's this other section in Matthew where he says, seek first the kingdom and God's righteousness, his character, right? His way and everything else will take care of itself. And so if we do that, you know what we're not going to spend a whole lot of time doing? Thinking about ourselves. Thinking about ourselves. Yeah. All right. So we said it's not thinking about ourselves, but I think then there's this temptation that comes into my life and I'm pretty sure other people's life. All right, though, if I'm not thinking about myself, that means I'm not looking out for myself. So if I'm not looking out for myself, who's going to be looking out for me? Because, you know, one of the misconceptions I've talked about on Sunday around why we struggle in our flesh with humility is, is that when we are humble and live the way Jesus wants, the results at some point is we're not going to be rewarded. We're going to be doormat. In fact, it's really interesting. Some of the translations of the fruits of the spirit, like whenever we always try to say them and we never get them right. Long time listeners of the podcast know that anytime that John and I try to do a list, specifically the fruits of the spirit, we always forget one. But what I found interesting when I was studying was, is that there are some translations that translate the word meekness to humbleness. And I think there's probably a lot of reasons they do that. They're not exactly the same, but they're close because the implication of meekness sometimes is doormat, like you get stepped on. And I think the implication sometimes, if I'm not looking out for myself, right, I'm going to get stepped on. In fact, in that culture, in the Roman culture, humility was actually not something to aspire to. It was thought of, you're going to get rolled on, all this is going to happen. And so it's this sort of idea that, that, you know, Peter is telling people to live like aliens and strangers and be humble, do the opposite. And they had to have this sort of tension inside to know, all right, well, what happens? And that's, again, what he promises, you know, as the results that humility, while it's willing and wholehearted obedience to whatever God asks us to do, we can be confident that we will be rewarded. But man, that's hard for me sometimes. Not only to believe that it'll actually happen, but I feel like the other tension then is, you know, humility is supposed to be its own reward, right? If you're being humble, expecting something, then you're not really being humble, are you? Yeah, that's a great point. Jesus throws us a giant curve ball on this and says, be humble, right? Don't compare yourself to others. Trust that I'm going to take care of you. You don't have to take care of yourself. You know, humble service, humility in your internal reality, not just in your outward expression. And oh, by the way, the rewards for this are phenomenal. In fact, the more humble you are, right? Because Jesus's disciples come to him, James and John in particular, right? And they loop their mother into this. Yeah, that was a great move on their part. I mean, from an earthly standpoint, a great move. Right, because who can say no to mom, right? And they get their mom to come to Jesus and beg Jesus on her son's behalf, give my sons, you know, the prime placement when you ascend to heaven, right? And the other disciples get wind of this and not like they hadn't already been haggling over which one of us is the greatest anyway. Jesus sent us all out. I did this, you did that. I love how you mentioned that, right? Because we tend to focus on James and John asking, but that text is very clear. They were all arguing about it. In fact, what we would say is James and John in our world, in our culture, they were the ones just bold enough to ask. Right, they at least owned it. Yeah, exactly. I'm just going to get there first because you're all going to come up with this idea eventually and I'm just going to beat you to it, right? And Jesus, as he so often does, is he takes us from our material world context and he shifts our vision to look at the kingdom. And he basically says this, your desire to be great is not wrong. There is nothing wrong with your desire to be great. The problem is the way you're trying to go about greatness. You want to know how to be great? It's this, be humble, serve, serve others. In fact, have you noticed that's what I'm doing and you've already recognized who I am. You've already recognized my greatness. You have no problem with who I am in the hierarchy of the cosmos and you're watching my example and you are continuing to elevate me higher and higher with every day that passes and every miracle performed, every word taught. And so just do what I'm doing, do what I'm doing. And so this is the secret for us. How do we become humble? We do what he does and what he does, it's that time in the show. He asks God, he asks God, right? Jesus says, I only do what I see the father doing and I only say what I hear the father saying, right? So if Jesus is the epitome of humility, humble service, thinking less. About himself, thinking of himself less, he's thinking of his father and the kingdom more, and so he's doing whatever he is asked to do. And I love that emphasis that you keep doing either on purpose or by accident. I'm probably just hearing in my own head less. That doesn't mean not thinking of yourself. It just means positionally less behind God. You think of it this way, Jesus was actually pretty clear in the garden when he said, if it's possible, let this cup pass from me. You look at that and like he understood what he was about to go through. Then he said, nevertheless, not my will, but your will be done. So this call to humility isn't all of a sudden, we're like, I don't think about this. What it's what we're, whatever we think about ourselves and submit is in submission to whatever he is thinking about us. And what he is asking. And there are some things I think that we can read from scripture and we know, obviously, this is what he thinks about us. But when we get to that time in the show where you say, ask God, there's usually a very specific reason behind it. Not, not always. Other than the fact, it's always good to ask God. That's a good reason, right? But many times we're asking along the how, not the what, right? How do I think less about myself? And more about you? How do I live out this call that you've commanded very clearly in scripture? How do I do those sorts of, or God, how do I actually begin to feel about myself the way that you say that I am in that way? And that's where the living active power of God matters. Now, if you've listened to the show before, I'm going to tangent just for a moment. I wouldn't say if you let me, I was like, you know, you were going to let me anyway. I want to be really clear. The Bible contains the words of God, the power in the words, not in the leather, the power in the words, not in the print, because they contain the words of God. And we as believers have the very spirit of God in us, which will never contradict the infallible words here, but don't miss that. The words of God still exists coming into your life through his spirit. And he wants to guide us. He wants to show us, he wants to help us. What does it look like to be humble and look like you? It doesn't mean we don't think about ourselves. It just means we, in some cases present ourselves, but say, nevertheless, right. And be willing to receive that knowing this idea that if Jesus loves me enough to die for me, he loves me enough to get, that's the gospel, right? That he's not going to call me into something that whether I see it or not is actually not going to be loving and good for me. I just got to make that connection somehow. And sometimes this side of eternity, we don't know how to make that because our thoughts aren't his thoughts. Our ways aren't his ways. We just got to trust him. Yeah. So, all right. Sidebar over. No, that was good. That was good. And again, we look at the model, not only that Jesus sets for us, but we look at the way that God engaged with his son as a model for how God will engage with all of his other children, right? And you look at the things that God specifically and overtly said to Jesus during his lifetime. And on two separate occasions, once at the beginning of ministry and once near the end of his life, God in two cases speaks audibly for all to hear. This is my beloved son in whom I am well-pleased as he's baptized in the Jordan and on the Mount of Transfiguration. God speaks twice for all those around Jesus, as well as for Jesus to hear. And the thing that God speaks to is his identity. This is who you are. And when you know who you are, you actually don't have to think about yourself as often because you know it. It is so deeply stable inside of you that you don't spend a large part of your day wondering, am I good enough? Do I have what it takes? Am I working hard enough? Am I being humble enough? Am I serving enough? Am I too proud? Am I, right? When you know at your core, and not because you've worked it out yourself, but because your heavenly father has spoken it to you so frequently that you know it by heart, you don't spend nearly as much time wondering about who you are because you know it. And so that has to be part of the foundation that Jesus works off of. He knows at his core who he is, right? And you see when he's baptized in the Jordan and God says that, and then sends his son into the wilderness to be tempted, and Satan shows up to tempt him, his first accusation is, if you're the son of God, right? It comes in the place of Jesus's identity. And Jesus is able to shrug it off, like, nice try, dude. I know exactly who I am. And oh, by the way, I don't need to turn these stones into bread because I don't live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from my father, right? This isn't a one-time thing. This is an ongoing lifeline. You got nothing on me, Jack, right? You can't disrupt this because I know who I am and I know who he is. I'm not thinking about myself. I'm not thinking about the things you're offering me. I know who I am and I know what he's called me to do, to do the things he's asking me to do. Not this plan I've worked up in my head that I think will please him. I know what to do because he's telling me what to do. So how do we become humble? Wholehearted obedience. Ask God. Ask God what to do. And don't ask God for the 10-year plan now to then go operate off of apart from God. Ask God today about today. And then as you go, ask God about you. Who do you say I am? And look through the scriptures to see what God has already said about you as his child, as his adopted one, as his co-heir, as the one that he moved heaven and earth for and ransomed to return back to him. But then also listen for what he has to say about you because he has something to say to you about who you are. There was another pastor that I heard say this, I can't afford to have any thought about myself that God doesn't have about me. That'll take care of humility right there. If you know the things that God says about you and you don't have any other extraneous thoughts about you, boom, humble. You're done. Except you're not really done because it's a lifelong process, but you get what I mean. Yeah. You got the process, you just gotta apply it. You got the process and this is a process. This is not a one and done, right? Because we also have a living and active enemy who is defeated ultimately, but he's still wreaking havoc. Which interestingly enough, I mean, we go to verse seven this week and verse eight is exactly that verse that we're going to talk about that we do have a living and active enemy, an adversary that is, you know, in that analogy, like a lion looking in. So it's real and I think that when we begin to walk through the model of Jesus just over and over and over and over again, the one person who would, I think we'd all agree, would have the right not to be humble, God in the flesh, having all the spirit of God in him, listening to perfectly all the time. So this is why I'm here. And, you know, I didn't come, you know, I mentioned it earlier on, you've mentioned the argument, you know, that James and John, when they came in Mark to Jesus and used their mom again, and, you know, he really takes that moment and says, no, but then reorients what it means to be a person that follows after him, you know, a person, anyone in authority is that the first shall be last and last shall be first is another verse that's used there. But it's just talking about that. You must be willing to serve everyone. Like if God's given you this, it's not meant to lord it over. It's meant to understand first off, and this is a good step for humanity, by the way, you realize anything you have, isn't really yours. It's from God in the first place, your resources, your talents, your intelligence, all of that sort of stuff. You may have honed them a little bit, but they're not yours. They're not yours. And it keeps it in check. Remembering as it says in Philippians chapter one, verse 27, where our citizenship is, right? We've talked about this again. We aren't citizens of earth. We are citizens of heaven. But in this world is where we live right now. And, you know, there's so many other things. Philippians chapter one, verse 29. When he wrote this first down, I'd forgotten about it. Truthfully, I'm sure I'd come across it at some point or another, and maybe I conveniently forgot about it. For you've been given not only the privilege of trusting in Christ. Okay. All right. Okay. I can get my head around that. But also the privilege of suffering for him. Wow. You mean, and that's one of the things like I could live a humble life and live the way he's called me to live. And as a result, I'm going to suffer this side of eternity. And the answer to that is yes. But the answer again, as we'll get to the end in chapter five, or we've already talked about, there's nothing that we will ever suffer this side of eternity that we can't be guaranteed as we talked about before with Peter and Paul, that God will not repay a hundredfold and more. We might see some of this side of eternity. We might not, but God is true and he's faithful. Philippians chapter two, verse one. Is there any encouragement from a longing to Christ? Any comfort from his love, any fellowship together in the spirit? Are your hearts tender and compassionate? Then make me truly happy by agreeing wholeheartedly with each other, loving one another and working together with one mind and purpose. Do not be selfish. Don't try to impress others. Be humble. Be humble. Think of others as better than yourself. Don't look only for your own interests, but take an interest in others to have the same attitude that Christ Jesus had. And this is, you know, part of what I quoted a little bit on Sunday. Have the same mind though. He was God. He did not think of equality with God as something to cling to, to Lord over, to, to rule over people. Instead, he gave those divine privileges up. He took the humble position of a slave and he was born as a human being. When he appeared in human form, he humbled himself. There's that word again, in obedience to God and died a criminal's death on the cross. And here's this. Therefore, God highly exalted him or elevated him to the place of highest honor and gave him the name above all other names. The name of Jesus, every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue declare that Jesus is Lord to glory of God and the father. I kind of got my versions mixed up. I learned it in the King James, but whether I translate it and say it in one or the other, the truth is still there. That God does reward the humble. Jesus is the ultimate example. And so maybe some categories to think about. As I got to the end of my talk, I actually used the term a moment of asking God, you know, about this, like, where does this need to be applied? And then in light of what you've told me, how do you want to live? And there's some categories I think that naturally come to mind. They're not exclusive. Yeah. Places to start. Some of the things that you jotted down, I'm interested, the ones that you jotted down why I had the same internal list in some ways, which means that that's probably something that all of us probably have on our list, but what are they? Yeah. So if we're called to live differently, we're called to live differently no matter what our roles are. Right. And so just like we talked about at the beginning that all of us are called to places of authority. We can all figure out how to live in humility in our places of leadership, whatever those are, and we can't figure out how to do that on our own, right? We have to be taught humility. Humility does not come naturally to us. We said at the top of the show that this might be the most significant week of suffering because this is the death of self, right? This is putting to death the prideful self, the flesh, as the scriptures talk about it, the part of us that wants to be our own little G God. And so we have to be taught to follow the example of Christ. It's part of why he came, not just to pay the ransom, but to teach us how to live his way, right? We need to be taught. We do not intuitively know this. And so we need him to show us how to live in humility as leaders in whatever place we've been given authority and influence. And so if that's at your place of employment where you collect a paycheck, ask him, what would it look like for me practically, tactically to grow in humility here? And if you have authority over people, ask him what it would look like for me to be a humble servant of people that I lead, of people that I serve. And if you are one under authority, ask him what it would look like to be humble in that service and then do the same in your marriage, right? We are called to marriage where we submit to each other and submission and humility go hand in hand and both make us really uncomfortable and both make our spiritual flesh crawl and want to run in the opposite direction. And this could be a whole podcast all by itself. What does this look like in marriage? Yeah, I think one of the ways it works, look like in marriage is being more focused on the relationship than being right. And I'm talking about right. I'm not talking about biblical right. I'm like, right, because I just enjoy doing it this way or doesn't everybody, you know, I think there's so much dying to self when you get into relationships for some of us, myself included. We didn't realize people did something differently than us until we got married. And then all of a sudden we realize, well, there's a reason we do it this way. It's because we like it. And now I've got to do it a different way. And it's hard to submit. And, and these are things that are just day in and day out stuff like how you do a dishwasher, like how you do a dishwasher, not the bigger, larger things. And in one of the practical things, I think to learn how to be humble in your marriage is to say outside of biblical stuff, I'm much more concerned about the relationship I developed with this person than being right. Yeah. Yeah. Thinking of yourself less at that, that version in Philippians that you read earlier, don't look out only for your own interests, but take an interest in others to be humble, thinking of others as better than yourselves. It's the both. You do matter. You are not a doormat because you were bought with an incalculable price. And so was the other person. And then finally, not that this is the exhaustive list, but we're just out of time. What would it look like to grow in humility in our friendships? And I have a hunch that it would look very similar to what it would look like to grow in humility in our marriages and in our workplaces, right? Because it doesn't look that dissimilar from location to location, right? Because this is not about what we do. It's about who we're becoming. It's about our internal reality, not our external works. But our external works are shaped by our internal reality. And so this is the call. This is the call to holy living. This is the call to humble living. And it's hard. And it's going to require the death of some things inside of us that really don't want to die. And so again, we cannot get there on our own. We need help. We need people around us that are willing to help us see ourselves when we don't see clearly. And more than anything else, we need to cultivate a relationship with our living and active father who sees us the most clearly because he made us and can show us the things that are good and worthy of praise, which is part of humility is knowing your worth. Not thinking less of yourself, simply thinking of yourself less because you know who you are and your eyes are fixed on God and his kingdom. There's a lot more we could say, but there you go. Hey, since I said there's a lot more that we could say, the assumption of that is, is probably a lot more you can say too. And so we want to tell you all the time, this is a two way conversation, maybe not through the video screen, but certainly through conversations via the phone or as we say, just every week, we'd love to talk to you. And the best way to get either one of us, we both get the emails is to send us one at faithforwardatcfcy.org and, um, let's pick up this conversation again about this call to humility, to clothe ourselves in a way that, that isn't really easy, but it's really, really the way he calls us live as aliens and strangers. So until next time, when believe it or not, we're going to talk about suffering some more. There you go.
