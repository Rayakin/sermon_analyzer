Welcome back to the Faith Forward Podcast, John Ackerman, Brian Bales, and we're in this second week of a series we're calling Heartbeat, getting to the deeper sense of God's desire and God's design for us in this relationship that we get to have with Him. Yeah. So, Brian, if you wanna give us a quick recap from last week for those that might've missed it and are just catching us here for the first time, and then we'll talk a little bit about where we're going today, because where we're going today is fun. Yeah, it is going to be fun, and both week one, if you've not listened to that at CFC Wired, that's our website, cfcwired.org, we encourage you to do that, not that you can't engage just without it, or week two, because both of these weeks are building upon the very most basic thing around understanding God's heartbeat for us, and that is that everyone is redeemed, number one, and then after that, that everyone lives from the reality of that redemption. And just because, as I said last week, we know something doesn't mean we always live from it. Just we have an intellectual idea around something, or even an experience around something, like I threw my back out, I had that experience, intellectual idea, it doesn't mean I'm always the person that remembers that and lives from it. And so this week, as we dove into this idea around what redemption gives us again, here's the heartbeat of God, to live from that redemption, everyone's redeemed, live from it, we talked about that redemption as children of God gives us two other things. Not just two things, but two other things. One is power, and the other is purpose. Now next week, we're going to get even more to how to live from that power. I just introduced the idea of power really a lot this week on Sunday, and then talked more around purpose, and then gave some diagnostics at the end of the time together to begin to understand our purpose a little bit, and we brought in, of course, like we do on Sunday, but always on this podcast, Ask God, that's the easiest way to find it out. But we began to talk about this idea that because our purpose is unique, Ephesians 2, that we were created for good works, before the foundation of the earth, that we should walk in them. And I always love that, because should means that there's an opportunity that we want. And a lot of times, us not walking in our unique purpose, if you call this a workmanship, where God's workmanship, a piece of art, unique, it comes from the fact that it's ignorance. We just haven't taken the time in some ways to understand some deeper parts about how God has made us, and how he has created us, and what he's gifted with. And so in some of that, we're going to have a little bit of even some more set up for this podcast in just a moment that we didn't have it on Sunday, because there's a lot of confusion around like, well, is this a spiritual gift that God's given me that I'm supposed to practice? Well, is this just a talent that I've had, or is this a skill, or whatever it might be? And the bottom line is, we're going to say, it might not matter which one of the three, but we'll give a little bit of that. But then we're definitely going to get into, look, once we begin to understand this and try to walk in the purpose, the unique way that God has made us to live out the general purpose, that is to give him glory and tell others about him, there's some traps that we can easily fall into. So we're going to give a few diagnostics around this if we can. I love using that word. It just feels so, I don't know, it feels technical, but powerful, I guess. And then we're going to do some real faith-forward stuff, how to take our faith forward on that. Absolutely. Because I think one of the challenges that people have sometimes when they hear this idea of God has a purpose for your life, it's like, I better not screw this up. Or how do I find it? Like I now have to go through all the different sections at Barnes & Noble to figure out which specific book and which specific section is the one that I'm supposed to read for the, it just feels like needle in a haystack kind of stuff. So what we put together is just some of the things that I've found personally helpful for me and that I've found helpful helping people navigate this topic of purpose and gifting and passion and personality, all the things that make up the you that God meant when he meant you and placed you in a specific context to go and do things that he's designed you to do. So one of the first things like you said that I've seen people trip over is, what do you mean by gift? What does that word mean? And it gets so easily conflated because of our life experience with these other words that seem to be synonymous, skill and talent. And we're not going to dedicate a whole lot of time to really parsing and defining each of those. But honestly, this was a little bit of a new revelation for me as I was throwing these notes together. I came across somebody else who was talking about the difference between these three categories. And they said, look, when it comes down to it, here's the fundamental difference between a gifting and the other two, that a gifting requires a recipient. Yes. And the basis of that is if we go into the sections of scripture that talk about we're talking about gifting, we're talking about spiritual gifts. So just in case, maybe I need even back up just a little bit, is that scripture tells us that upon the time of our redemption, one of the things that happens is we're given the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit, the spirit of God in us, gives us particular giftings. We can look into 1 Corinthians chapter 12, verse 11 is very specific. The Holy Spirit gives it. Ephesians chapter 4 talks about Jesus giving those gifts. It's the spirit of Jesus in us. And then there's Romans chapter 12 that that talks about that. So when we talk about giftings, here's what you need to know. No matter what you think, if you have a relationship with Jesus Christ and you've been redeemed, you have at least one. Yeah, because that's what scripture says. Doesn't mean we're living from that one, but we have at least one. And so that's an important thing. If you talk about giftings like, oh, what do you mean by that? And that sort of separates something out a little bit from maybe something that was you were just born with. It doesn't mean that God didn't create us in our womb. It doesn't mean he has uniquely and wonderfully made us. But there's a difference between it's something that you got at your first birth. And I'm going to use another term. And then at your second birth, which is what lots of times people call our salvation being redeemed, it comes from the discussion of Nicodemus in the book of John. Unless you're born again, a second birth, we get some additional stuff. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, everything you have in you got put there. Yep. Right. And so for some of this, it's maybe it feels like we're splitting hairs. But the fundamental distinction with spiritual gifts, one, spiritual giftings require a recipient. And so if you look at the list of giftings described in those three sections of scriptures that you just laid out. And by the way, thanks for getting me back on topic because I knew I started talking and I missed something when I came back around. The reason the Holy Spirit gives us, it says in First Corinthians chapter 12, is to build up the church, to build up others. Right. So it's very specific in there. So thank you for clarifying that. But I think it's one of those times where we sometimes lose track of the whole verse. Yeah. Right. We stop at the list of the giftings or we just pull those out and we then quickly start trying to identify what's my gift, what somebody else's gift. And we start using it like one of those online personality tests to tell us, what am I supposed to do? Right. It's trying to help us navigate that Barnes and Noble section. Yes. To zero us in. And so what was so helpful for me in this moment was zooming back out and realizing every single one of these giftings found in all three sections of scripture, Apostle, prophet, teacher, miracles, healings, health, administration, word of wisdom, word of knowledge, faith, discernment, tongues, interpretation, tongues, love. That's all. First Corinthians 12, Ephesians 4, Apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers, Romans 12, prophecy, service, teacher, exhortation, giving leadership, mercy. You can go back and play that at half speed or quarter speed if you want to, or just go look up the description or email to Faith Forward at CFCY to send you the list. Right. Every single one of those requires an other. None of those can be done in isolation. You physically can't function out of those giftings by yourself, away from people. You can't use those giftings for yourself. And so therein lies the fundamental difference between a spiritual gifting and anything else, talent, skill, whatever you want to call it, is that it's not only placed in you by God because so are your talents, your inborn abilities, but also the things that you could cultivate over time, your skills. Spiritual gifts are not only placed in you by God, but they're empowered by God. You can't cultivate it on your own apart from God. You can't will it into existence apart from him. And it's matured in you by God because God will make sure that the gifts that he's placed in you are given spaces to be utilized, to be harnessed, to be honed. Right. Because that's why he gave them to you, because they weren't just for you. They were for all of his other kids and the parts of his creation that he contextually placed you. Here's the last thing about spiritual gifting. You know that some of the things you're good at, you hate doing. Yes. I'm good, reasonably speaking, at Excel. I like spreadsheets. If that was my nine to five, I wouldn't make it two weeks. And I think this is a great place where we talk about sometimes God uses our talents to then support our giftings. So here's an example. Nowhere in scripture does it mention the talent of construction. But we've met some people say they're gifted at it, John, you're gifted at it. But it doesn't mean that God can't use his talent of construction for you not to live out your gifting as helps. And so I'm going to go help someone by using my talent of construction. Or if you're watching this on YouTube, a lot of people don't know this. John, after we get done talking, he goes and he kind of pieces this all together between the audio and the video and all of that. John would say it's not something that he deeply enjoys doing, but it supports one of the giftings that God has given John teaching. And it's a way to get it out there and also helping other people on that. So if you look at even these lists and go, well, how come I can do this? This isn't in there. There's a good chance it's a talent and it's not like God isn't saying it's not important. It may be even a skill. It's not like God's not saying it's important. It's that here's how does it live out through this gifting? Cause that's when you help others. Cause you're right now, your, your skill of construction is helping you. It is helping you now. It's also the help to other people. Cause I know that you and Brooke, that's his wife. If you haven't picked this up over the times of our podcast, uh, invite people over and use that place that God has blessed you with to help others and serve them. Yep. So this may be a helpful starting point, right? If you've been trying to figure out what are my giftings, it's maybe helpful. And as we always say, and you said it once already or someone, one of these times, we're going to do like a little board up here and keep track of the number of times that we say, ask God. But if you're not sure, this is not necessarily something you need to go figure out for yourself, right? God placed it in you. He wants to talk to you about this. And so ask him to show you the gifts that he's placed in you. But this is also a good space to ask others. The people that know you well often see your giftings in some cases more clearly than you do, because for you, they're normal, right? And you've seen this with people that have skills and talents and other places that it's just, they're normal. And so they don't recognize that there's anything special about it because they've either never lived without it, or it came so naturally to them that they assume, well, if other people wanted to do this, they'd probably pick it up as quick as I would. And so sometimes other people have a much clearer picture of your giftings than you do. But then we also offer, and by we, I mean humanity, because we've been at this for a while. There's a wide variety of tools, of assessments, of resources that act as sort of a neutral third party that help you hone in on, huh, I guess I am good at this. Yeah. And one of those we talked about on Sunday, we made available both in the printout handout or the online bulletin. So if you're watching this later on, and it's in the week of our service, you can go to cfcwire.org, go to the top of the page, hit the online bulletin, and in there, there'll be a QR code that takes you to one that we often use here at Christian Fellowship Church. In fact, it's the one that's the basis for discussion. And another thing that we do called square one here at Christian Fellowship Church in week three, we spend a lot of time going through this, helping discover how God has uniquely made you in order to live out this purpose of serving others. Yeah. So those are all good places to start. Once we start though, because the goal in this is not just awareness. We've talked before, awareness isn't healing when we're talking about recovery. We're talking about purpose. Awareness of your purpose isn't living out your purpose, but it's a necessary first step. And so perhaps just better understanding your giftings and your talents and your skills, that's a necessary first step. But then what often happens is we try to live out our purpose is we run into some pitfalls. And so for the rest of our time, we wanted to touch on some of them that either we've experienced or we see, we see people commonly experiencing. And the first one is this, and man, this is a big one in the church. One of the things that most often keeps us from living out our purpose is this feeling that I have to do it for God rather than from God. Yep. And that'll cause you all kinds of problems. Because if you notice the root of that, the source of living out that purpose, if you're doing it for God, then the power of that is you. If you're doing it from God, then the power is him. And if we go back to where our spiritual gifts came from in the first place, it wasn't anything we cultivated on our own. It was something that he placed in us and honed and matured in us. And so that has to matter as we're thinking about how we live out our purpose. And I think one of the interesting things about when we talk about doing things for God versus from God, for a period of time, it can seem and feel synonymous. They're the same thing. But two thoughts, number one, if you ever have this thought that if I don't use or don't do blank, then somehow God won't accomplish blank. Right. You're doing this for God instead of from God. That's Acts chapter 17, verse 24 and 25. Like the God who created the universe needs anything from human hands. And maybe we wouldn't say that out loud, but if you've ever internally had this moment where you said, man, if I don't do this, the kingdom of God is going to fail. We would never say that, but this isn't going to happen, or this isn't going to happen, or this isn't going to happen. Now it doesn't mean that there won't be a change in things if you won't, but God's purpose will still occur. He'll still be there. That's an insight that maybe you're trying to do it for God instead of from him. The second one that I've experienced in my life is if I don't do this, somehow God will love me less. Like I'm doing this and living from the gift he gave me. And we're going to talk about this later in the series, as I alluded to last week and alluded to here, I'm using this gift so I can stay in good relationship. Like I have to do this or God's going to be mad at me. I have to do this or God's not going to care about me. And it doesn't mean that our relationships don't go up and down with God from time to time. It never changes in the fact that if we ever, uh, the son of God spirit in us that we've accepted what Jesus has done, that we're always a son or we're always a daughter, but eh, you know, sometimes we're closer in that relationship than others. It'll have that effect, but it doesn't change God's fundamental love for us. It doesn't change God's fundamental care for lots of reasons. We can say that, but not the least of which God saved us knowing everything we have done are doing and will do. And he's like, I'm still going to save you. So it's not going to change that. And so if either one of those thoughts resonate with you right now, or maybe resonated, you'll discover that you're most likely doing it for God instead of from God. And then I think there's also this third aspect that I got to be careful around. And it's the aspect of fatigue. Yeah. So doing things for God often winds up in burnout over over used idea of duty. Cause we're supposed to respond to him, but it's an overused sense. That's what motivates everything duty instead of love. I don't know if I said that well, but hopefully you got what I mean. If not, just send me an email, but also this idea of just exhaustion. And I know this is, this is me. I can feel that. And in fact, one of the reasons that we talked about last year, and we continue to bring up here at Christian Fellowship Church, the rhythm of celebration, which implied that is the rhythm of rest is that you, number one, we need that rest. And number two, in living from that rest, we're allowing God to do what we're not doing. It's proving we don't have to do it for him, right? We have to do it from him because God doesn't need anything from us. But here's the thing that blows me away. And John, I'm going to pass it back to you because I know there's so many things that you love to talk about. This is one of them though, that God doesn't need anything from us. He needs not to do anything for us, but strangely enough, as it says there in Acts 17, he wants to do things with us. Yeah. God, there's so many things, you know, some of it is you see it in Genesis, right? The way that God chose to create the world. He did pretty much all the work before humanity ever showed up. And then on Adam and Eve's first day, what was God's invitation to do? Rest, right? Their first hours of life was spent in Sabbath. Yeah. So there's that piece, right? Just as the reminder that we were made for Eden, we were made for paradise. And the way that paradise functioned was God did all the creative work and then invited us into it to enjoy it, to delight in it and to steward it, to continue the process of cultivating, but not in a way that separates God from that process, but in a way that was invitational, right? Walking with God in the cool of the day. Yep. That's never changed. Another piece of this, and again, there's so many facets of this that I feel like we could talk about, but you can't do anything apart from him anyway. I think the verse says this, apart from me, you can do nothing. Now it's escaping me. That is in the Bible. Just Google it. This is getting me the reference, but it is this idea. It's in the gospels that you can't do anything from God. You can fool yourself into thinking you're doing something from God. If there is success and it's separate from God, it won't be long-term or if there's success, maybe he just came along and you know, that whole footprints thing, I was carrying you in that moment. Yeah. So there's the recognition of, of our limitation as a human being, but then there's also, if Jesus is the model, right. And that's not a conditional, if it's, you know, Jesus is the model. Jesus said, I only do what I see the father do. And I only say what I hear the father say, right? That's the model. That's what he lived from God as source of power, as source of information, as source of gifting. That's the model. There is nothing that Jesus did that he had to go run out and do for God. Yep. Right. God was making it happen, but his invitation, as it is to all of us, right, Jesus was the representation of God on earth, right? The physical manifestation of God. And in the other ways, he's also talked about as the second Adam. And if, if you're new to this podcast, there's things that John are saying that we've said before, but I just want to kind of go back and grab so you don't miss this. Okay. When Jesus didn't do anything, the father didn't tell him to do, or didn't say anything, the father didn't tell him to say what he was doing as the second Adam, right? That's what he is modeling from us, from his humanity. Cause it was fully God and fully man, how life was supposed to work with Adam and how life should work with us when we have the Holy spirit in us. So in doing that, he wasn't special because I think there's sometimes. Hear me, he was special, but he wasn't unique in the fact that he was modeling for us how to live. Cause I think sometimes we could look at Jesus and go, wow, that's Jesus. And he's pulling out the God card here. Right. That's the exact opposite as God. He's living as a human and showing us this is how you're supposed to live. Yeah. Yeah. And, and so that, that has to be something we keep in the forefront of our mind that this is how we were designed to live, doing things with God and from God, not separate from God and trying to earn our way back by doing things for him, like you talked about before, I think something else that gets in the way is confusing the gifting with the execution of our gifting. Okay. And so here's what I mean by that. And this is one of the things that we talked briefly about in our square one class, but your gifting is what you are called to do. You talked on Sunday about part of what happens when we are redeemed is that we are empowered and we are given a purpose, right? There's something that's supposed to happen in us and through us as a result of this reconnection to God. And so our gifting is, is what we're called to do. It's what we're called to bring to the world, but your passion is where you do it and why you do it. Right. So one of my giftings is as a teacher, right? Teaching is a gifting, but anybody that ever came through school anywhere recognize that the gift of teaching can look a lot of different ways, right? Kindergarten teachers versus middle school teachers versus high school teachers versus college professors versus coaches versus professional trainers. All of those people have the potential to have the gifting of teaching. I was not made for a kindergarten classroom. It just wasn't. My wife was a middle school teacher. I was a high school teacher and we would often look at each other and go, I don't know how you do it. And then we'd both go on vacation and meet an elementary school teacher and buy them dinner because neither one of us knew how they did it. Right. That wasn't our passion. We had the same gifting, but where we did it and why we didn't look fundamentally different for a reason. And then there's your personality, how you do it. This is more than just introvert and extrovert, but that's a healthy place to start sometimes. Right. God made you the way that you are for a reason. And so your gifting, what you do coupled with your passion, where you do it, with whom you do it, your motivation for it, why you care so much about that particular group of people or that cause is then tied in with your personality and the way that you do it. And again, if you want to go introvert, extrovert, it's, it's why some teachers are really good. If I'm just going to stick with my gift of teaching, some are really good in a small space because they're just really good at that intimate personal relationship, whereas others have the energy and the charisma to capture whole rooms and you put that introverted personality in a large space and it doesn't play the same, but you put that extroverted personality in a small space and you run over the very person you're trying to teach. And so all of this matters. Yeah. And I think to go back to this idea of one of the traps that we can easily fall into, especially early on when we're discovering the giftings that God has given us and we then connect with someone who has the same spiritual gifting. There's a lot of overlaps. John and I have a lot of the same spiritual giftings. We have some differences as well, but I think one of the traps is as we're beginning to understand our giftings, we might get around someone else who has that gifting and begin to then think, I have to do the how the same way they do the how, and that's misunderstanding personality. And that's even in some ways, misunderstanding passion. Cause I love the fact that you brought in coaching, you brought in, you know, training, you brought in all kinds of other ways that are teaching outside of a professional classroom or outside of a church environment, because let's go back to you, people know this, watch the podcast, right? John used to be in a high school. That is because his gifting from God is teaching, but his passion about the where and the why that switched to here to the church got John wasn't any more in the will of God at his high school than he is here. But when God said, well, I want to switch the where and the why then that's when you listen to God and how do you live out your purpose? But I was remembering when I was first exposed, you know, all right, maybe that God's given me the gift of teaching. And I had some spiritual mentors in my life. I don't know that they would have called themselves that, but they were farther up the food chain where I worked than I was. They were my bosses. They were the, the main communicators at the places that I worked and they were good. And I think the first five years of me in ministry, you would have said I was a really, really, really, really, really bad version of new Larson, who was my boss, who was amazingly good, but I was like, oh, he's so effective in his teaching. Maybe I need to do it this way. Then the next four or five years, I was a really, really, really, really bad version of Michael Easley. And only that's not good. He was my boss too. And he was really great. Still really great. Then only it wasn't about three years. I think into when I actually did that job just as much as they did to actually found, oh, well, God wanted to use some of this and some of this, but he's also maybe this way in this is how I'm going to live it out. In fact, there's some time to times people would come to me and they would say something gracious, like, man, I really like how you do blank and so-and-so doesn't do blank. They're not trying to say something negative, but sometimes we say something negative, say something positive to other people. And one of the things I'll try to say is, but they're not supposed to be me. They're supposed to be somebody else. Yeah, we are supposed to be somebody else, but I think, and here again, there's almost a trap within a trap, right? This is like Inception, by the way, it's pretty good. It is. We're going to spin a top here in a second. There has to be a place to start, right? As you begin to live out of your giftings, as you begin to cultivate your giftings, there has to be a place to start, right? The basic idea of discipleship is that you become like the one you're learning from. And so as God invites us to start cultivating our giftings, there's a learning process that occurs. And so of course we initially mimic the ones that we're learning from, the people we've seen do it well. Yep. You know, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, right? And yet at some point, and I've heard you talk about this as well, like it took you a while to find you. It took you a while to find your voice. It took you a while to find yourself as this particular embodiment of a gifting. And so it is for all of us. And the trap is we never get out of that place of comparison. Yes. Or the trap is we completely reject any attempts to be cultivated, any attempts to be discipled. No, I'm going to go out on my own. I'm not going to be like anybody else. Yes. And you make your road a lot harder in some cases, because again, the goal is to only do what God is doing and only say what God is saying. Go ahead. Yeah, no, go ahead. And so this again is where we start to fall back into one of those earlier traps of doing things for God rather than from him. There are times where our giftings need to operate in a place of development. And there's a times, you know, Jesus with the disciples, there's times of sending out and there's times of coming back. There's times for your gifts to be tested. There's times for your gifts to be tested away from the people whom you've either modeled yourself after or who have been directly instructing you. There's times to go see, how does this thing work? But you were never meant to do it alone. Yeah. And so can I add like another sort of trap that can be fallen in that we didn't put in our notes that it just reminded me of though, especially when we look at some of these things in first Corinthians 12, Ephesians four, Romans chapter 12 in the spiritual giftings. Yeah. No one has all of them. No, no one has all of them. And I think a trap can be, once we begin to learn our spiritual giftings, we might easily begin to say, well, if I don't have that gifting, I don't need to do that. And maybe in some cases that are true, if you don't have the gifting of tongues, you don't need to have the gifting of tongues. Sure. There's no command of that, but there is a command of service in scripture. Yep. So even if you don't have the gift of service or the gift of helps, it doesn't mean like I'm out. And so just make sure that when we're beginning to walk through those spiritual gifts, we also understand the differences. There are some commands we need to, it says we're to exhort. We're to exhort each other. It says in Galatians, some people might be more spiritually gifted. We're supposed to share our faith, the gift of evangelism. I mentioned pastor Fred Clark all the time. Pastor Fred Clark on staff here is one of the most spiritually gifted evangelism people I know. I don't have that gift at that level that he has. And I can't go, well, I guess I don't need to share my faith because it still says it. And so that's another, that's an extreme trap. Once you get in it and say, oh, well, I only have to do the things that my gifting, there are some things that he's going to call us to do. And we may not be as natural at them, or we not may not have the results that we might want to have in a level that we might have different results if we're living from our giftings, but that's still something he's called us to do. And we have to trust God. It was just, I was thinking about that because I know for a while I knew someone who was very gifted at teaching and they looked at me one day and said, well, I don't really share my faith because it's not my gift. And I just had this moment. I'm like, I don't think that's, I don't think you, I don't think that means what you think it means to use, you know, a statement that we would both love from a movie. Yeah. Yeah. And so I think, you know, we could take all these traps and probably lump them into one of two categories, which is either the trap of running ahead without God or the trap of lagging behind or even just becoming paralyzed or apathetic, which then also ends up being without God. Right. And so for some of these things, it may be that the, the nuance of language itself has become a trap of, of paralysis and apathy. I'm not even sure I know what my gifting or my skill or my talent, whichever one of those things are, I don't even know. So I'm not going to do anything. And in some cases it might be, well, I don't think that's my gifting, so I'm not going to do anything. And in some cases it might be, I don't need anybody to tell me anything about my gifting. I'm off and running and God better rein me in if he wants me to slow down. Right. Like there's dysfunction on both sides. And so one of the other things that we have to put in upfront, and I say upfront halfway through the show is possibly the largest trap. Yeah. I think this might be the largest trap is ignoring that your purpose, your gifting your passion, your personality, put all of that together into a single lump that you and what God has made you for has been attacked, maligned, diminished, suppressed by an active enemy who would love nothing better than to see a whole lot less of God come through in the world. And who knows that God intends himself to come through the world through his creation. Mm-hmm. And so if we take the enemy out of the equation, then passivity is purely our fault. Overfunctioning is purely our fault. Our giftings are, you know, if I'm not using them, it's my own fault. And we completely miss the fact that from the moment of your birth, and in fact, even before you have an enemy who is hell bent on keeping you from becoming who God says you are. And when we miss that, we miss all the places in our life where either through omission or commission, as we've talked about before, the very things that God placed in you to come out into the world, you've learned to mistrust, you've learned to withhold, you've learned to be skeptical of, or you've become so prideful of that, again, you are the power source instead of God. And so when we take the enemy out of the equation, we set ourselves up for any number of traps, the trap of comparison, right? Because really that's primarily the enemy feeding and fueling you lies and accusations that either your gift is superior to others and you should look down on them, or your gift sucks relative to others and you're nothing and you're no one. And if any of that resonates, that means that there's some unexplored spaces, perhaps in gifting, perhaps in passion, perhaps in personality, or maybe just the overarching category of purpose that are really worth digging into with God to see what sort of traps the enemy has specifically placed in there. The statement that I am who Jesus says I am is a lot easier to say and to read in scripture than it is many times to function from. And one of the external things that often happens is that we don't identify the fact that it's spiritual warfare because well-intentioned criticism, and by the way, there is such thing as well-intentioned criticism, and sometimes it's accurate criticism that God wants to use to grow us into better using our giftings, but instead because of whatever we need to dig in our life, we hear that as a reason not to live from our giftings. Or there are people who aren't living from their giftings or whatever it might be, and they're being influenced improperly by their own thoughts or by the enemy's thoughts, and then they pass that along to you. And as you were talking, I was playing this sort of, I'm old enough to have a Rolodex in my mind, not an actual computer, but I was sort of cataloging in my head some moments, as you were saying that, where there were, I think, at least in one occasion, well-intentioned, some cases, I'm not sure how well-intentioned it was, that literally looked at me and said blank about my gifting. You don't have that, you dot dot. And what I think in a lot of those cases are, I was unable to receive that I am who God says I am, not I am what they say I am, or I love the comparison mode because, see, God uses different teachings, that's an easy example. When someone says, that person's a bad teacher, I'm like, says who? Says who? Because there's 30 people over here that they're reaching, and maybe there's 30 people out there, maybe that teacher doesn't fit you, no one's perfect. But then I allowed a lot of those other things, and the other one too that happens a lot is when it comes not from external, is I create it from this, and live and walk in my giftings, and then we've talked about this, it's slightly attached to our conversation, where I begin to assume this is what God's going to do when I live from my giftings, and then it doesn't happen a particular way. I say, I go and I serve someone, and my expectation is, is that in my service of someone and helping them, they're going to completely change their life, and they don't. They're like, thank you, may I have another, or whatever it might be. The enemy gets into my own life then and says, ah, that was a waste, you're really not gifted, or you really shouldn't have done that, and I begin to agree with the lies that he places in us, and that's really subtle in lots of times, at least it is in my life. There's very few times that I can point to it, and immediately I recognize it. Most of the time, it's much more subtle, it's much more through the back door than through the front door, to use that term. Yeah. Here's another trap that just came to mind that wasn't in our notes, the trap of putting metrics and deliverables on our giftings, that if I'm living out of my gifting, then it should be obviously recognizable, quantifiably recognizable. Again, it's another form of diminishment or limiting or comparison, that if it feels like my gifting is only reaching a couple people, but I'm looking at somebody else, and it seems like they're reaching hundreds of people, well, then I must not be living out of my gifting. That's not true. I mean, Jesus talks about the four types of soil and the fourth soil, the good soil where the seed is able to take root and flourish and producing a crop of 30 or 60 or a hundred fold. I don't know if those are options or if that's a progression, maybe both, I don't know, but it sure seems like there's not just a singular objective expectation of return. And so the people that I've seen living out of the truth of their gifting, but growing discouraged and frustrated because it feels like, you know, is any of this making a difference? I feel like maybe this has affected one person. I feel like that's somehow insufficient and inadequate. And if I was truly living out of my gifting, I'd reach the world. I would reach the nation. I would reach, I mean, bring it down to whatever level of magnitude you feel comfortable with reaching for, but that somehow if it's one or two. If we were truly living out of our gifting, more people watch the podcast than, you know, our, our relatives, more people watch it than that. But sometimes I don't feel like it's much more. No, that's exactly right. So this is the second time I've named dropped in this. And another name drop is pastor Randy Haynes used to be on staff here. And he said something one time, you know, there's moments where someone just says things in a way you're like, how have I not received that until then? And there is a truth that comes with a compatible lie. And here it is. Healthy things grow. The lie that comes with it though, is, is that we always assume we're the same type of plant or the tree. And I remember one time he looked at me, he goes, absolutely healthy things grow, but also grows according to what you've been made to be. Are you an oak tree? Are you an azalea bush? Are you a pine tree? Are you a palm tree? You've got to know who you are to understand what healthy growth looks like. So he wasn't denying him such a great thing that healthy things don't grow. They do. The problem is I could easily compare myself to this person who had 30 or 60 and that's God's design for them. And they go, Oh, I'm failing when God's designed for me as maybe a rosebush or who knows what type of whatever might be just looks different. Right. Absolutely. So as we're winding down, there's a couple others that come to mind. And again, the goal is not to create consternation here. The goal is not to become unhelpful by putting the focus on all the different ways we might be falling off. The goal is instead to hold out a helping hand for those that feel like they're stuck and can't figure out why they don't feel like they're living out of their gifting or their purpose or their passion. And so if things are running along smoothly, great. Maybe just store some of these in the back of your mind for later, if and when you get stuck, but for those that are struggling with uncertainty that are struggling with skepticism of, do I even have any giftings, right? These may be helpful places to reflect on. And as always invite God into that space, asking him to show you what your giftings are asking to show you the places where those giftings have been abused and rejected, criticized, condemned, suppressed, or just outright ignored. There's also places where much like with the comparison to others, we just fundamentally limit our understanding of what our gift looks like. We put it in a nice little gift box and insist that it's only this gift. If it comes in or fits in this box. And I tell a couple of stories about this in our square one class. And so I'm not necessarily going to repeat them all here. Um, but one of them for me was I knew I was gifted as a teacher, right? And by the way, that's another trap. Um, it's not prideful to admit what your gifting is, right? That because it didn't come from you in the first place, right? First Corinthians chapter 12 says it comes from the Holy spirit. You didn't earn it. Right. It was given to you. Yeah. Right. So this is just acknowledged. This is confession, right? I'm agreeing with God that this is my gifting, but I had put my gifting in a box and that box looked like it needed to happen in a brick and mortar school in the classroom with desks and chairs and tables and chalkboards or overhead projectors back in the day. And if it wasn't that, then my gifting didn't have a place. And one of the things that God did for me on a beach in Mexico in 2018 was break my box and show me that fundamentally who I am, regardless of where is a teacher. And it was a pivotal moment for me and understanding who he made me to be and understanding my gifting and what it actually means to have that gifting and to have it not be inextricably tied to a particular place that it could only exist in, but to recognize that that gifting that God has placed in me has utility and functionality and life to offer both me and others, any place that I step, that wherever I go, this is the truth of who I am and what I have to offer the world. I think another way that we put it in the box is exacerbated by the local church. And right now you have two people who've talked about teaching a bunch. That's who you usually see up on platform. Those are the, there's a certain set of gifts that you tend to see more publicly. And I think what can be said by the enemy, possibly, hopefully not said by the church, but definitely indicated accidentally is that unless you have these particular gifts, you just notice that where you just have these gifts. Well, the problem with that thinking in all of our lives is that the gift that you just have is the one that the God of the universe thought that was most important for you to have. And in those moments where I diminished some other giftings that might have, what I'm actually doing is that I imply through my actions that, well, God, I should have had a better gift or this wasn't the right gift. And I know there's lots of people that spend a whole lot of time trying to eagerly seek after other gifts instead of stewarding the ones that the God of the universe has already said you have. But again, I think the church can do that. And I want to bring that up. And so if you've been in a church environment, if our church has ever actually communicated to you that unless you have a particular set of gifts that look like teaching or help, so whatever it may be, it's not valued, please accept our forgiveness. That's not our heart. That is not our desire. And that's not the truth about scripture and the truth about God and the truth about you. Yeah. Here's the last one. And again, there's probably more, but these podcasts should only be so long. Some of you were like, could make it shorter anyway, that'd be all right. Is this one, and I think this is one that comes up with time and with age, feeling like any gifts that I have, I should already be aware of and should have already been practicing and should have already been cultivated. And here's one of the cool things that I've seen about God is that there are things that he's placed in you to quote Esther for such a time as this, that weren't meant to be used in your teens or twenties, possibly not even in your thirties or forties, that there are things that he's placed in you for such a time as you find yourself in now. And in some cases it may even be those gifts that were suppressed or repressed or ignored or belittled or whatever. You know, I've seen this with some people with music, for example. You know, every five-year-old is convinced that they can sing and they can. And it's usually as we get older that we're like, well, I can only sing in a particular range, a particular key in the shower, wherever, and the older we get, the more we diminish and minimize our gifts. We pack it into that nice little box. And what I've seen God do time and time again is reveal giftings at particular life stages that we've had no prior experience with. And the invitation is to get to know him there, to get to know ourselves in a new way, and to bring something new into the world that we're not entirely sure how to do, which again, pushes us back to God as source rather than becoming more and more confident and capable in our ability to do things on our own. But it also touches a specific need at a specific time, right where God's placed us. And it's cool to see people discover those things. Yeah. And if you're the type of person that thinks, oh, okay, maybe there's these buried gifting somewhere and now I got to go on a hidden treasure hunt. First off, if God wants to reveal them when God wants to reveal them, you're never going to find them until then. So free yourself of that guilt. But also when we look at first Corinthians chapter 12, and it says the Holy Spirit gives gifts at times of, at the time of conversion, it doesn't say that he limits gifts to only at times of conversion. So there's a good chance sometimes in your life you don't discover them because you didn't even have them until now. God said, okay, now's the time. And now you have it. So whether it's have, and they're buried and they're brought out or whether you didn't have, and it gives a certain time, I'm bringing both of those together to say this, trust God and his timing. And if we walk in that relational aspect where he wants to do things with us, he will reveal in our lives what is important to be revealed in our lives when it's important to have the impact he desires. If we just say yes. Yeah. I feel like we could probably go for another half hour, at least on this, but I think we're going to call this good for now. Well, we turned the cameras off. We'd go have that. That's fair. Um, but if, if you feel like you'd like to extend the conversation, email us at faithforwardatcfcyr.org. We would love to continue that conversation via email in person. This is frankly, one of my favorite things to do with people is to listen to what they've learned about themselves so far, and then help them to discover more of what God has placed inside of them. So please, please take us up on that invitation if that's at all of interest to you. Um, but in the meantime, we're just so encouraged to be part of a group of people that want to passionately pursue the things that God has placed in them to discover who God meant when God meant them to discover what it looks like to be empowered by God, to live this life of power with God. And so thank you for being those kinds of people. And thank you for letting us be a part of your journey. And so we'll see you next time.
