Welcome back to the Faith Forward podcast, as always, John Ackerman, Brian Bales. But not always, right? Just this last week. Yeah, I just thought about that when it came out of your mouth, so there you go. Take two. No, but anyway, so thank you for coming back or coming for the first time, as it may be, as we're kicking off this new year with this wonderfully abrasive series on holy living. I love how you said that, wonderfully abrasive. It is. Because they are not mutually exclusive. No, they're not. And I mean, I think sometimes we forget that that's actually what this life with God is. It's a sifting. It's a refining. It's a rubbing away. It's a being melted down. And I think we're, we're doing some face melting these few weeks as we're talking about this. I know what you're doing there. So long time listeners of the podcast know that, that John attempts immediately in this podcast to give cultural references to make me ADD. And so he was immediately going to Raiders of the Lost Ark when did the face melting as well, I was guessing that was your reference. I mean that, or just, you know, some musical reference. Yeah, something like that. It could be. It was funny as another side segue last week, Lee did to me. Did he? Raindrops falling on my head. And then every step you take, every move you make. Nice. Did it to me twice in the same episode. Exactly. Exactly. Jerk. Anyway. Love you, Lee. So take three and we're still just going to roll. So you're going to get all the outtakes as a bonus feature on this episode. So as, as we're now in this third week on alien living. Right. So the book of first Peter that we've been encouraging you to read day by day and. Very nice. Over multiple weeks so that we really have time to process through this information, to allow it to sink in at a deeper level, because there's some really challenging material here. And so in the first week, we really just hit the high-level call to holy living, that that really is the invitation here. Yes. Not just in this book, but this book highlights it very well. But throughout the overarching narrative of scripture to come into a close, deeply personal, intimate relationship with God. And one of the results of that is going to be. Holy living last week, pastor Lee was talking about. Okay. How do, how do we do that? How do we, how do we, how do we answer the call to holy living? And how do we do that in a single message, a single podcast, a single day, no small feat there. And so today we're going to continue in this theme of how do we answer the call to holy living? And what are some of the things that get in the way? Yeah. So this is going to be a fun episode because as we were talking right beforehand, this has the potential to invite both of us to step up on one of our preferred soap boxes. And so we're going to see how this plays out. We just have one preferred soap box. We have probably have many between us. Yeah. Multiple. Multiple. Um, so Brian, as always, we want people to check out the Sunday message and in this series, probably more so even than some others that's critically important because of the context around this book. Yes. So give people a short snippet of what Sunday's message looked like. And then we're actually going to talk a little bit more about the context that you didn't have time for on Sunday. So again, you know, the call to holy living in first Peter, one of the specific applications of it is outside of the benefits of ourselves, but it's to show others the goodness of God. So it's calling us to live in a particular way. Now, what happens uniquely though, is that there's some things about how God may invite us to live, to make a difference to other people's lives. That is wonderfully abrasive. And, and that's really what first Peter chapter two, verse nine and verse 12, rather two chapter three, verse nine is. And, and what I said on Sunday, I want to repeat here. It is in first Peter, without a doubt, the most misunderstood section of scripture. And this section of scripture has been used by those who don't have a relationship with Christ to malign what God is saying, because they're not understanding the context. Also, there are people who do have a relationship with Christ who either have willfully ignored the context or didn't understand it. And they've used it out of biblical context for their own personal agendas. Both of them are true. Neither one of them, when we live from those place resulting, given God glory. So it's super important when we're talking about three specific relationships that Peter brought up. He brought up three specific relationships that were at the forefront of the Roman culture, the forefront of the culture that the Christian world was embedded in. And it's the relationship that you had with the government and authority, the relationship you had with your owner. If you were a slave in the relationship that happened inside of a marriage, specifically a lot more pointed stuff to the wife, to the husband, but there are some, the husband to the wife, but it seems less abrasive, the husband, the wife. And so when you look at this, we're going to see this, this challenge. And that's why I said on Sunday, we have to understand the context because many times, as I illustrated, just talking about my college friends on Sunday, we can hear the words that are coming out of someone's mouth, but we don't actually understand what is being said because we lack understanding of the particular group of people who are talking. We lack history. In this particular case, we lack cultural understanding. So if we immediately remove the culture of the Roman world and apply it to wherever you're watching Trubner now, most likely from a Western ideal culture, United States being the predominant one, we will misunderstand what's really happening here and we will misapply it. And so when we talk about this, there's three things that, that I really got down and said, okay, when we now say, okay, if this is how it said in Rome, we're not in Rome anymore. It doesn't matter. I said, no, no, no. But there's still some principles behind it because this series is called alien living. What does it mean as to live like aliens and strangers, but not say be alienating and strange, right? If we wind up being alienating and strange because we're living like an alienating, an alien and a stranger, that's one thing, but the goal isn't to be alienating and strange. And so here are the principles. We have been given freedom in Christ. Galatians says, you know, we've been set free for freedom's sake, but for freedom's sake, isn't our personal freedom. There is something greater that he's saying there. And Peter reinforces this idea that our personal freedom is not our highest calling, even though we've been blessed with it. And especially the Christians there were experienced greater freedom than they ever had before. Our highest calling is showing the goodness of God. And anytime those seem to come into tension, showing the goodness of God always wins, always wins. Two, suffering is the call of the alien. It is the call, right? You have been, I have been called to suffer at some level and none of us like that. But again, through our suffering in the way that we are able with the help of the Holy Spirit to persevere through it, it shows the goodness of God. That's exactly what Jesus did. So we're to be like Jesus. And this isn't new. I say this in different ways in lots of sermons, but alien living like is counterintuitive. It's almost always the opposite than what we might think. And if it's not the opposite of what we think, it's most likely because the Holy Spirit has got into us and taught us the true way, but our natural way of thinking, it's almost counterintuitive to our fleshly natural way of thinking. And so that was the landing that we landed on in the midst of that. And so again, John just said it, please take some time to go back and to listen to what was said. There's so many more, many, many things could be talked about in those verses. But I really just want to spend some time on what was the major point of what he was calling us to do, why it does in some ways apply today and why it doesn't. Yeah. So this is clearly a challenging section. This is a challenging series. And like we quasi jokingly referenced just a few moments ago, this should result in some wonderfully abrasive moments with God where some things that we thought we knew may be getting called into question. And that's good. It's actually good to hold our confidence loosely in some areas and allow God to stretch us, to challenge us, to convict us, to give us new ways of thinking, to show us more and more of who he is and how things work in our kingdom. Because like you said, so much of our flesh, it does not understand God. It cannot. And not so much all of our flesh cannot understand God. And so we are constantly in need of new understanding, of deeper understanding. And so this is not a place to hurry past. This is not a place to feel like, I understand all this. I'm good here. I'm going to wait for the next couple of weeks, whatever the new series is. This is a place to allow yourself to be challenged, to allow yourself to be stretched and to invite God into that stretching, to not just double down on your capacity to understand to the best of your ability. So we could obviously fill several podcasts and a number of Sunday mornings just in this book, but there's a few things that we wanted to touch on today. And as always with the Faith Forward podcast, we want it to be practical. Yes. How do I? Yes. And so in this case, how do I allow myself to be challenged? How do I allow myself to be stretched? How do I begin this process of letting God raise to the surface some things that maybe I believe for a long time that he wants to call into question? And so as you were talking through, you know, our personal freedom is not our highest calling, showing the goodness of God is. Suffering is the call of the alien and alien living is often counterintuitive. What do we do when we've been convinced for so long, I know what to do. And now we find ourselves maybe in a place of tension of, I thought I knew, but now I'm not so sure. Well, the answer that we give most often on this is we ask God, right? And, and I will say there's some things that John and I are going to talk about that we've asked God on, right? But the best authority in your life is not through us, but it's through God's word and God's spirit that he will communicate to you. But I think first question that we may ask ourselves is why do we believe what we believe in that way? And one of the main reasons that we believe what we believe is we have engaged a section of scripture without full information. I don't know if you've ever had this belief about someone else and you only knew part of the story you're like, well, that person say, for example, that person is a big jerk when they met me. Okay. That might be true. But what if you then discovered, well, in that day, they had just lost their job. You know, they just discovered they had this horrible health issue. Pick a whole bunch of things, or maybe they all happened at the same time. We would begin to then with that context, then reorient our thinking around that person. And so one of the reasons that so many people look at this section and say, oh, God is saying that we just need to shut up and never say anything to authority. Or God is saying that slavery is okay. Or God is saying that every woman needs to submit to whatever their husband says is because they don't understand what's going on behind. And so I mentioned the podcast a couple of weeks ago that if I had 30 or 45 minutes just to spend on context of Rome and what this meant, things we don't think about. We don't even think about because we're not embedded in them. And by the way, they didn't have to think about them because they were so embedded. It was just natural. Much like some of the things are natural. So John, if I asked you, right, or expected you rather to tell me what went on in your home last night between you and Brooke, you would politely tell me most likely it's none of your business, right? It's none of your business. Part of the reason why is we are built in a culture where what happens inside of your home only matters to you. And at most, as believers, we say matters between us and God, but certainly doesn't matter between Brian or doesn't matter between my local authority. That is not how the Roman culture worked. So understanding the context, the people of that day didn't think about the things that happened in their house the same way. Specifically, there's a group of things called the Roman household codes. And here's what I want you to know without like getting super bored is that the Roman government looked at the household as an example of the state. They looked at every household should be run like the mini state. So that meant they did care about what happened and they took great exception. If you didn't run your household in the way that the state was run. Okay, when we think about the household of the Romans, then we begin to understand why Peter chose these three groups of people. Number one, how the household related to the government mattered. That's why he talked about it. And that's why he chose that. And the household was generally made up of three or four groups of people, husbands, wives, children. They were rarely mentioned, but they were another group and slaves. That's why they were mentioned. So it's not necessarily that Peter saying, I only want to talk about these groups. He specifically speaking about these groups. And what was happening in this context was now these Christians were understanding the freedom that came in Christ and they were not required to live the way Rome said to live. And so they were expressing their freedom, which was great. However, it was creating this tension in people who didn't understand freedom in Christ were using that to slander against them. And this freedom that they were now given in Christ was actually working against this idea of showing others the goodness of God. And there's this rub, this wonderfully abrasive moment. And so when we look at this, right, we need to understand that what is happening, the way the Christians were now acting was everything God said they had in their identity that they could act in that freedom. Now God is coming saying you have the privilege to act this way, but I'm going to call you to not live from that privilege, your earthly freedom in order to communicate to others, the more important, important, eternal freedom. I wish I had a better way in our culture to understand some of these sort of things, but I think we've all had conversations with people that no matter what they're saying, certain things we know about them, we just can't get past to hear certain things that are happening. And because of what was embedded in the Roman culture, people were having a difficulty hearing the truth about God from Christians because of the way their household was being run. And so what God is doing here through Peter is he is asking them to willfully set aside the new freedom that he's given them as a slave, as a woman, as someone who was connecting to the government, but instead willfully put that aside, not because they're not worthy of that freedom, but rather because God was interested in also using this as a moment to reach other people. And so when we talk about freedom, this really, I think, gets under our skin as people from the United States of America. Absolutely. It really, really does because I don't necessarily think that our country was founded on the idea of personal freedom. Everyone could do what they want to do. There was founded on freedom, and we could have that conversation in another place, right? But there has something that I think that's really snuck into the nature of the United States is that you don't tread on me. You don't mess with my personal freedom. And so I think in some ways, especially as we're looking at the biblical context, we have developed what I like to call a freedom problem in the United States. Not that freedom is bad, hear me, but that's why I called this talk proper freedom. Not freedom is wrong, but how to live properly inside of that freedom. And so what's occurred, whether we realize it or not, our own personal freedom has become an idol. And an idol is anything that goes before God. So if God asked you to act this way towards the government, if God asked you to act this way as a slave towards an owner, God asked you to ask this way as someone towards someone you're living with, and you're like, I'm not going to do that. No, well, guess what? Because my freedom says I don't have to. That's become an idol. That shows up a lot. But here's the thing. Freedom, as I said on Sunday, without a purpose is a recipe for narcissism. Or let me just say another way, freedom without a purpose, freedom is the purpose of showing the glory of God. That's why we have it. We'll become, we're the most important person in the world, right? And so we have been set free for a purpose, and that purpose is show the others the goodness of God. And so what is happening is God is asking the people who have now experienced personal freedom on a great new level to set aside the personal freedom, right? That's this side of eternity, to show others the truth about him so they can experience eternal freedom. That is the context. God is not saying slavery is okay. God is not saying that every corrupt ruler needs to be followed and not think about it because there's a difference between personal Christian freedom and personal Christian duty, right? Think about this. Peter was writing, submit to authorities, AD 64. This was Nero. Okay, let's just all get this out. He was nuts. He was evil from an earthly standpoint. But there were still things that he was calling us to do. And I think he's not saying, and I want to make this clear, he is not saying that if you're in a relationship, a woman with a man, that you're supposed to sit there and take a beating. He's not saying that. He's not saying physical abuse is okay, but he is calling us to say, would be willing to set aside things that we're free not to do, but instead do them for the purpose of making a difference. Very specifically in the lives of non-believers. The context of this is understanding what it means to communicate the truth about the goodness of God to people who don't know Jesus. That is really important. And I could totally soapbox this moment, but I'm not, I'm going to pass on this soapbox. You're doing great. Thanks, man. And I think one of the last things that you said is really helpful. I think from a practical, in a practical way that this was specifically helping Christians understand how to relate to non-believers, to people that had not yet come to accept Christ, that this, they'd already received instruction on how to live with other believers. That's been established. And so when we try to conflate things, we try to cherry pick things. When we try to just take a section here and say, oh, well then I don't need to explore any further. I don't need context. I can just take these one or two lines and live my life that way that we're really missing out on one, the life that God has called us to. And we're, we're setting up like, I like the way that you said it. We're setting ourselves up as our own idol, as our own version of God, rather than the God who is. And it doesn't take much. It doesn't take much of just understanding the church in America, right? Let's take the issue of slavery. There were people who looked at this section of scripture in first Peter chapter two and tried to use it as a defense for owning slaves who were Christians. And that was completely and utterly missing the context and not godly and sin because Galatians, which is written in AD 54, 10 years before from the apostle Paul said, there's no such thing in God's economy as that. He doesn't look at people through that lens. And, and so that is really key. It is believers to non-believers that because why, because we have to be living like aliens and strangers sometimes to be an apologetic and saying, I'm going to submit what I didn't have to saying these in doing these sorts of things was definitely getting people's attention and have some things. So practically though, all right, so let's talk about some practical steps because I just alluded to this idea that about freedom, that freedom for a purpose. And what that also means is that when we say freedom, whether we know it or not, every single one of us have an embedded that we've either practically researched through scripture or we just kind of had happened to us an embedded definition of freedom, right? Much like, and I've shared this before, I say clean, I mean, organized, Kathy means sanitized, embedded, didn't know that until she started doing it differently. And so holy living, John, I think it's going to require some freedom from what we're saying here is bad definitions. And let me define bad definitions, any definition that isn't God's definition, right? It doesn't mean it won't seem good, but it's bad because it's not God. So some of those words we kind of pack through here, right? Yeah. And so I think one of the most helpful things, and I heard a friend of mine use this expression in a context, very similar to this, as we were talking through some hot button political topics, you know, present day within the last two years, and he was leading a discussion with a rather mixed group of people. And you could already feel the tension in the room starting to rise as people wanting to retreat to their established corners and begin lobbying things in the opposite direction. And he said, what would it look like if we stayed curious longer? And he just let that sit for a second. And it was a wonderful invitation to, rather than retreat into my corner of certainty and begin lobbying projectiles at the people with whom I disagree, to be curious about why they think what they think, but also to be curious about why I think what I think, to not just stand on, this is what I think, but to hold what I think loosely enough to allow it to be examined. To allow it to be questioned by me and by others. And we're not talking here about making your foundation of faith rocky and unstable and salvation issues and things like that. But, but we are talking about recognizing that this is a very, very large book and not just in number of pages, but in quantity of concepts and quality of thought and belief and life. And if we ever assume that we understand this completely as God intended, I think we're once again, setting ourselves up as the idol. Yeah. Well, I think that, you know, when we say, okay, here's the way to take step of faith forward, you know, holy living will require freedom from bad definitions. Yeah. One of the, I guess, markers for me that I might have a bad definition that immediately upon hearing something I cringe. Yeah. And so one of the things that in first Peter, it says, be subject to another version of scripture say submit. They're basically the same word. I don't like submit to anything. I'm just being honest. My natural reaction. If I feel like someone's trying to get me to be subject or submit in my natural action reaction is rebellion. Right. I will do the opposite. Even if it's not in my best interest, just to prove you wrong. But here's the thing. When God says it, here's what we know. There's nothing God's ever asked us. That's not in our best interest in his glory. He loves us enough. That's the gospel to send us Jesus. He's not out there. If he says, be subject, there must be a good reason. And if I'm cringing. Yeah. It's not because God is wrong. It's because there's something about this definition I've missed. Yeah. So one of the examples of growing up in the environment that grew up, subjection mean willful following to anyone who has over-authored me without ever asking a question. Yeah. That is not the biblical definition of this over and over again. Scripture calls us at chapter 17, ask questions, check it with the Bible. And so I think some of us, you know, need to sort of kind of stop and think about how are we responding to this idea? Submission being one, right? Freedom being another one. And I think, John, what about this idea of suffering? Yes. Suffering. Suffering. Again, I think for some of us, part of our bad definition stems from, and I've encountered this so many times in the last several years, meeting with people, talking with people, hearing their stories, hearing their experiences in church and in life, this deep heart level conviction that they understand theologically and intellectually, this isn't true, but at a heart level, there's this deeply held conviction that if I just follow God every day, every day, if I just follow God, everything should work out. I should be comfortable. I shouldn't actually have to suffer. And you know, when you talk about that, I think we might've talked on podcasts, but I'm pretty sure we've talked about after the podcast from time to time, is that's a uniquely Western thought. It really is. And there's so much about, I think some of the things that we're touching on, and you mentioned it at the beginning, that really is culturally unique to us present day. And that's part of what we need freedom from as well, is we need freedom from the lens of our own culture to see the culture in which this was first spoken and to see the ways in which, because we know that God gave this book to all people for all time, that there must be ways for this to fit into any culture. And so again, the tension of stay curious longer, the tension of, I have bad definitions, where are they? And being curious, right? And inviting God into that space, inviting him to say things that you intellectually or at a heart level might disagree with. And I've had to confront this one on suffering. And thank you for throwing that one specifically at me. Well, yeah, I didn't want to do it with myself. I figured it was easy enough to give it to you, right? But I have had to confront my bad definition around suffering and comfort and God's provision so many times. And every time I think I've got a handle on it, there's a new layer of it that shows up and it all runs somewhere in the vicinity of, but God, I thought that if I did the things that you asked, that this would all work out in whatever preconceived way I had it in my head. And it's just flat out not true. It is not true. And if somebody looked at me and said those words to me, it would take everything in me to not just immediately want to correct them on their theology. And I wouldn't because I try to be kind. But I so often need to be corrected on the theology in my heart. Sure. What my lived experience is trying to tell me is supposed to happen. And it's the same with freedom, right? You were talking about the freedom issue, the freedom problem that we have as 21st century Westerners and Americans. And that's as true corporately. It's as true nationally as it is personally. And so there again, the things that I feel I have the right to not just legally, but personally, the things that I believe I am justified in wanting or thinking or doing. And it's just that that has to be allowed to be questioned. And frankly, you're not going to be able to do some of this on your own. And practically, we can't miss the fact that there is a spiritual battle going on from the enemy in our lives to have wrong definitions of this, because I think that as I'm processing my own life in some areas, we can go from one extreme to the other. I like, okay, I don't have to submit ever to everything is submitted to without thought process, right? I know freedom, for example. Oh, I don't have to do all that. I don't, you know, I don't have to perform. I don't have to do that. That's such a freeing thing. We understand that from God. But if we don't keep it in its lane properly, then we can wind up saying, freedom, I can do what I want. And we use that the other direction, right? And so I think the enemy definitely wants to have us stuck in wrong definitions, right, up here. But as you just said, there's still that challenge, because we almost talked about be transformed by the renewing of your mind. That means it starts with your mind, but still have to make it down here, because I know I am totally with you when there are times where, like, I could verbally correct wrong theology, but if I'm truthful internally at my heart, I'm right with them. Oh, absolutely. I can't make them. You may not have said it that way. I was just thinking through that way. They're like, oh, I know intellectually that isn't true. But what I feel, I've not, I've not, that transformation of my emotions, my transformer of the will from, from my mind hasn't happened yet. Yeah. And so, you know, here, very, very practically, practical step number one, you're going to need help with this. And so some of that help may actually be in the category of academic learning, getting some of the context that you're offering both on Sunday morning and at the beginning of this podcast, right? You can't think differently sometimes until you have new information, right? Until you have a different set of data to look at and allow yourself to wonder, huh, I never knew this before. How does this work? I'm going to confess this right in front of everybody. I know how I grew up. It wasn't until I'm going to say maybe 15 years ago, right? And so I've been a lead pastor for 16, right? When I decided, oh, I feel like God wants me to teach first Peter. I didn't understand the context of this. I mean, I was like, oh, I thought this was here, here, and here. And when I started doing the work, I thought, well, if I'm going to teach it, I, and I'd been through in seminary. I'd been through all that. Maybe I just missed it. Maybe it wasn't taught the same way. We all have to do that work. And so don't, I mean, no one just arrives at it. We got to do the effort. Yeah. But then also, as you were saying, you know, some of this, we're going to need help and we're going to need lots of help and we're going to need different kinds of help. And so some of that help may be context. It may be academic. It may be intellectual, but some of that is also going to have to be help from God. And not just the sort of prayer that we lob up, like, God helped me with this. And then we go on about our day and hope that he's working it in the background somehow, that this is going to have to be intentional. It's going to have to be face to face. And, you know, you were talking about before the verse in Romans about renewing of your mind. And you've taught this before. I've heard you teach on it, that that's not a thing that we do, that the context of that language there is that the renewing of our mind is something that God is doing to our mind with our involvement, that it's not happening against our will. And it's not happening like, you know, an unnoticed process in the background where we suddenly wake up one day matrix style and realize we know Kung Fu and the correct interpretation of the scriptures. This requires active participation. And it's not only the mind, because as Jesus talks about in Matthew, and as Proverbs talks about, as a man thinks in his heart, so is he. And the way that a man speaks, the way that a person speaks comes from the heart. And so there is a retraining of our mind. There's new ways of thinking that are required. And that has to get down to the deeper places in us where life and the lives of the enemy who has spoken so frequently to us in moments of pain and tension and frustration and rejection, he's offered those plausible alternatives that we see illustrated throughout the scriptures. Did God really say, do this on your own? Jesus, you're starving. Turn those stones into bread. Do it by yourself. Elevate yourself. Command the angels to catch you, right? He's so...Satan's basic strategy is lie and deceive in order to steal, kill, and destroy, to set you up as your own God so that you don't bow down and worship the true God, to make yourself the idol of your life. So we're going to need help. You can't get yourself out of this. I'm so glad you brought that out. It's something that sort of let on the cutting room floor of my talk this week. And I forgot to bring it back in our notes. Boy, no. So what you're referring to in the Greek is known as the divine passive, which means the subject is actually doing the work. The object or the direct object has to submit to that work. Over and over again in the New Testament, that's what happens. Whenever a passive is used, and this is geeky, but I want you to know this. He's not making this up. This is actually in this text. If we understand Greek, do the backward, that this is a divine passive. When it's saying to be subject, it's saying we have to submit to the idea of subjection. That's our job, right? And we let him do the work. We are the direct object. He is the one doing the work. He's the noun in that case. And so not trying to make it a grammar lesson, but just in case you thought, John, just like, hey, pick this up out of some other place in scripture that you had to figure out over here to here. It's actually in here too. And again, the original readers would know that because they were reading in that language. It's just something that we miss. Yeah. So practical step number one, you're going to need help. We usually plug this at the end, but we'll do it now as well. Faithforward at cfcyr.org. We would be happy to be part of that help. Yep. We'd be happy to recommend resources that are helpful in the retraining of our brain and in the finding healing for our heart so that this transformation, this ongoing transformation can continue to move along. There's also a second practical step that we wanted to offer. And we're going to come back to this topic of suffering again. Yeah. And so, you know, if we're reorienting ourselves around this idea that these words per se may not be always wrong, it doesn't mean that even though we understand that intellectually, that we don't need some interpretation. Yeah. And I think it goes back a little bit. We're talking about those moments where we know up in our head, but our heart's there. And so, especially around this suffering, if we read this verse, right, and that's exactly, you know, what was said here by Peter, when he said this, he said, um, this idea for this, you've been called to 21, which stopped by suffering because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example so that you might follow in his steps. He's like, okay, you get to suffer. That's an example, following steps to be an example to other people. Again, Christian to non-Christian, right? We're still going to need help through his spirit and through others around us, um, you know, to interpret that well. Yeah. So don't just assume for example, that because we're suffering, that it's necessarily a godly thing, right? Sometimes we suffer because we are not following God and God lets it play out. So suffering by definition, isn't an example of you being an alien and stranger. It may be an example of being alienating and strange. Exactly. But that's why you need interpretation. That's why you got speaking to my life. Why am I suffering here? Is it because that boss of mine was just a big old jerk and they didn't do this for me, or they did this to me or whatever, or was this the natural outcome of my behavior at work? And you want to help me see something through the suffering that ends as a result of that. And so I think that, you know, that is a really big thing because again, we don't want to go too far to the other direction, go from all suffering is bad to all suffering must be God's design to show others his glory. There's that middle asking him part. Yeah. I mean, there's at least four categories, four ways that I can think of that suffering could come. The first is that Satan and his fallen angels are able to oppress and torment people. Yes. The second is that as a result of this fallen world and sinful people and the influence of the enemy that people oppress and torment each other. Yeah. Then there's the, because of things that you are doing, God allows you to feel the consequences of your sin. And then there's the stretching, the refining that God invites as part of your growth. Yes. Do you really feel like you can accurately a hundred percent of the time discern which one of those four is the root cause of your suffering? Yeah. In times of my life, when I'm not in great connection with God, I can very much be an extreme. I can be prideful and assume, well, of course I'm suffering because I'm following God, which may not be true. Right. Or on the other end, I can be, well, of course I'm suffering because I screwed up again. Right. Which isn't true. I've lived on both ends of that and sometimes in the same day. Yeah. Right. But I think people know what that's like. We need that interpretation and that interpretation happens best through the Holy Spirit telling us, but I will say this, God also places people around us to help. That's why community matters. So maybe a real practical step is if you're not in community, you need to be in that because there are things in our life. There's such hot busting issues. We talk about this and in other classes that we lead here is that if we talk about God being the one who communicates to us and we're the telephone that we hear, there's a lot of static on our line around certain issues. And sometimes we just aren't hearing clearly from God on that, which is why it's so important to have other people. I'll give you an example. Pre this podcast, I had a conversation with John that said, there's a lot of things in this conversation that I might want to talk about that are hot button issues. Right. And probably because I got some static on my line on a few of those sort of stuff. And so if you've seen John like move weirdly and kick me under the table, that's what I asked. He hasn't done it yet, but there's still a few moments left. You got time. Yeah. Yeah. And so, I mean, you've touched on it before. One of these other cultural paradigms that we look through in 21st century Western culture is this fierce independence. This was never meant to be engaged with exclusively independently. In fact, it was written first to a church and then to the individuals. And we, in American culture, read it first to the individual and think it might apply to the church. Yeah. So back to point number one, you're going to need help. And that help has to involve your connection with God and the cultivation of that connection so that it becomes more and more clear so that you can understand what his spirit is saying to you, even in those sensitive places where our internal impulse is to shut down or run away or defiantly stand in my corner and go, no, this is what's true. Right. That relationship has to be cultivated. And sometimes because it's so difficult, we need the benefit of the people around us. Yeah. You're not meant to do this alone. So you're going to need some freedom from bad definitions and you're going to need help with that. You're going to be called to suffer, but you're going to need help even discerning the source of that suffering. If this is suffering that you should be moving away from, or if this is suffering that you should be embracing. I have a visual of hugging a porcupine right now, you know, because that's what it feels, but that's the call sometimes. It is. It is. And so you have to be able to ask God the questions, what's true and what's not. It's fundamental, it's basic, it's one-on-one spiritual warfare, conversational relationship with God. God, what's the lie and what's the truth? And then having the capacity to discern the response, to run through the tests that we've so frequently talked about on this platform and other places. Does it line up with the scriptures? Does it line up with the nature of God as revealed in the scriptures? And does it line up with the things that God has specifically said already on topic in that area? Is it producing the fruits of the spirit, right? Is your movement towards or away from certain things eliciting love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, gentleness, faithfulness? I always forget the second to last one in self-control. Goodness, I think so. I listened to that story. All right. And then following that is a combination of, does it seem smarter than you? Because we know God is, but we also know the enemy is. And so what does your godly community say? And I have to qualify this because this is a mini soapbox moment for me. Your godly community is not just people who attend church. Because there's a bunch of people that attend church that have also not cultivated that connection with God. And so when you say, hey, would you pray about this and let me know what you get? Oftentimes what you're going to get is what they think is right. And that's not helpful in most cases. And so I want to just back up because I heard you said, I want to clarify that you're saying just attending church is not enough to make them godly. You're not saying don't pick people who don't attend church because you should be choosing people who understand community at some level. And when I say church is a very broad definition of that. But yeah, that's just because they show up in a community called a church doesn't mean they're there any more than me standing in the garage makes me a car. And that's key because I think a lot of times we naively think about that. Yeah, because I mean, think about this. Think about the people in your life that you could ask them to say, hey, I'm experienced suffering right now and I'm trying to figure out if I'm supposed to move toward this and embrace it, you know, porcupine style or not. And if you're just going to ask people that love you and care about you, sure, they're going to have a really hard time being okay with your suffering and telling you, yes, continue to suffer. This is right. There has to be a cultivation of a connection with God for themselves where they can be able to, they're, they're able to set aside their own personal desires for you, where they want you to be okay. And they want everything to work out and to be able to connect with God on your behalf and go, God, I don't like this, but I feel like you're saying you're, you're doing this right now and that's hard. And that, and so you need all of it. You are not meant to do this in isolation. You're going to need help. Last thing, and you had touched on this at the beginning. Our third practical step. Firstly, it's just a reminder that alien living is in fact counterintuitive, but very, very practically. That means we need to constantly be reminding ourselves. You can't figure this out on your own and you're not supposed to. And that goes against our independence, right? Independence. That fierce independence that says, if you just try hard enough, if you bootstrap your way, you can, you can't, you can't. It's, it's the fundamental truth of the gospel. You cannot do for yourself what only God can do for you. And that's not a one-time thing. That's a lifetime thing. And it brings us back to submission and surrender. This is an ongoing journey and submission and surrender for our flesh, for our 21st century Western mindset is counterintuitive. And so we need to keep that right here. And so when it comes to issues of submitting to authority or questioning authority in whatever level, we have to be able to ask God and we have to be able to ask the people around us who are also asking God and not relying on their own understanding, their own flesh, their own fierce independence. It's, it's not always going to make sense. Yeah. This isn't the most uplifting episode we've done. No, no. But I think it's, again, it's one of those things where we're all attempting to allow the Holy Spirit to work on us. He's kind of touched on some places that are uniquely difficult. Yeah. Wonderfully abrasive as you started at the top of the podcast with, and this is one of those subjects. And what's so interesting is because it's so embedded in our culture, we misunderstand the other culture. And then more importantly, we misunderstand what God's asking. Yeah. And so from, from my heart, if you listen to Sunday, because there's so much I couldn't cover. And there's something that you walked away with that you thought, okay, well, God's asked me to be abused. That's not what's here. Please, please, please, please send me an email. Faith Forward at CFC Wired. I'd love to talk about that. Because even with the time on Sunday and the time here, we're not able to fully get into all the depth of it. But man, uh, if just something here is not resonating and you feel like God is wanting to hurt you, or you feel like God is not doing something that is good. And you can't get past that. We would love to just talk to you because maybe, maybe you aren't hearing from God. Maybe you're hearing from yourself or the enemy, or maybe you are hearing from God and you just need some people to walk with you on that journey. We'd be honored. We would. Yeah. So as always invitation to continue the conversation, any conversation from this episode or past episodes or just wherever you find yourself at the moment. Yeah. But accept that invitation to stay curious longer, to not assume that we're hearing clearly, that we're understanding clearly, but to continue to engage in the process of being transformed and becoming holy. So on behalf of Brian, I'm John. Again, thank you sincerely. I say it often, but it's because I mean it. Thank you for the privilege of being a part of your journey. Amen. And thank you for being a part of ours because we're still very much in process too. So I'll see you next week.
