Welcome back to the Faith Forward Podcast, John Ackerman, Brian Bales, and we're kicking off a new series today. We just recently celebrated Easter, prior to that we were in the series called Complicated talking about Jesus and the church and how the church hasn't always looked like it was supposed to. And then going from that to Easter, right? And the reminder of new life, that there is more, there's more that we have not yet experienced but that we are invited to experience. And so now we're kicking off several weeks, eight weeks actually, that you're calling Heartbeat. So talk a little bit about the overarching view and then what we're going to talk about on Sunday. Sure. So as always, we always invite you, whether you're a member of Christian Fellowship Church in person or online, or whether you just happen to be tuning in from some other place, that this podcast works best, not only, but works best if you've had a moment to engage what we talked about on Sunday. And so that's what I'm going to focus on and we're going to take that faith forward. But also, if you have been someone who have listened to our Sunday talks, whether I'm speaking or you're speaking or anyone else is speaking up there, hopefully from time to time, you might see connection between one series and the next. And so I want to just be really direct about the connection of this series, Heartbeat, to the section that we just talked about in the series called Complicated Jesus, the Church and Us. And one of the reasons that it is so complicated that I didn't get into in that series is that as followers of Jesus Christ, we, for one reason or another, don't live from the heartbeat of God. And I just kind of use that term because we use that in our culture. Heartbeat is like someone's passion, someone's desire. And so I'm using this term that the heartbeat, the passion, the goal, the desire of God is twofold that we launched this week. It's not only twofold, but the basics at it is that, number one, everyone is redeemed. Scripture says that God's desire is that no one should perish, that God loved the world and redemption is available. But then also, are we living from that reality? That's really where we're going to focus a lot on this particular time together in Faith Forward. But the point that we made on Sunday was, number one, that God desires to redeem everyone. That's his heart, that none should perish. And that if you, as you're listening to this, haven't experienced the reality of the redemption of Jesus Christ in your life, that he can save you from your sins and put you back into relationship with God, that you're no longer alienated, you become a friend of God, you become a son or a daughter of God, and he justifies you and he reconciles you. I talked about some of those big words on Sunday, not so we could just throw out big words, but to really understand the positional difference that changes in our life when we accept Jesus as our Savior. Not that we've earned it, but the positional difference that changes. And then what that means, because that's the second part that we're focusing a lot on, is that too often in our life, there are realities that we know, but it doesn't mean we always live from that reality. I mentioned this on Sunday, looking back on two Sundays ago, we had a thing we call proclamation and it's, if you've listened to this podcast, you know, we talked about these rhythms that we're supposed to live with, spent all of last year talking about that, 2022. One of those rhythms, it's the story of God in our life. And so we take time from time to time on a Sunday morning to tell the story of God. We call it proclamation Sunday. You and Brooke shared, if you don't know that, Brooke's his wife, Lee and Carla Towns shared. And also there were people who shared through their baptisms. And this is kind of the point that I was bringing up, I mentioned on Sunday, it was this cutest little girl named Avery. She had to probably maybe 52 pounds and that may be pushing it. Who got baptized is awesome. And I, you know, it was just this great moment. I could just sort of explain what it meant in my life, but she was very hard to see. And so I had her stand up so people could see before baptism. And then once she got baptized, I don't know, I just reached down and I picked her up like in like this. And the truth is my wife came back later to me, I said on Sunday, not just her, but several people also behind her. They looked at that great, awesome moment and their first thought, John was, he's going to throw his back out again. He's going to throw his back out again. And if you know my journey of my back, I've thrown it out twice by doing almost nothing. And my wife is basically has to take care of me. And it's such a reminder that in that moment, in a good way, I wasn't living from my reality of my bad back. I probably should not have done that in that way. Well, in the flip side, what I was trying to say on Sunday is that most of us don't live from the reality of our redemption. But not in a good way, but in a less than good way. And that's really what we focused on that when we are justified, when we were redeemed by God, we accept the salvation of the office of Jesus Christ. I use this term, it's not the perfect term, but this is how God looks at us because of what Jesus done and what we accepted as just as if we have never sinned. It's not that we didn't, but the blood of Jesus Christ covers us. And when we then are justified and he can see us this way, we're no longer enemies and we can be reconciled back to God. And then we built into this idea. What does it mean that we're reconciled back to God, that he sees us as son or daughter and that we are co-heirs with Jesus Christ? That's what it says in scripture. We jumped around a lot, very specifically to build out a broader idea of what we're talking about. And we landed on this truth. It's a truth that God the Father says about how he feels with Jesus in Mark chapter one is baptism. He says from heaven, everyone's there to hear it. The spirit descended like a dove. And then there's Jesus, the third part of the Trinity, just coming out of being baptized by his cousin, John the Baptist. He says, you are my beloved son in whom I am well pleased. There are three things in there. You belong to me, I love you, and you're accepted. You don't have to perform. And if God looks at us because of what Jesus has done and we are reconciled, he looks at us the same way as he sees Jesus because of what Jesus has done for us and forgiven us. That also means that we are his, we belong to him. We are loved and we are accepted. But man, just because that's a reality that's scripturally true, it doesn't mean that we always live from it. And that's really where I spent a lot of my time near the end. That's where we're going to focus a lot, sort of digging in a little bit deeper because John, I have to be truthful, hopefully I'm always truthful in this. That is something in my life that's a whole lot easier to speak theologically from scripture than to live practically. And this podcast and actual spiritual transformation is not about just having information in our head. It's being able to live the truth out of that information. And this is where we're going to push up events today. Yeah. And so this is why if you've managed to hang with us for the first seven minutes of this and you've been around church a while, you decided a long time ago, I'm going to follow Jesus. I promise you there's something here for you today. This isn't just for people for whom this relationship with God is new. This is not just for people for whom this relationship with God is academically unexplored. So if you know a lot of stuff about God and if you've been with God a while, I promise you there's something here because like you were saying, Brian, one of the things that I think we often lose track of is that knowledge is not the same as experience. And I know from looking at your notes for Sunday in preparation for this podcast, that there are still, I know that still there are places in my life where I'm not fully experiencing what it means to be his, to be loved by God and to be accepted because God's been showing me and has continually been showing me over the last decade and change a little bit here and there and another time and another time and another time that there's more. And as you've joked, that's, that may as well be the second name or the third name for this podcast. There's more. Yeah. And so inviting you to hang on because I promise you there's more here. And it is, it is the fundamentals that we're talking about and there's a temptation, I think, especially if you're listening to this podcast and you have had a relationship with Jesus Christ for a long time to ignore the fundament fundamentals. And when we begin to ignore fundamentals, we can develop some really poor habits. We were just talking about off podcast, uh, footwork. You played volleyball. I played basketball. I don't understand footwork and volleyball, but you affirmed this, that your footwork deeply affects your performance and it's pretty fundamental. My, you know, my footwork in basketball deeply affected how I did or didn't things. I'm always reminded of the great coach, John Wooden. He would start out with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who's, you know, wasn't named Kareem Abdul-Jabbar at the time, Lew Alcindor or Bill Walton or some of these, you know, amazing basketball players that went on in every practice in every beginning, he'd start with, this is a basketball. I mean, but for us, some of us may be here. This is basic footwork. This is a basketball. Great. So, you know, how is our footwork right now and how are we living from this? And it really starts with asking some really honest, reflective questions that about what we believe about ourselves at a heart level. You know, um, we say this, you're his, you're love, you're accepted, but I love this, this, uh, this term here. What's your butt? It not B-U-T-T. I said that specifically on purpose, but if you have this temptation, say I've used the term there. Yeah, but let's talk about it. Yeah. So as I was looking at your notes for this Sunday, it, one of the things that you talked about really struck me that, that for many of us, it feels like there's a disqualification, right? I can't be his, I can't be loved and I can't be accepted because of what I've done. Yeah. Right. And so one of the things that we find, we're going to break this down into three categories, not because that's appropriately pastoral, but just because I can't make a three. And if you have a poem afterwards or a really pithy story that also don't rhyme, it's pretty good. Alliteration is very important. We're okay here. Um, but it's important as we've talked about so often on this platform and like you just mentioned as well, there are things that we believe at a heart level that we're not intellectually aware of. There are never things that we would verbalize as somebody who said, Hey, what do you believe about this? We would never necessarily speak these things that we believe deep inside. But one of the things that I'm reminded of is we are all still in the process of becoming who God says we are. And God wants us all to fully experience what it means to be his, what it means to be loved and what it means to be accepted. And so I know for some of us, and I see a little bit of myself in all three of these, that for some of us, we know that God is loving and forgiving. But some things I've done or just fundamentally who I am is actually unforgivable. Yeah, there's that, that fine line. I don't know how you're thinking about, I know when I think through those, I belong to him, I'm love and I'm accepted. That accepted part kind of really comes in that like, I know I belong to him, I'm still his son, I'm all of that, but I'm the one he doesn't talk about. I mentioned this before on this podcast, I don't know how long ago it was, but I think it was Pastor Fred Clark one time asked me a pretty specific question about, okay, do you believe Jesus loves you? Absolutely. Then he said, do you believe Jesus likes you? Right. And what he was trying to delineate that sort of idea is a lot of times we think about love as a command, and it is accepting being a choice. Like yeah, of course God loves me, he sent Jesus to die for me, but if Jesus was down here and I'm not doing perfect things, do I really believe he'd still want to hang out with me and go get some food? Or like everything in my life had to be perfect before he would want to be with me. And that's when I think about what it means to grow from the reality of I've been redeemed. It doesn't mean that he wants me to continue in these things, my poor thinking or my poor actions, my sinful actions, just to be really clear what I meant by poor. But it doesn't mean that all of a sudden, because I have done this, Jesus is like, get away from me. He wants—matter of fact, it's the exact opposite. If you think about over and over in scripture, he invites us in, not so we have acceptance that is something where he doesn't deal with our condition, but we have acceptance so he can deal with our condition. And there's this temptation in my life all the time, all the time, and I've used this before, that I have to be clean before I hop in the shower, that I've got to fix all my stuff before Jesus will accept me. Instead of I go to Jesus, I'm already accepted and he's the fixer of my stuff. And so again, we always try to make this platform practical to not just continue to feed head knowledge but to offer some very, very tactical, you know, ABCs, nuts and bolts of how do I do this? And so it may be helpful. Reflect on this yourself, ask God, which is the third informal name of this podcast, but also ask some people around you that you trust to tell you what they see from the outside. Are there things in your life, past or present, you know, once was or ongoing, where you feel like Jesus probably holds me at arm's length here? Not only am I not worthy, but thank goodness for what he did, but I continue to be not worthy that Jesus embraced lepers, but I bet you he probably wouldn't embrace me. Some of us carry some of that shame, that sense of failure, that sense of inadequacy so deep that at a heart level, we're fairly convinced that we are unapproachable by Jesus. And that can really easily happen, because I think when we say that out loud, we're like, we know that's against the theology. But I was processing a conversation I had with someone, as you were also talking about this, it reminded me of, and it was someone who they would say they did something that was completely wrong. And there were two things that were holding them back about what they felt like, well, God doesn't accept me anymore, or God doesn't love me anymore. Number one is they accidentally took the response of someone else and how they were as humans and said, well, of course, this is how God feels, because there was other people hurt. And these people didn't accept them in the same way. And because that person didn't accept them away or love them the same way, it was really easy to say, God doesn't do that. And if that's you, know that God is God. He already knew all the things that we've done. He knew the things we will do, have done, and, you know, and he still provides redemption for us and reconciliation. The second thing I thought was interesting was that lots of times it can be easy for us in our life to not think that God still accepts us or God still loves us and cares for us, if there's still what I would like to say, ripple effects or consequences of choices that we've made. This side of eternity, we can make poor choices. God can still love us, accept us, and those sort of stuff, and there still be ripple effects. A really direct example is if you got in a vehicle, you were under the influence of something, you wrecked your car, and someone's injured. God can forgive, God can accept, but there's still earthly consequences. A whole list of them can happen from there. And so again, separating this aspect of eternal versus temporary, and I think it gives us definitely this disconnect we can have from God because going back to the first thing is that what I know about God, but what I experienced from other people don't always line up, and so we begin to create a God in the image of us or other people. And I think the need that you're bringing up here is so clear about what it looks like to experience God's mercy and forgiveness because when I really understand it, the amount of mercy I've already received is pretty amazing, but sometimes it's, I don't know, it's harder to frame that out for me because, you know, I turned from my big life of sin when I was a four-year-old than it is for the really big mistake I may have made two weeks ago. Right. Yeah. If we're feeling like Jesus would probably give us the stiff arm for something we have done or are still doing, we are in desperate need of experiencing, experiencing, not intellectually knowing, not theologically understanding, but profoundly experiencing mercy and forgiveness. And so to be very, very practical, ask God. Ask him how he feels about that thing that did happen or is happening. Ask him how he feels about it. You need to hear it from him. Nobody else is going to be able to help you explain it away or diminish it to the point that now this no longer feels like the bowler that's crushing me. You have to hear it from the one who calls you his own and says that he loves you and says that he accepts you and hear him say it to you here. And if I can dig into this maybe a little bit, I don't know if this is where you're going and you can get me back on track if not. When you ask God, there's still that battle going on in that moment that I want to help us understand, especially if we're going back to God. And one of the things that we have shame in our life about is a sin we've committed. And we go back to scripture and we say, it's very clear in scripture, God hates sin. But you need to understand this. That's not saying God hates us. First off, God doesn't see us as sinners. He sees us as sons who might sin or daughters who might sin, but that's not how he sees us. And secondly, the reason that he hates sin is obviously because it's against what he desires. But when we think about it, it's against what he desires. Every time we choose sin, we choose something that's opposite of what's best for us. And God is such a deep loving father. He's going to hate anything that hurts his children. So we hear when we got, what does God think about this? It's easy for us to say, whoa, well, he doesn't approve of that. So he doesn't approve of me or he doesn't love me. No, he doesn't approve of that because he is holy and he wants what's best for us and he knows it's not what's best. And that's a mindset thing. It's not, by the way, if anyone's hearing this and you take a walk away from this and I'm diminishing sin, I'm not at all. I'm diminishing our focus of sin, our focus of sin. He hates it because it's against his holy nature and it hurts his children. He doesn't want anything to hurt the people that he sent Jesus to die for, his children. And so I just, if you ask that God, if you ask God, get my language correct, of this and about your sin and you hear God, I hate that. He's not saying I hate you. I love you. Yeah. And that's something that we, I think really struggle with. I know I really struggle with. It's really hard for me sometimes to separate the offense and the offender. Yeah. And there's another thing that I've found often gets in the way for people in this particular place where the burden, the weight, the sin, the shame just feels so heavy is you may understand, you may even believe at a deep level that God has forgiven you, but you can't forgive yourself. Mm. Yeah, that's so true. You almost feel like, well, it's God, God has to give me a pass, but I know what I deserve and you're hell bent on making sure you get it. And so one of the things that's so hard for me to live from, and I don't think I'm alone, is to understand that Jesus took all the punishment on the cross. When we try to take additional punishment that we understand theologically that he has paid for it. Now I'm not trying to heap shame on this, right? When I say this, but if we logically understand what we're doing is we're saying what he paid wasn't enough. The cross was insufficient. The cross was insufficient. I'm not supposed to stand up and do that, but there is something, I was just recently have a conversation with my youngest and it's an interesting conversation. I felt very specifically by Jesus, I was supposed to not bring blank consequence to blank decision. Yeah. And it was very difficult for my youngest. He's wired like me and somebody who said, no, I don't deserve, I should have blank happen. I should have blank. And it was almost more comfortable for him to have that than to receive grace. And I know there's a lot of people out there like that. And when we don't understand how to receive grace, what it means is we, again, don't understand what it looks like to live from our redemption, to live from it. And it shows up in really interesting ways because in my life, I think in my son's life, maybe in your life as well. When we feel like, oh no, I should be that. We think we're doing a good thing, but actually we're not doing a good thing. Yeah. We're actually refusing to accept the gift that we've been given and are being given on a daily basis to be his, to be loved and accepted and insisting that our way is better, which is pride and idolatry and a host of things that we've talked about before. And you can find those on past episodes, which is really interesting to make a segue to kind of the next part. Which is pride and idolatry and that sort of thing. I don't think we see it that way. We don't. But I think what we're going to talk about next, maybe it's a little bit, and I loved how you wrote this in the notes, and again, on Sunday I referred to, hey, we're going to talk about this in Faith Forward. This is one of the very specific parts I didn't have a chance to get into at the depth that I wanted to on Sunday just due to time that we do now, is this approach that I pretty much got it. Maybe we're not going to say we're perfect, but maybe above average, pretty good, however one might be. I just need God every once in a while to take care of the trouble spots. I just got back like right before we did this podcast from the dentist. It'd be like, all right, I can handle all my teeth. I just need to go to the dentist for this little part, recognize I'm insufficient to do my own dental work, but I can do all this other stuff. That's not how it works with God. And this is probably as common a trap for people to fall into as the first. The first trap of shame and inability to receive forgiveness and acceptance is what I've seen keep a lot of people from a relationship with Jesus. This is the one that I've seen a lot of people in church struggle with, that I got here on my own merits. I've been pretty good most of my life, and it reminds me of the story in the gospels in multiple places of the rich young ruler that comes to Jesus and calls him good teacher. What must I do to inherit salvation or eternal life? And Jesus's first comment is, what do you mean by good? Why do you call me good? And it's so fundamentally identifies the way that this person was approaching the entire issue of salvation and the eternal life is on your merits. And so Jesus does this really interesting thing. I love so many things about him, but one of the things is the way he goes about asking questions rather than giving answers. And anyone who knows John Ackerman, he loves to answer your question with a question. What do you mean? Yeah, exactly. And it has nothing to do with his hair and his beard and how he may look according to a historical European version of somebody. There's sandals on today too, I'm going in for extra credit. He allows this person to read out their resume, right? Well, here's the commandments, have you done that? And the guy has the audacity without recognizing it's audacious to say, I've done that since I was a kid. It's an incredible statement. And depending on which gospel you read this in, at least one of them says that Jesus looked on him with compassion or Jesus loved him after that response. And it has to be a little bit like, I love him, he doesn't see it, but I love his heart. I love where he's trying to go. But it's a little bit like saying, God, I've got like 90% of my life handled. And I just need you to clean up the other 10%. What do we need to do for that? And looking at them and going, oh, you know what we need to do? We actually need to talk about math. That's the most loving thing that we could do, right? We need to talk about math because your stats are off. And so there's something there for us to look at and recognize that maybe one of the things that's keeping me from feel like I'm his, that I'm loved and that I'm accepted, is my math. It's funny, I think there's a lot of people right now who are thinking to themselves, I spent all this time in high school thinking I wasn't going to have to do math again, just for the record. But this is a different sort of math. But going back to the math analogy, just for a moment, I think this plays out. There are times when we were younger, we were unaware of our bad math process until we met the person who knew how to put the process right. And that's the rich young ruler. What I love about also about the rich young ruler is he didn't know it, but he was doing the right thing. He was asking God, right? He was doing the right thing, his purpose. So, you know, the author of spiritual math, the author of real math, you know, God in the flesh, revealed something in him, right? When he says, okay, if you've done all of this, all right, let me reveal something. Let me give you an experience to just go give everything that you have to take care of the poor, which by the way, wasn't an absurdity, especially when we understand the Hebrew, the Jewish approach to things was often to speak in hyperbole. So for example, one of the times Jesus said, if you're going to follow him, anyone who follows after me must hate his mother and his father. Jesus wasn't saying you literally have to hate them. What he was saying is comparatively, this is what it looks like. I'm not sure even in this section of the rich young ruler that Jesus was actually saying, you got to go and give away everything you have to the penny. What he is saying is though, all right, let's test this. Let's let's play this out. Let's test your math. You don't covet, right? That's one of the 10. Right. Exactly. Exactly. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. That's you know, that's another one. That's at the first, right? What did he just do in giving this? Because this really, again, giving away everything was the application. It wasn't the principle. It was the application that he was pulling out to this person about this idea of aha. Here's where I think it attaches back to what we're talking about on Sunday, is that if I truly believe positionally, I've been redeemed and I'm living from that redemption, that I belong to the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, I belong to Jesus. I belong to God, the father, I belong to the Holy Spirit. If he says to me, go give everything away. And it's not even just like hyperbole. It's everything. And I know it's him. Well, if I'm living from my redemption, I can. Why? Not because it's easy, not because there won't be some difficulties. But I understand that I belong to him. I'm loved and I'm accepted and there's no safer place to be. And so in those moments, you know, I think one of the maybe helpful suggestions I would think about is if Jesus was standing in front of you, and by the way, if you have a relationship with Jesus Christ, his spirit is in you, so just, you know, as a reminder, so it's not a farfetched thing, what I'm saying, if Jesus didn't stand in front of me and it was very clear, he said, do blank. And I say, nope, gonna pass. And I continue to say that. So because I think, John, there's been more than a few things in my life I've initially started with, nope, I'm going to pass. And there's probably some things right now I'm passing on that Jesus is working on me. The truth is I'm not living from the reality of my position, if it's his, of what it means to be redeemed, because I don't believe in that moment that he's enough. I don't believe in that moment that he loves me at the level that he does. If blank is going to happen, I can't do blank. And that was the beauty of the rich young ruler, what he was pulling out. He was like, look, actually, you do have a God before me. Actually, you do covet something differently. I hit the first part of the Ten Commandments and the second part, right? I've hit the principle and the application. And that's what Jesus is about. And we were going to have those moments, I think, where if we go and we ask him, he is going to say something that we didn't see coming, because if we really go with a heart of knowing, he knows, really good. And I always wonder about the rich young ruler, you know, when we get to heaven, I'm not sure what I'll care about knowing then. I like to think there's some things I'm going to care about that I probably won't. But I'd like to know, you know, was this guy coming solely for just affirmation from a good teacher to tell you, you got it all together? Was there, you know, part of that, but part of like, OK, well, I think I got it all together. And maybe he was recognizing something was off. So there's a whole lot of people that engage Jesus that kind of they were curious, but they didn't want to show their full hand. I don't know. But I do know this. Jesus knew his heart and Jesus knew where to go. And so Jesus knows our heart and he knows where to go in those places. So if we want to live from the reality of our redemption, one of the questions that we may be willing to ask God is, God, where are some areas I'm not living from that? Yeah. And it's why we put these two examples right next to each other. The first one, what some people struggle with and feeling like we're his, like we're loved and we're accepted, is the oppressive sense of shame, of failure, of inadequacy. We are so painfully aware of what we've done or what we've not done, of how we've screwed it up and how we've fallen short that it just feels like, man, there's a barrier. There's a barrier that even God could not cross. And with the second one, there's a failure to recognize our insufficiency, our inadequacy, our failure, our limitations. Right. And so back to your point of if you hear, if you heard the first part and heard us trivialize sin, we're not, because honestly, what some of us need to be confronted with, just like the rich young ruler, is we don't have it nearly as together as we think we do. That, that the math's wrong. That it's not that we've got 90 percent well in hand and we just need Jesus for the last 10. Nor is it fair to even just flip it, that we need Jesus for 90 and we've got 10. We've got zero and we need him for a hundred percent. And if we don't have an internal sense of that and one that then does not drive us to shame and separation that way, because here's the thing, the enemy doesn't care which way you fall off. All he cares about is that you do live disconnected, that you do live as an orphan rather than from the position as a son, that you do live from a position of being fundamentally unlovable or unloved or fundamentally unaccepted. That's what he cares about. And so he's happy when we engage in this pendulum swing of I am worthless. I am just a piece of doo doo. No, everything's fine. And I'm a good person. No. And that is, again, why we so desperately need to hear from, just like Jesus heard from his father, this is who you are. Our soul craves that very same message being spoken to us, not only from the pages of scripture, but from God himself. Absolutely. And so as you sort of make our way to the third one, you know, without the poem or the story, here's what I actually didn't tell John. So John is part of a team that actually he leads it, not just part of our spiritual life team, where we look at all kinds of things that happen in development. One thing that comes through that team here at Christian Fellowship Church is actually the approach to what we're going to talk about on Sunday. Sometimes I usually lead that part with the team, but John leads the whole team. I get deeper into how I'm going to go to certain places. I didn't tell you much about this third one because actually we're going to we're going to tease it because we're going to come back a lot to this because there's a place in this series called Heartbeat where we're going to talk a lot about the struggle that a lot of us have that the older brother has in the story of the prodigal son. And how I just say it is this way is that I accept the fact that my redemption was grace. It's by grace we are saved. There's nothing I could do to earn it. But then after we accept that redemption, almost if you think of like a line, if you start on the left and there's a cross in the middle and you go to the right to the left is before you accept Jesus Christ as your savior. OK, boom, we hit the cross. We we confess our sins. He's faithful just to forgive us our sins. So he justifies us and restores us. And now we're redeemed and we have the position of son. There's so many of us that now spend this time post cross trying to. Justify our justification. Yeah. All right, you did this for me, I couldn't earn it. So now the rest of my life, I have to prove that you didn't waste it, Jesus. The rest of my life, I had to prove that I'm not this. And that really is in many ways the outflow of the older brother and the prodigal son. So you have it down. I mean, to jump ahead of you, but that's good for those who don't know the story. Right, right. And you actually see, you know, it's it's a fairly common story to hear if you've been around church for a little while. But I see a little bit of the younger brother in the previous section. I'm pretty good. I just need God for a little bit. That younger son is fairly convinced he doesn't need his father. He just needs his father's money. Yep. And so if you'll just give me the 10 percent that I lack, the rest of my life is golden. Jesus, I really just need you for my ticket to heaven. And you would never say it, but you live like it. But in this third category, if I'm a child of God, but my butt is, I have to earn my keep. Right. That's the older brother. The older brother never leaves. Right. He is obedient to the nth degree, but he completely misses the heart of God. He completely misses the heart of his father. And there's just that was a great analogy that you used of and it brings to mind a movie analogy for me, Little Orphan Annie. Mm hmm. Right. Grows up as an orphan. Yeah. Unloved, unaccepted. Right. Belonging to no one. And then there's this day comes where she gets adopted and she becomes someone's daughter and she now has a father and she's taken to his house, Daddy Warbucks. And it's like you see the kingdom for a second. She's brought into this beautiful place and they ask her, what do you want to do first? And so even though her entire life has been fundamentally altered and everything around her circumstantially has changed, the heart hasn't caught up yet. Yeah. Because the response that comes out of her mouth is, well, I guess I'll start with the windows because then if I drip, then I can mop up the floor later rather than doing it. Right. She's still thinking like an orphan. She's not thinking like a daughter. She's still feeling like, well, they've brought me to a nicer place than I was before. My life is significantly improved, but I still have to earn it. Yeah. And I think it's possible inside of our, after we accepted Jesus Christ in our life to sometimes be the younger brother and then sometimes be the older brother, depending what day. But I would say for me, and this is just for me personally, it's a little insight to me. Much more of my life has been, I think, reflective of a older brother mentally than a younger brother mentally, because I spent a whole lot of my life, not consciously, actually, because I wouldn't say it, but the way I live, like if I mess up, like if I do what the younger brother does, I'm hosed. Right. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to do all the right things. However, what we need to examine our faith in this, why am I doing the right things? Am I doing the right things out of the fact that I have been redeemed and I'm loved and I am accepted? And that's my just natural response to that. Or am I doing it because I feel like if I don't do it, I will no longer be loved. I will no longer be accepted. And that really is the difficulty that the older brother is dealing with. When the younger brother comes back and the father who represents God, our father, still loves and still accepts the younger brother after he did, he basically told the father by saying, I want your inheritance. I wish you were dead. That's the equivalent for us. It blows up his whole worldview because his whole worldview says, if I do all of that, I'm going to be rejected and accepted. And his dad tells him, look, all of this has been yours all the time. And so for me, I've spent a significant amount of my time not living my life. I've lived my life as the older brother, not living for the reality of my redemption. And there's so much that God has had for me that I've not walked in because I've been much more afraid to mess up than I have been to walk in that. And I know that sounds weird to say, but I bet there's a whole lot of people out there like that, too. Yeah, yeah. And so the invitation is always spend a little time reflecting on this, invite God into that reflection. And as it's helpful, invite some of the people that know you best to speak into some of these categories. And again, I resonate with all of them. I spent most of my teenage years feeling like I'm in the I'm pretty good category and maybe I just need God for the last 10%. But honestly, sometimes I wasn't even convinced of that. And then there was that stretch where, as I really started to come to terms with my brokenness, my woundedness, the depth of my sinfulness, there was a stretch where I don't know that some of this is truly forgivable. And I don't know that I could ever truly forgive myself. And then there's been a whole lot of, all right, I'm in, I'm his kid. I know he loves me. He's told me he loves me any number of times. But is that other shoe going to drop if I don't stay in line? And is that something, is that a boundary I want to test? That, again, these are things that intellectually and theologically might never pass our lips. And yet we're still living less than the life that Jesus died for and less than the life that God is offering. And so friends, I promise you, however many years you've been on this journey, however much you've learned and studied and read and memorized, there's more for you to experience in what it truly means to be his. There's more for you to experience with his love and there's more, there's so much more to experience in what it means to be accepted. And so we would just invite you as we are continuing to do ourselves to stay on this journey. And as we go through these next eight weeks that may feel like Christian fundamentals, it's not because there's more. And so we hope that you'll join us. Yeah. And again, we're near the end. One more diagnostic thing I get to say, and this is coming out of where I am, not where I've been. If when you begin to diagnose whether or not, you know, just asking God, I'm living from the reality of my redemption. If you find yourself much more comfortable with receiving difficults in life than being blessed, like if I mess up, of course, I'm going to get negative things from God, but I have to perform all the time, all the time, all the time to get something good and blessing with God. There's some things that God wants to work on. I know that's true in my life. And if you'd like to talk to me about that, I'm happy to talk to you about it. If you would like to talk to John about that, he's happy to talk about it. And the best way to get ahold of us is just send us an email, faithforwardatcfcyr.org. We should probably just for the record also have askgodatcfcyr.org and there's more at, yeah, we're going to have at least two subtitles to the main point. It's going to take us a couple of minutes to get through the opener from here on out, but we'll get there. So with all that said, thank you, truly. Thank you for the, for the invitation that you give us every time you access these podcasts. Thank you for giving us the space to talk about these things that have been so instrumental in us becoming more of who God says we are. Thank you for inviting us to be a little bit of a part of your journey and thanks for continuing to be part of ours. So until next time, thank you.
