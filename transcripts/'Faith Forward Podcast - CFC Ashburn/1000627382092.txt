Welcome back to the Faith Forward Podcast. I always like the positivity of the assumption that they are coming back or to some, welcome to the first. I feel like I'm at least half welcoming us back. That is true. We've been talking about this off podcast that this is our third season of Just Us, our fourth season. I think season one is kind of like the lost episodes. It is, yeah. I'm not even sure we could find those anywhere. Hopefully they'd be worthy of finding, but there's a debate sometimes about what's worthy and what's not. But this is sort of season three of how we've been approaching the Faith Forward Podcast. And if you've stumbled across this, this is exactly what this is, a Faith Forward Podcast. It's a podcast, you know, based out of Christian Fellowship Church in Ashburn, Virginia, where we take the talk that whoever gave on Sunday around scripture, lots of times it's me, sometimes it's other people, and we say, okay, what do we do with this beyond just this is something that we've heard? How do we take our faith forward and apply it to Monday through Saturday? Because if you've ever been as part of any church gathering, you understand that three things seem to happen when you open up scripture. Number one, what are you going to say? Number two, where did you get it? You got to show it from scripture. Number three, you got to say why it matters. And then the why it matters part, particularly to us, sometimes it takes a little bit longer. I have no idea if my counting was right in that, but you know, it is our first time back. But then right about the time you get to the, all right, here's how we do it. Practical step number one, people are looking at their watches like, dude, it's time to go. Yeah. And all scripture is practical. All scripture is valuable for teaching. But we have to understand since scripture is the authority of our life, when we teach on Sunday, we have to go to the authority first. This is where it comes from. And so that by nature of our attention spans, by nature of the quality of the individual speaking, in that case, me, you know, there's only so long. And so lots of times we don't get as deep into that. And that's what this is designed for specifically. Not that Sundays aren't practical, but even more practical to get this and move our faith forward. Yeah. And also we found helps to humanize this life with Jesus a little bit, because again, all the things that we try to do on a Sunday, one of the things that we sometimes don't have time for is the story in depth. We do a great job of weaving in illustrative stories and examples of how these things apply, but we sometimes don't have time for, all right, let me tell you the five or the 10 minute story. And it's one of the things that we're able to make space for here. What is this life with Jesus really look like with skin on? Yeah. And so it's good to be back. So like you said, whether you're joining us for the first time, you just found CFC, you just found the podcast. Welcome. This is our 80th episode in this current iteration. There you go. We're nearing the century mark. We'll probably hit that this season, but welcome if this is the first. And if you've been with us for a long time, thank you. We do have a body of loyal listeners and we very much appreciate you. That's right. We'll plug it up front. We love to hear from you as well. We're happy to sit here and tell our stories, but we do this in part because we care a lot about being on a journey with others, with other likehearted people. And so hearing from you, questions that you have, things you'd like to hear more about, please send it to us, faithforwardatcfcyard.org or just going over to Brian's house and knock on the door. Hey, that works. But the typical flow of this is we recap the Sunday message for a couple minutes. This is not meant to serve as a replacement for the Sunday message. This isn't the cheat code. So you don't have to show up on Sunday. We still want you to hear all the things that you mentioned that we first need to do as far as going back and addressing where we find this in the scripture, going back to the source of authority, explaining what it is and why it matters, and then get to the how. Because if you just skip to the how, you've lost some context that matters. Yeah. And the context matters without a doubt because we live in a society where there's all kinds of people, well-intentioned and not well-intentioned, all kinds of organizations, well-intentioned and not well-intentioned that want to tell you how to live your life. But the truth is we understand from scripture that the only one truly qualified to do that is the one who created us, and that is God the Father, Jesus his Son, the Holy Spirit who dwells in us if we're believers. And so the perfect revelation of what he has to say is in the Bible. We know that. Now, sometimes we translate it wrong. There's some issues on our end, but we want to go to that. And so we actually started this new series that we're kicking off this new season of the podcast with, and it's called Retuning. Now the idea of this, when I put together a series with a team that you're on and others is anyone who's ever been involved with any sort of music understands when there is especially several musicians coming together before it's a gig, it's a band concert, it's a marching band. Pickle, I'm a band parent, so there's a lot of band stuff there. There's this moment before that that could literally sound like the wailing of a pregnant water buffalo. It doesn't sound that great, to be honest, because all of these instruments are like . But what that is, is they are tuning their instruments. I use the term retuning because almost every single one of those instruments had been in tune. But when you retune something, you're setting the proper intervals so that on a particular instrument, if that instrument is played properly, it will make a consistent sound. So when all the notes are playing, it happens and it goes well and it sounds good. Now in life, we make this analogy. There are times where we have to sort of retune our lives back to what Scripture says, back to what the Spirit says, back to the vision God's placed in us, just like when you're a musician. And there are lots of reasons as a musician that your instrument gets out of tune. And there are lots of reasons we as individuals, where we get out of tune and we're not walking with God in that way. And so we started this particular series, though, by saying, what are we trying to tune ourselves towards? And we have a vision here at the church that I would like to say isn't necessarily unique. Maybe it's unique in how we express it, but if you back it up, it's right there in Scripture. And that is, is that to be indispensable to the community God called us to. And that idea of indispensable nature actually is rooted in where we started in Scripture, Matthew chapter five, verse 13 through 16. And so that's where we kicked off. And so as we kick this off today and talking about this idea of retuning, one of the things that I'm reminded of is that you've gotten to experience this retuning process with one of your kids in high school band. And anybody who's been around- And in middle school band, which after today is a whole different level of retuning in middle school band than high school. It is. And sometimes I think we lose sight of the fact that professional musicians also retune. You go to world-renowned orchestras and the same pregnant water buffalo sound ensues at the beginning. And that's a great point. And so we need this. However long you have been walking with God, however long you have known God, however long you have professed belief in Jesus, however long you have attended church, however long you were forcibly dragged into church, we all need to go through a constant process of retuning. It's not a one and done. It's not a once when you were young and you're good for the rest of your life. Like musicians, if you use the instrument a lot, it needs to be constantly tuned. If you don't use the instrument a lot, it needs to be constantly tuned. There's no escape from this. And so it is with us. There is a need to be constantly retuned. And so this retuning is sort of establishing a baseline. The concept of retuning is establishing a baseline, a foundation that we can then build on. And we realized as we're coming back to the podcast, and again, a lot of people have just found us that don't necessarily attend CFC, but we've also had a lot of people that just found CFC over the last few months and may not have known we have a podcast. So we've thought this might be a helpful time to reestablish the baseline for the podcast, which is also inherently the baseline for who we are as a church as well. But there's some fundamental assumptions that we have on this podcast and there are things that you're going to hear us say a lot over the episodes to come and over all the episodes back in the archives if you go backwards. But one of the fundamental assumptions that you'll hear us use a lot is this premise of ask God. Yeah. I don't know if it's a joke anymore, but saying was like, if there was a second title for this podcast, it would be called Ask God instead of Faith Forward. And it's not because we're trying to cop out and say, oh, I don't know, ask God. We understand that the best person to give us some answers is God, right? And there's some times where I've come up with answers like, oh, that matches God, but I better make sure that that matches God that comes in. And so that's a premise. That's a basic assumption in this that we talk from. And if you don't know what that's like, if you don't know how to ask God in your life, because behind the premise of ask God is this biblical premise that if we have a relationship with Jesus Christ, we have God in us, the very spirit of him, the Holy Spirit in us who is designed to do many things, not the least of which is to communicate, to help us to grow in righteousness. In some cases, to convict us of our unrighteousness. I know those are big words of basis, help us to be more like Jesus and in ways that are positive and to keep us from doing things we're not supposed to do in ways that are negative that we do it. And so that's a premise. So and I think that matters that we talk about, because one of the things about this particular talk today is that if we approach every scenario the same, we might be a little bit like the blind squirrel that gets the nut every once in a while. But there's a lot of times there creates a problem because we forget to go to God and ask him how this is supposed to happen, because we look at the scenario, the situation, and it seems the same to us, but there's nuances and things, even if they are the same, that the Holy Spirit wants us to apply maybe differently in that case. So fundamental assumption number one, we can ask God and we should ask God. And inherent in that is there's no point in asking God if God doesn't respond. And there's no point in asking God if God doesn't respond in ways that we can understand. And so inherent in this assumption that we should be asking God on a regular basis is that God is still in the business of communicating to his kids. As we look throughout the breadth of scripture, we see that that's the type of God that God is, that he is a communicative God. He's a God of mystery. He is a God that refuses to be boxed into, I only work this way and I only do these things. But he is wonderfully creative and wonderfully personal. As we look at the way that he is with the people throughout scripture, we see a God who wants to be known, who makes himself known, and who walks with people and informs not only what they do and where they should go, but who they are. And so inherent in this idea of asking God is one, we can, two, he'll respond, three, he'll respond in a way that we can understand and not just the perfectly timed license plate of the car in front of me as I'm driving into work. But the book of James has this great line, Elijah was a man just like us. And so you like, well, okay. So I go back and look at the life of Elijah and it's tempting to just look at the things Elijah did. Yeah. But the way that Elijah did all these amazing things was he talked to God and God talked to him and God said, do these things. And so Elijah is a man just like us. Elijah has a relationship with God, just like the relationship that we can have. And so that's core to everything else we're going to talk about, that that's the relationship with God that we're after. And not just to go do amazing things like Elijah did, but to walk with God the way Elijah did. Yeah. And those assumptions that, well, we don't have necessarily the time to dig in. And if you want to go back to the old podcast, I'm sure you can find it. We flesh that out in scripture all the time about where that comes from. It really, really matters because one of the things that I brought up particularly this week, when we look at this section of Matthew chapter five, verse 13 and 16 is many times as believers, we have a wrong assumption of our identity. One thing that Jesus says in the Sermon on the Mount, and we just 13 to 16, he says, you are salt. You are light. You are the salt of the world. You are the light of the world. Now when we understand the idea of what salt and light was in the ancient world, a lot like today, definitely with light, maybe you are duct tape and light. It may be a way to say it today is that they were indispensable elements for their culture. You could not function while in that culture without light. Still can't in this culture. You could not function without salt. It just did so many things that we just take for granted now. And when Jesus said we are salt and light, one of the wrong assumptions that we have is saying, well, I can actually choose to be salt or light and no, actually we can't. If we're a believer, our identity is salt and light. The question that we're getting around when Jesus makes us is that are we being good salt or bad salt? Are we being effective light or ineffective light? Because he presents both with the salt and the light, a moment where salt does good things and then a moment where it's worthless and this valuable thing that actually we get our word salary from in the Latin. That's how valuable it was, was basically only good to be thrown on the ground and walked on or this light that people covered up and it didn't cause warmth. It didn't bring warmth. It didn't bring direction like it's designed. And so one of the fundamental assumptions we were trying to get at on Sunday is what do we think about us as salt and light? If we think I can choose to be salt or choose to be light, that's a wrong assumption. Jesus says we are. The struggle is whether we're good salt, whether we're good light. And we also have to understand that Jesus' statement here is he has designed those of us who are believers, those who come together in an imperfect thing called the church to be the element of effective change and impact in the world and the culture he's put us in. And we have to start there. It's why we in many ways we do this podcast. Certainly we do this podcast because we want people to know how to take their faith forward. But what is the purpose of taking your faith forward? Is it just for us so that we're better people? Sure we want to be better people. But part of the reason that God wants us to be better people is to be salt and light to the world. We got to go a little bit farther in this way. And so getting at this proper idea, going back to asking God where we're going to talk a little bit about the tensions is it's not just what we are, but how we do and live out what we are. And that is the ask God part that we got to go back to. Yeah. And much like the retuning, it never stops. No. Mm hmm. And I really liked how you recapped, you know, part of what you talked about on Sunday with we are salt. It's not a question of if we are, but it's a question of how do we be salt and are we effective salt? How do we be light and are we effective light? And so another fundamental assumption that we have here on this podcast and in our church culture in general is, and the third potential name of this podcast is there's more. Yeah. There's more. There's always more in this life with God. Jesus says in John 10 10, I've come that you might have life and have it abundantly have it to the full. And I think so often we lose sight of the fact that if, as you close just about every service from Ephesians, that, that we serve a God who is able to do a measurably more than all we could ask or imagine that undergirding all of this is the reality, the promise, the guarantee there is more than we have experienced up till this point. There is more than we have understood up to this point. There is more to learn. There is more to see. There is more to do. There is more to discover. There's more to uncover. And it's a really great place to be if you're comfortable with that discomfort, but it's a really uncomfortable place to be. If going back to the salt and light, I know how to be salt this way. Can't I just continue to be salt this way? I know how to be light at this particular setting on the dimmer switch. Can't I just keep being that light and not have to discover more or go through the discomfort of learning how to be salt differently or light differently? And so inherent in everything we ever talk about, not just in this episode, but in pretty much all of them is there's more. God is constantly inviting us into more and not like it's the endless homework assignment, not like it's you have to, but you get to discover more of who God is and more of who he made you to be. And just like we said in the first part, this is less about what we do because God doesn't need us to do anything. No. He makes that clear in Acts. God doesn't need you to do things, but he wants to do things with you. And so there is more to discover about this life with him than we've yet experienced simply because we have a limitless God who operates in eternity. Yep. And I think one of the challenges, tensions, or maybe even just potholes we can hit that keep our faith moving forward is a problem. I heard someone say this recently, so it's not unique with me is the formation by information problem. Yeah. Now I want to back up. I didn't have time to get us on Sunday. What I thought was really interesting is I was studying Matthew five, chapter 13 to 16. You know, there are lots of people out there who've written what's known as commentaries and they give you exegesis and they've got all things about happened and they start commenting that sort of thing. What I found very unique about this is that Jesus says you are salt, but he doesn't particularly talk about what aspect of salt are you preserving? Are you an irritant? Are you, you know, cause they both worked through it, right? If you've ever had a wound, it can purify a wound. It will hurt. Anyone who's ever gotten the ocean with an open gut, it will hurt. And that's part of the use. Jesus never really does that. He doesn't explain it. I believe the reason he doesn't is because his part, his point wasn't not what aspect is that as much as that you can't live without it. It does so much. But when I was reading the commentators, I discovered a trend and I don't know if it was because their personality or whatever, almost every commentator wanted to focus on a different aspect of what it does. And that was their focus of application. That was their focus. And I wondered in some ways in those cases, if that isn't the application problem from information they already had that formation by information. So now with that said, let me back that up. We have a tendency to get information and we think it's that information that tells us specifically what to do. I will say that oftentimes information tells us a lot more what not to do than to do. The Bible is very clear about you shall not murder and there you go, right? Don't do that. You don't do this. You don't do this. None of this. But when it says to love your neighbor as yourself, how does that happen, right? If I just have the information, what I'm going to do by natural tendency is I'm going to figure out in my mind, what information do I have when I did something in the past a very particular way that was effective and I'm going to attempt to repeat it. That is well-intentioned most of the time. Sometimes it's lazy, but most of the time I think it's well-intentioned and it's good. What it does is it assumes that the information itself is what transforms us and scripture is very clear that information is not transforming. Information is just information. The transforming aspect comes to the Holy Spirit and there's always this sort of foil in scripture of people we can go back to. If you've ever heard of a group known as the Pharisees or the scribes and the Sadducees in the early New Testament, they were the people who often come up being most against Jesus. But here's what they didn't lack, information. Every single Sadducee, every single Pharisee could quote you the first five books of the Old Testament verbatim. I will hold that up against 99.9999% of actual believers today and say they had more memorized information, but what they weren't was transformed. They were standing, looking at God in the flesh and all this information and it hadn't changed them. It's that reminder that information itself doesn't change us, but there's that interaction with what the Holy Spirit does with that information. That is the transformative process. When we talk about this idea of being salt and being light, I spent some time talking about the manner of which we're salt and the manner of which we're light is deeply important because I do think what has happened is even for those who say, all right, I am salt. I am light. I'm not debating my identity. We just pick without talking to the Holy Spirit, well, this is the aspect of salt I'm supposed to be. And so for some people without talking to the Holy Spirit in a very particular approach, they're like, oh, I'm supposed to be preserving and they approach it that way. And maybe that's not the manner of salt the way God wants to be in that time. certain personalities that I'm convinced just only see salt as being an irritant, right? And their thought, and by the way, there's nothing wrong with this place for salts to be an irritant. But I wonder, I'm like, we've talked about this before. If you listen to podcasts, you know, John is very handy. I am not. And so for me, I will have a tendency that every problem can be solved with a hammer. Because it's my favorite tool. It's the one I know how to wield. But if I went to John's house, and John was, you know, kind enough to help me do some help me help him in his house, he'll be very clear about what are the appropriate tools because he has a sense of understanding and knowledge. I think there's a lot of us as believers, well intentioned that only have a couple tools and we think, well, this is the aspect of salt and to be here's my hammer, I want to be an irritant. By the way, that there are places for hammers, there's nothing wrong with that. But not every job needs a hammer. And that is that tension when we just have information. But we don't then turn around and allow the Holy Spirit to form us with that information. We just allow our own thoughts. We allow those sort of things. And I do think honestly, was I was going back to those commentators, I was wondering, I didn't run into a lot of people go, oh, this could be anything. His point is indispensable, right? I wrote into a lot of people go, oh, he's talking about this is the aspect of it. And I thought, he doesn't say that. He just says be salt, be indispensable. And we're so uncomfortable with the lack of clarity that Jesus so often expresses throughout the scriptures, right? His comfort with open-ended, his comfort with refusing to box it into this is it, and now go and just do this, right? His comfort with, well, sometimes it's this and sometimes it's that, and I was also, again, for those that have listened for a while, I spent a lot of years as a high school history teacher and it makes me think of, because I specifically taught sophomores for most of that career and 10th grade is when you learn to drive. And so while I was never the driver's ed instructor, I heard all the stories and you heard from the kids that were acing the tests and then got into the car and found out that everything they knew about driving did not transfer to how do I functionally use these pedals on the floor? How do I functionally turn this wheel in a way that doesn't result in throwing everybody else in the car around? How do I engage with everybody else on the road who in some cases has decades worth of experience that I don't? I may be coming in fresh, being able to label every single sign and know the responsibilities of four-way stop signs and crossing railroad tracks and everything else, but I don't know how to drive. Yeah, I may be able to operate the vehicle, but it doesn't mean in this particular situation, driving there and that sort of thing, I know how to operate in that scenario. And I know this because when I got my license, not two months after I got my license, I got in an accident because I knew how to operate a vehicle, but I didn't understand the conditions and now I needed to adjust accordingly because that accident happened while I was obeying the speed limit. That accident happened while I was doing everything technically correct. I had all the information, but I did not understand the environment where to change and apply. And that's the exact type of thing we're talking about here. And this is one of those times where we have to acknowledge, you know, we have to have sort of a Mia Culpa moment as a church. Drivers are trained. You start in the classroom and then you go to the parking lot. And then you go to the 35 mile an hour roads around the parking lot where you really can't do a ton of damage. And then eventually you work your way up to, let's get on the highway for about two minutes and then let's get off, but you need to have the experience. And then let's progress. As a church, not just CFC, but the church writ large, we have not always done a great job of discipleship, of the driver's ed of faith, of this is how you drive in the parking lot. Let's get used to this car. Here's how you drive in neighborhood roads. Here's how you drive on four lane neighborhood roads. Here's how you drive on the highway. And oh, by the way, there's this place called New York and Los Angeles and everything you've learned here has application there, but it's totally different. Totally different. And then by the way, if you drive down highway one in California, you're not going to deal with the traffic, but you're going to deal with the temptation of driving off the road because you're staring at the scenery. And then by the way, there's places where people drive on the opposite side of the road and you can manage the car there, but everything you know is backwards, right? There's all these situational applications to the thing, you know, when it comes to a car and there's all these situational applications to these things that you know about faith and life with God. And most of us haven't been trained how to do it. Which John, in some ways was what I was attempting to do in sort of pulling out this quote now. Every time I bring in a particular subject or that sort of stuff, application into what I'm talking about on Sunday that I know for some people in me that they're going to be like this. I'm always trying to be careful to listen to the context of what I'm saying. So we are assuming number one, you've listened to the message, okay? And so there's some more context in the message that's not here. But this was a quote that I use trying to talk about this idea that you have the ability to operate a vehicle, but doesn't mean you know how to drive in this particular context. Matter of fact, many times the problem is you take that context and apply it to a new context and then you wind up with problems. This is what it was. A guy named Craig Blumberg, I came across this as I was studying. Jesus did not call us, right? So Jesus, when he said to be salt and light, he said this, he did not call us one, to control secular power structures, neither are we promised that we can Christianize the legislation and values of the world. A lot of people are getting nervous right now because he's making a political point. He says, but we must remain active preservative agents. We dare not form isolated Christian enclaves to which the world pays no attention. What he's trying to get at, what I was trying to get at is sometimes we get means and ends mixed up. There are times where we are to be involved in secular power cultures. Absolutely. There are times when we are supposed to be involved in Christianizing legislation. Absolutely. But that is not the call. That is a way to get to the call of being salt and light. And I think what he's trying to bring up is, is that we can begin to fall in love with methodologies without asking God how, so that in certain times the promise isn't we've got control of the White House or we've got control of Congress or we've got control of our local school board. That's not the promise. No. But something uniquely in the United States of America that we're blessed with this freedom of a vote and impact was, was never even considered when you're reading, you know, the early church under the influence of Rome, right? They didn't have any of those options. So they had to look at this and say, okay, there are other ways have to be salt and light, which means that we can be salt and light without these particular ways, but also don't ignore these particular tools. But I think what he's trying to get at is, is that, are we asking the how Holy Spirit how, and that means for some people, we do this publicly in the public sector. For some people, we don't do this in the public sector. That doesn't make one right and one wrong because of the outside of what they're doing. It makes one right and one wrong based upon the call of the Holy Spirit specifically in their life. Because there's a flip side and, and I guess one of the other things he's doing, and I think this is part of what we're talking about is a tendency to go to either extreme. I'm going to be deeply involved in all of this. I'm going to do it all this way, or I'm going to remove myself completely and utterly from culture and create my own, for lack of better terms, little, you know, convent of people. And what's really interesting, John, is if you take the sections of scripture and you separate them out, the whole of scripture from the whole of scripture, you can make an argument for both extremes. In fact, there's a classic book out there, if you've never read it, if you're into books called Christ in Culture by Richard Niebuhr. So Christ in Culture, he takes a look through the lens of scripture at historical ways people have engaged culture, been salt and light, and he doesn't make an argument for you should do it this way, this way, this way, this way. Christ transforming culture, Christ overcoming culture, there's several of them. But he is going to different sections of scripture and saying, well, this is where people got this from, which lends us to this answer, that there are different times, different appropriate ways to be salt and light. The important is, is we don't allow our information bias to make that decision, but we go to the Holy Spirit and we say, how do you want us to do this? Sometimes he's going to act, or rather going to tell us to act in a way that is most comfortable to our personality. You know, those people who are comfortable just being chill and say, hey, I just want to be an influence. And he's like, hey, just be quiet and sit there and be with me and influence and wait for your moment. Like, yes, that's awesome. For those people who are very comfortable being irritant, he may go, I want you to go out, yes. But he might also say, I don't know, you who want to speak, I want you to be quiet. You who want to be quiet, I want you to speak. And I think there's lots of reasons for it. But one of the greatest is he knows, number one, what's best at that moment. But number two, I think that we have a tendency of acting out of what we believe our earthly strengths are. And then when something happens well, we also then have the tendency to think it was our power that did it. And whenever we get lost or believe that it's about our power, it never, ever, ever ends well. It may fool us for a while, but it will not end well, because it's not by might, not by power, says the Lord. Some trust in chariots, some trust in horses, if you go to the Old Testament. It's by his spirit. That's how we do things. And like we talked about at the beginning, God is more interested in who you're becoming than what you're doing. And he doesn't need you to do things for him. He wants you to do things with him. And so that implies it requires a relationship. And it doesn't. Yeah. And I think for some people, when they hear that, they can think that what we're saying is that we are not people of action. Right. It doesn't mean don't do anything. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it's this idea of if we take it into all kinds of other analogies, just take it into baking, right, you will produce better baked goods as you become a better baker. Right. But if you start trying to do baking without understanding some of this transformative stuff, you might get it right every once in a while, but there's a chance it's going to be a lot less qualitative, quality good. So this call isn't when he says God's much more interested in who we're becoming than what we're doing, that God doesn't care that we do or don't do stuff. It's actually an understanding that the more that we become more like Jesus, the things that we do are more effective. The things that we do are more like Jesus, because listen, there's no more countercultural person to any culture that's ever existed in any society than Jesus and the culture he was in. I mean, when people thought he should have gone right, he went left. Yeah. And we know he went left because yes, he was God in the flesh. But scripture says he didn't do anything without the Holy Spirit, God's voice speaking in him to do it. So he modeled for us what it's look like if we could live in perfect harmony to follow God. But he says that I'm the deity card, so we can't follow it. Right. And so sometimes that looks countercultural. Sometimes it looks different and that's why we can't just assume we have to know the how from him. Yep. We have to ask. And you made this point on Sunday. And so we wanted to bring it back to here because again, the first episode of the season is sometimes a little bit of a catch all, it's a little bit of a reorientation. But the goal of the Faith Forward podcast is always to be practical, always to be practical. And on Sunday you talked about essentially the litmus test for this. How do I know if I'm being salt or light the way that I'm supposed to be? And again, it's situational, it's not about learning how to be salt one way. It's only for seasoning food and it's always a half teaspoon of salt in every recipe, no matter what. That's how you be salt and all the other uses don't apply, right? There's a litmus test for every situation and you pointed us back to the Beatitudes. So we do this often. We look at a section of scripture and not understand or realize it exists in a larger context. So one of the things that we need to grasp about Matthew chapter five through Matthew chapter seven is a continuous narrative. It's called the Sermon on the Mount wherein Jesus spoke this in order. It's not that an author through the power of the Holy Spirit then put things in a different places in a compilation of things he said. He spoke this in order. He is the God of the universe. He is smart. He's intelligent. And anyone's ever put a talk together realizes that an effective talk moves from one point to another, to another, to another, to another. Matthew chapter five through Matthew chapter seven really is trying to show us of what it looks like if we live this way. This is what it means to have the victorious life. This is what it means to have life in the full. This is what it looks like to take your faith forward into every part of your life. So he says, blessed are, blessed are, blessed are. And you could go through those and there's many of them there through a chapter five verse three through chapter five verse 11. And in my life, there are two ways that I can look at this. One seems to be a little bit easier than the other. If I think I'm being salt and I go back to the beatitudes and it contradicts the beatitude, then I'm not. Well, let me take that back. I am being salt. That's worth throwing on the road. Sure. Right. I'm being an effective salt. Yeah. Here's one. For example, verse 11 says, blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and that are all kinds of evil against you. Okay, listen, there are lots of people out there have a relationship with Jesus Christ who people who don't have a relationship with Christ, dislike them, revile them, say all kinds of negative things against you, but we can't miss the last part of verse 11 because it says they do it and they accuse you falsely on my account, on Jesus' account. So that means that if we look at the beatitudes and people don't like us because we are actually being like Jesus, there you go, it's right there. But there's a chance that we could not be liked just simply because we're being jerks. And that's not Jesus. It's not Jesus. That's how it doesn't line up with that. It says, you know, blessed are the poor in spirit, blessed are the meek, meekness is strength under control. Right? And if we believe that, oh, we can't ever do this or we're being a doormat, well, we're not opening up to this reality that there are times where Jesus says, be strength under control because strength under control isn't being a doormat, but it doesn't mean that every moment I've got to scream at you every moment I have to this. But there are moments where look, being like a peacemaker doesn't mean being a peace appeaser. It means being active because Jesus was really active in bringing peace. You know, we see later on in Revelation, his peace comes with a sword. So there are different ways. And so one of the things is I'm looking at my own life as I look at how I'm trying to be salt better with the help of the Holy Spirit, how I'm trying to be light better than the Holy Spirit is, how does it line up with the Beatitudes? Because he set that up before he said salt and light, he said these things. So there is a connection there we cannot miss. And so if you're looking for a practical how, faith forward, you know, moment in your life how is what we're doing lining up with this? And if it immediately says it is the opposite of this, I could say this, we're not being the type of salt or the type of light that Jesus wants us to be. And so again, the goal is always to ask God. The goal is to start with blessed are those, blessed are the poor in spirit, right? To recognize that there's still so much more. And poor spirit means a lot, but humility. If I enter a scenario with pride, I'm, I'm done at the beginning, right? The recognition of what I don't yet have, of what I don't yet understand, of what I haven't yet experienced, of how much more of God there is to discover, how much more of Jesus there is for me to become like, right? To start with that instead of here's all the things I know, and here's all the things I've done, right? To present your resume. Yeah. Right. That, that, that's a great place to start. And again, the goal is always to ask God. The goal is also to not get caught up in performance, right? This isn't about having to go and do, and that was one of the things that I loved about that quote from Craig Blomberg that you brought out is it's sometimes so much easier to go and do than it is to ask God. Because if I ask God, he might tell me to do it in a way that I'm uncomfortable with, or he might tell me to not do anything right now, that right now I'm supposed to wait. And there's plenty of well-intentioned people that I've encountered that are like, but, but we have to act now because if we don't, something will happen. And the number of times that I've looked throughout the scriptures and God's like, no, no, no, wait. Stand there and wait. Yeah. And again, that can't become the prescription itself. We're like, all we ever do is wait now because that's the moment that I'm going to choose to stand on. But it's the recognition just like David does with God, God, the enemy is coming out. What do I do? God says, go out and attack them head on. Okay. Next time, God, here comes the enemy. Should I go out, attack them head on? No. Wait for the sound of marching in the treetop. Then go, oh, we're doing it different this time. Got it. Right. Israelites marching around Jericho. So we're always going to march around cities now, right? This is how we, no, I got something different for you. Okay. God, AI, we got it. You took care of Jericho. We got this. Yeah. Because we're doing something different. The connection between, if you go back to Joshua, if you know the story between Jericho and AI, it shouldn't have been, we're doing this in our own strength is like in Jericho, they asked God, right? Because they knew they couldn't do it. They took that formation by information and thought they could do it in AI. We know what to do. We've got this. We've got to talk to God when there's a whole nother set of problems. I think one of the tensions, and if you're hearing this, we're not saying don't take action. There's not, we're saying we think that if there is a, a larger problem, we tend to move in action before we talk to God, then inaction, but there's just as much of a problem. If we don't do action, we've not talked to God either. They're both problematic. And that's part of the, the quote that Bloomberg was talking about going to these extremes. I don't, for me, practically, this is for me. One of the reasons I struggle sometimes with inaction is because it's not measurable. We like to see results and we believe results happen through things that we can measure. And so if we say I'm supposed to go do this and we see someone, we can measure irritation with us. We can measure what we think is someone's answering right there. We can measure all that sort of stuff, but it's much more difficult to measure obedience when obedience looks like, I want you to wait. And we do become, in fact, I'm doing a thing recently, talk with guys that one of the big problems with King Saul was that eventually his character caught up with his competence in that all kinds of people thought he was great for what he did, but he wasn't doing it the way God wanted. He wasn't waiting when he was supposed to, wasn't do that. And eventually it catches up. And when we get ahead of God, even if it's well intentioned and we don't ask, it will eventually catch up. It may not all fall apart or whatever, but it won't be all that God wants for us and for others. Yeah. And so I'm, I'm so captured by this, that there's any number of things that Jesus does make clear. And it's not a, he makes it clear. This is the way you always do it, but there are fundamental principles, right? The Beatitudes are a great example. And there's another one that he brings up in John 15, you know, I am the vine and you are the branches, right? And anyone who abides in me will bear much fruit. And so it's this implication of whatever you're doing and however you're doing it, you are supposed to remain constantly connected to me. It's not a going away and a coming back, right? This isn't the disciples moment where I'm sending you away from me and then bringing you back to me. Your invitation for the rest of your life is to abide, to maintain connection 24 seven. Just like Jesus said, I only do what I see the father doing. I only say what I hear him saying, right? I am abiding. I am connected 24 seven to the father. And what comes out of me is the fruit, right? We talk about the fruit of the spirit at the end of Galatians, right? It's not, you strive really hard to produce these things. It's that this is what comes out of you because you have the spirit in you and you're connected to it, right? And then you look at some of the people that walked with God closely. You look at that Hebrews 11 hall of fame of faith, right? People who not only just did things for God, but walked with him, listened and obeyed. And one of them is David, the author of so many of the Psalms and Psalm 27 is one that sticks out for a lot of people. And David has one request. One thing I ask of you, Lord, the thing I seek most, I would dwell with you all the days of my life, delighting in you, right? Abide and dwell. That's the invitation for the rest of your life with God. And it's not inaction. It's not, if you've heard abide and dwell as some earthly version of sitting on a puffy cloud in heaven for the rest of your life with a harp, like that ain't it. That is not it. David was a phenomenally active person. Jesus was a phenomenally active person. And between those two, you have this abide and dwell. That's the invitation, the litmus test, the beatitudes, right? How am I abiding and dwelling? Or to go back to Craig, am I just trying to do what I know how to do out of my own strength? Because I know how to be salt this way. I know how to be this kind of light. And so let me just keep doing that because I don't like being inactive and I don't like the discomfort of possibly asking God, how do I do this another way? And feeling like, I don't know how to do that. Which is the place that God ultimately needs to take all of us to the place where each of us goes, I don't know how to do that. He says, exactly, welcome. This is the beginning. This is the beginning of your life with me, a place where you don't know because he does. And he cares more about you discovering who he is and who you are than he does about what you're doing for him. So I don't know if we've made this practical or not in this first session back, but this is the goal and this is the heart behind everything that we do on this platform and everything we try to do as a church culture here at CFC is there is so much of the kingdom yet for us to experience and there is so much of the kingdom that God is still bringing to earth and he wants us to partner with him, not do it for him, but do it with him and along the way discover who he is and who we are. And so thank you, whether this is the first episode you've been a part of, or you've been through all 80 plus the last season. Thank you. Thank you for your heart for God and thank you for your heart in wanting to discover more of who he is and more of who you are. Yeah. Ditto. Let's say that again, anything we said you'd love to talk about, we would love to talk to you. You can send us an email about faith forward at faith forward at CFC wired.org. We'll get back to you. Whether you want to talk about something that we've said now just in this time together or whether we've said before, or whether you would just like to comment on our brand new fancy background. That's fine too. Yeah. Season three. We got an upgrade. Yeah. Whatever it might be. Season two, we got an upgrade. We did. Yeah. Well, we're trying. We're trying. Slowly but surely. Yeah. So as always, thank you all for being a part of this journey with us. We appreciate it. And we'll see you next time. Bye. Bye.
