Welcome back to the faith forward podcast, John Ackerman, Brian bales, and it is summer. It is summer. It is. And that means something way different to me now that I'm no longer in the classroom than I think it ever did before, because it kind of feels like, wait, it's summer. I don't know. But it's significant for us because we've gotten into a rhythm on the faith forward podcast of taking a break for summer. And so this will be the last episode for the summer break until we come back in the fall. Yeah. And so that'll be somewhere around in September and those sorts of things for our faithful listeners. And it's not because we're lazy, because if you're a long-term listener of faith forward podcast, we went through certain rhythms last year. And one of them, we talk about Sabbath and the appropriate way of resting for refreshment, for worship, and just for the good of our souls and hopefully for the good of you. So hopefully when we come back after this season of rest, we'll be in the words of someone I heard back and better than ever, we'll see, but yeah. So as we wrap up for the summer, we're also wrapping up this series that we've been calling heartbeat God's heartbeat for us, which interestingly does include rest. So well-timed. We're once again, going to combine a couple of weeks together in one podcast episode. What we thought was your final week. And then Mike Haynes, who decided after the fact to incorporate his message into the heartbeat series. So let me make a confession. No, you don't know this. You don't know this. I love finding things out live. And I want to actually give like a little inside scoop for those of you who take the time to listen to faith forward. That was not Mike Haynes fault. That was mine. So you like to use the term last one, the penultimate, right? I had to look it up. That means the next before the last, right before the last, but that was my fault. And here's what happened. This is probably why I need a Sabbath in some ways. It was the last matches I was going to do in the series. And somehow in the midst of it, even though just a little behind the scenes stuff, I lay out the series stuff with a team, but I put it on a schedule, all that sort of stuff. So there is zero excuse for me. I could say someone else put it on there. No, no, no. This is all me. And so Mike, who was preparing his message that he just gave on Sunday, on Monday, sends me a text and this is how it goes. He goes, Hey man, I listened to your message. So Mike oftentimes is upstairs in both hours of the high schoolers. So he listened to it on Monday, I listened to your message and I thought I was supposed to give the last one. I'm like, Oh my goodness gracious. So that was on me. And so Mike graciously took one for the team and made it look like it was him, but honestly it was me. And so we are now going to talk about the truly penultimate and the ultimate one in this series, heartbeat. When we talk about what I talked about last week and what it means to have contentment. And what Mike talked about this Sunday is that the heartbeat of God is not supposed to be lived out in isolation. And so just as a reminder for this series, God's heartbeat is everyone is redeemed. And then when we're redeemed, we live from all of the reality that redemption brings. And one of the things that I tried to talk about as we get near the end of this series is some things that redemption, if we walk in the reality, will produce in us. And one of it is, is this idea of contentment and too often as Paul talks about in Philippians, if we're not careful, we allow other things to define for us what should make us content that are good, but not actually the right things. And don't get me wrong, things about having money in the bank account or being in good relationships with our friends or not being in prison, because Paul was in prison, right? They go, those are life is good, as I illustrated a couple of weeks ago, but really that is not the truth. What it is, God's trying to help us understand that life is not good based upon our circumstances, but it's based upon our relationship. In fact, I use this quote that I found just a couple of weeks ago when I was prepping for this, that things ultimately do not matter. Relationships matter. And the relationship that matters most for us as believers is the relationship we have with God, our Father through Jesus Christ, the one who's redeemed us. And so that allows us, as Paul said, to be able to be content no matter the circumstances. It doesn't mean we're not grateful to not be in the circumstances they were at. He was grateful for the gift that he got when he was in prison, but he was really trying to model for them that that didn't determine his contentment. And so I think there's a lot for us, and we're going to talk about this to flesh out, and we'll talk about it just a moment that, well, what does it mean to look like then to be able to have contentment, to live in that way? And we talked about then developing a redemptive vision, and we're going to flesh that out a little bit. And we also talked about this idea of not only developing a redemptive vision, but to develop an eternal perspective around what's going on in our life. Then this week, just heard it hopefully, and again, we encourage you often to hear the message before we talk because it adds to it. But if you're not doing that, you're doing it the other way around, definitely go back and listen to what Mike had to say, is that Jesus asks us through the apostle Paul in Ephesians chapter four to make every effort to live this life together. And what I loved about what Mike was doing was he wasn't discounting what we go through. He wasn't saying that's not important, but what he's saying, it really actually says every effort. And the truth is for us, many of us miss out on the greater aspect of our redemption, of what it looks like to live in community and to live that, whether that community looks like coming and being a part of a group of people that you might call a small group or a life group or just a Methuselah group. I'm running joke with that, right? You can call it whatever it might be, but people who come around and grow in scripture, who know each other together, who know each other better, who grow together and then show the love of Jesus together, whatever that group is, coming on whenever, if you're a part of Christian Fellowship Church, on a Sunday when we gather together or a Wednesday, if you're a part of another church, whenever they gather, that those are the aspects of one of the ways to live that out. And I believe there's an absolute more powerful, to use the big term, apologetic for the gospel when there's a group of people living out the heartbeat of God than there is just one. And not because a group of people are more important than one, because scripture says he'd leave the 99 for the one when we look at the Luke 15 parable. But there's something when we think about a whole group of people being able to do this together that I believe is a powerful testimony to the world, because one can be an exception. A group tends to be, no, no, no, that's not an exception. There has to be a rule here. And so we'll talk a little bit of that when we go some more. So that's where we are. And so as always, the goal of the podcast, the goal of the platform is to make things practical. Yeah. This one's going to be a little trickier because developing a redemptive vision and eternal perspective and making every effort to not do this life alone, that ain't going to happen by the end of this episode. Whenever you're listening to it, it's not going to happen by the end of the day. It's probably not going to happen by the end of the summer or whatever season you're listening to this. Yeah. I'd like to suggest, especially when we talk about developing a redemptive vision, that we might need to say always refocusing our redemptive vision, because we might develop one in an area and then later on discover, oh, my vision's off a little bit of that. It is one of those things where God's continually working in our lives. And so the preface to make up front with this episode is that we've got some helpful things as we always try to do, things that we've gleaned from the scriptures, things that we've gleaned from our own experiences in this life and in this life with God. But the leading preface is, this goes slowly and that's good. And there's some very helpful, very intentional things that we can do along the way. You know, one of the really helpful, I think, cultural movements that I've seen in the last couple of years is this idea of micro habits or atomic habits. And as catchy as it sounds, I mean, the fundamental premise is not only very sound, but it's been true throughout history, which is you don't make big changes quickly. You make big changes slowly if you want them to endure and if you want them to be good. You know, you say, you know, micro habits. For me, that's not a new term. That's a term that's been around a whole long time. I think there is a guy named Dr. Leo Marvin in a movie that said it's baby steps, little by little by little by little. It's, you know, what about Bob, if you want that old reference? But it's a classic funny movie. But what's really interesting is sometimes even in culture, it reveals the reality of scripture because all truth is God's truth. And even when in culture we stumble across, like change many times is this incremental baby stepping, micro atomic, which really takes it down to like this small level and think of atomic. And I think it also challenges this idea that many times we don't think progress is being made unless it's this big thing. But many times it's the culmination looking back of those steps. Yeah, absolutely. So we're going to go through some of the points that you made in what we're now calling week seven about developing a redemptive vision and internal perspective. And we're going to walk through some of what Mike did most recently in this ultimate week on God's heartbeat for us. And so to start with this idea of redemptive vision, we're going to put it right up front today, as we so often do, that if you want to develop a redemptive vision, much like Paul had, the way to do it is to ask God to show you, to ask God to show you his vision, the way that he sees the world, the way that he sees the kingdom, the way that he sees you, the way that he sees others. Ask God, because as part of developing a redemptive vision, there's some reframing of our vision. There's some clarifying of our vision. There's some correcting of our vision that's needed. And one of the things that you were talking about last week around this idea of developing a redemptive vision is trying to make sense of the times when things hurt. Yeah, because I think that's when we more often than not go and ask these questions like, God, what are you doing? As we should, which is an indicator, I probably should be just as much asking God, why is this going well? Right. But that is, those are the times, those times of disorientation, those times of cognitive dissonance are actually physical issues going on in our life. We're like, God, what are you doing? Because from my earthly perspective, I can't see what's going on. And we're going to actually tie this into when we kick off the faith series in a couple weeks. Many times this is where we struggle about our faith. Like if we can't see how God's going to redeem this or what, we're going to struggle with our faith. And there's a lot when we think about redemptive vision that is, it's a faith step for us, but that's important. It is. And so this first part is a little bit of a throwback. I don't remember. I didn't take the time to go back and look at when we first touched on this. I think it was back in the Alien Living series, which preceded this one on God's heartbeat. But we had talked about how when things are hard, when things hurt, when the painful seasons of life come, oftentimes our initial impulse is to try to get it away from us. Right. That's our natural physical reaction to pain. You step on something sharp, you move your foot. Right. You put your hand on something painful. You move your hand away. And so when pain comes, often our initial response is get it away from me. And so very much the same in our spiritual life with God, that when pain comes, our automatic response is often pray against, reject, rebuke, get it away. And one of the things that we talked about in the Alien Living series was even in the pain is a great time to stop and ask God, because sometimes we swing the other way. We're creatures of absolutes sometimes. And if it's not, get it away, get it away, get it away. It's, oh, this must be God. Let me just, you know, let me push through. Yeah. Let me take it on the chin. Let me push through because this must be God. And so one of the things that we talked about and we're bringing it back up here because it's just such a necessary reminder is I can think of at least four possible reasons for our suffering. And the first one is active oppression by the enemy and his fallen angels. Yeah. Right. And yeah, that's the stuff you want to get it away, get it away, get it away. But then there's also the reality that you live in a fallen world and things are not as they should be. And it doesn't have to be the direct oppression of the enemy for things to not be as they should be. And I want to pause here because I think there's a difference between pain that comes in our life because of our acts of commission, things that we've done, we brought on ourselves. And then just again, that fallen world that we live in. And it's really important as we're asking God to delineate those things, because there's some some differing responses immediately we need to know about this idea. So if we're having a developing a redemptive vision and we discover it's active oppression by the enemy, you know, what does it look like, as you said in James chapter four, to submit to God and then learn how to resist? That is very, very important, which looks a little bit different than, hey, we live in a broken, fallen world and I have cancer. I don't have cancer. I'm just using some illustrations in case you listen to the wrong part of the podcast. This is not breaking news. This is not breaking news, right? Because this is what happens in a fallen world versus, say, for example, there are some types of cancer that can more easily be linked to the active decisions that someone made in their life that weren't healthy. You know, probably the most obvious. I have lung cancer because I smoked two packs of cigarettes a day. Again, we all know people that smoke two packs and don't get it. But that's the difference when we need to think about that, because I think we, again, go fall into a problem if it's either either or with that. Either everything is about the enemy getting on me or no, this is just the fallen world and how we should approach it to develop that redemptive vision matters. Yeah. So again, if it's pain as a result of oppression from the enemy, James 4, 7 and 8 is pretty clear. Resist, right? That is the call. That is the correct response to pain is to resist it. But if it's because you live in a fallen world, then Romans 8 tells us that what creation is already doing is groaning, right? It's, it's travailing for that day when things are made right. And Paul goes on to say in Romans that we also groan, right? There, there are parts of us that are not yet as we are supposed to be, not yet as we are meant to be. And the call to groan is actually a very active thing that if you imagine, you know, picking up something heavy, you're helping somebody move or you're moving furniture around your house. And there's that moment where somebody else is trying to get themselves situated and you're left holding your end of something heavier. You're left holding the whole thing by yourself and your muscles are groaning. Yeah. I want to put this down. I want to put this down. I want, and you just, you can't yet, but you know, the moment's coming soon. And so that, that, that groaning, what, what you are actually doing in that moment with the sounds coming out of your mouth and the shaking of your limbs is groaning. It's the ache for release while maintaining the posture that you're being asked to hold for that particular moment. Yeah. And so I need to say again, I must really need the sabbatical because I completely messed up those last things. And thanks for covering for me. This is twice. Mike covered me even the message John just covered me because the illustration I was trying to make is separating is between active sin, not oppression by the enemy that we might not be doing anything when I use the cancer example. So kind of take that example that I used about three minutes ago and now move it down one. If you think one, two, three, I should have talked about that two and three. So, you know, one is that active oppression by the enemy to live in a fallen world. Three. Now, there we go. Yep. Don't know what's going on with me today. There you go. It is. And I have to tell you what you keep talking about holding the couch and all in my head I could hear was pivot. And I know you were doing that to me on purpose. So I'm even more distracted than maybe normal today. Sometimes it's music. Sometimes it's not. Sometimes it's another culture. Keep you on your toes. Yeah. So yeah, that third one is just, is like you said, it's the consequences of our sin that sometimes our suffering is self-inflicted, right? There are natural consequences. God's not up there with a big stick waiting to whack you, but your choices matter, my choices matter. And the times that we choose things that aren't good for us, sometimes as a loving parent, God allows those consequences to not fall completely on us. And there are times for the benefit of our growth and maturity, which is what he's principally interested in, not our comfort, that he allows us to feel more of the weight of the consequences. And so there are times where in our suffering, it's not that we need to resist it, and it's not that we just need to groan and hang on. It's that we actually need to do what 1 John 1, 9 tells us, which is come and repent, that we need to come and acknowledge that what we're doing is something we're choosing. It's not something that's coming to us. It's not something that's just a product of a fallen world. It's that we've chosen something that is not good for us. We've chosen something that is not God's will for us, not God's best for us. And while he can make all things work together for our good, which we'll get to in a second, the best way out of this is to come and repent and acknowledge our part. And as 1 John 1, 9 promises that when we do, he's faithful to not only forgive, but to cleanse us from the effects of our unrighteousness. Yeah. And I think there's something that you made a note here about that just jumped out as sometimes when you might read something like, oh yeah, that's obvious. But if you didn't read it, it wouldn't be as obvious. And as you're thinking about taking your faith forward, one of the things that, that trap that we could fall into when we're asking about the consequences of sin is to solely focus on things that we view are external actions that have externally negative consequences, but the heart is deceitful among all things, right? And so you mentioned pride here on this list of fear or self-sufficiency. And one of the things about pride, fear, and self-sufficiency is it could seem to be going well for a very long time. And so when all of a sudden God lets that come to its end, it may be really easy to focus on what was the action that God wants to get to the heart. And so one of the things that, as we have talked about over and over again, about what it means to ask God, one of the questions that, that I'm learning to ask in my life is specifically ask God, where am I lie? Where in my life am I not seeing what you want me to see? Yeah. Because I, I realized even by accident, I come sometimes asking God, thinking I know the answer. Sure. Because a lot of times, you know, I think that the natural answer is the things he's already revealed to me. Cause there are times where the natural answer is God, you know, if it's about my sin, he's like, well, you're not trusting me to be in control and me having a sin problem with control is not a new thing. I've talked about it here. I've talked about it in a bunch of places. And so it'd be really easy for me to just immediately walk in and just assume that and start walking down that when it says like, well, it might be that, but God really wants to talk to me about something else. So when we talk about ask God, listen, if you are asking God, that is phenomenal, great first step. But I might encourage you, you know, it's a bit of training, a bit of practice, start asking specifically God things. Um, and if he doesn't want to talk about that and we're he'll, he'll tell us, but being open to that, because I think we could develop this idea and this issue in God's gracious and kind, he wants to come say, all right, God, you got anything to say, it's all going left. It's all going right. And he can, but I found, I don't know what your life is different. I found that the depth of the conversation with God oftentimes is related to the specificity of how I'm interacting. The difference between when I talked to my wife about how was your day versus how was that student who was in that class who was struggling with this? It's a different type of conversation. Not a less, just different. Yeah. Yeah. And, and there's, again, this isn't just about, I'm glad you said it this way. This isn't just about the bad behavior sins. Yeah. Yeah. Right. All of us at a heart level have found ways to try to make life work on our own, apart from God. And there's so many times where we're willing to just sort of put the blinders on and go, but I'm not doing any of these bad things, right? But what about this thing over here? And this isn't about perfection, but it is about life with God. You know, one of the examples for this one, the consequences of our sin and the effects that it brings, King Saul always comes to mind, right? King Saul starts out with a pretty low view of himself. You know, there, there wasn't a lot of typical pride there in that I'm this incredible person. There was a lot of pride in the sense that I don't see myself clearly and I know better. Right. But he accepts God's call to be the King of Israel, but then God keeps telling him to do things. And King Saul keeps doing this. Yeah. But just time and again, like God said this. Yeah. But, you know, God said, Saul, don't make the sacrifice. That's Samuel's job. And Saul goes, yeah. But, and Samuel shows, go ahead. Yeah. You know, I love about that though, is that, um, and in some ways this connects to what Mike said on Sunday is that when Saul does it from an earthly standpoint, there was some decent reasons because Saul understood that the sacrifice had implications to his victory. Yeah. So he wanted to win for God and Samuel was late. Mm hmm. And I think all of us would be more in connection with Saul than we may want to admit. And I love that. It just, it hit me when using that example about even some of the stuff that Mike was talking about on Sunday. Those yeah, buts oftentimes look pretty logical. Oh, they do. Yeah. But Samuel's pretty direct when he confronts Saul and he says your yeah, buts is rebellion and rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft. And so if we're going to lay out the, I'm not doing the bad behavior sins. I'm just, yeah. Butting a couple of times your yeah. Buts are as the bad behavior sins. I might even suggest like, if, when you said this is like, if we finished the sentence, instead of just saying, yeah, but seems okay, but if we actually finished the sentence in what it's saying is yeah, but I know better. God, then it's not as palpable for me. Yeah. But if I finished that sentence, yeah, but I know better. God, then I'm like, well, I don't. And then it, then it is then. Oh, okay. I see where my sin is there. And this brings us back to the first John one, nine section that the call is to. Confess our sins, but confess in a way that doesn't just go. Yeah, I did it. Which Saul's pretty good at. Saul's pretty good at acknowledging that he did stuff. What he doesn't do well is repent. The, the internal heart change of, I did it and I no longer want to be that man. I no longer want to be that person. And that really is the call here with this kind of suffering that comes into our life as a result of the consequences of our choices, that this isn't just, yeah, I did that. Okay. Make it better. It's, I want to be different. I don't want to be that man anymore. There is a better version of me available and I need help becoming that better version, which leads us to the last one. So we've got active oppression by the enemy. Your call there is resist live in a fallen world. Your call there is to groan consequences of your own sin. Your call there is to not just confess, but to repent. But then there's times where the suffering is coming from God's intentional pruning. When we ask him, or sometimes even before we ask him to help us become the person that he says we are, that requires growth that in many cases is painful. And the invitation there is to embrace it. Hebrews 12, let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning at shame and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Consider him who endured such hostility from sinners so that you will not grow weary and lose heart. For the joy set before him, for who he was becoming and what he was ushering in, he endured the cross and that's the invitation with pruning. The challenge for us is to figure out which of those four it is. And that's not something we're qualified to do. No. And so part of developing a redemptive vision for what you're going through at the moment is this inherently embedded practice of ask God, because we are not equipped to develop our own redemptive vision. We are not equipped to define and describe what's going on around us and why it's happening and what we're supposed to do in response. There's another piece that goes along with developing a redemptive vision. You know, I think what you're talking about when you talked about this joy set before him was this determination that Jesus had made. It was worth it. And that's overwhelming, by the way, because we could almost say it this way. You were worth it. I was worth it. And when we stop and we could just end the podcast right there and say, what would it look like, but I think there's, there's a model for us in understanding that when we see suffering through that last lens, the pruning that there's worth there, I mean, yes, some suffering is unnecessary, right? I love this analogy or this example, like there's our part in God's part. God's not going to do our part and we can't do God's part. And that is really a true, but powerfully deep statement. Many times we want God to do for us what he's like, you got to make this step, you got to make this step, Brian. But then other times we're like, okay, well, God, I got this. I got it. And he's like, no, no, I'm the only one can do that. But when we talk about the site, if it was worth it, I think that if you're listening, I don't know what's going on in your life. I know what's going on in my life. Now I would call my life right now, you know, a solid B, right? Um, I could probably say it could be better than a, but man, I know there's just times in my life where it's like, it was, it was on the D minus and below scale. And I think all of us have had those moments where like, I just don't, my life isn't just like an F right now. Cause an F is, is, is, you know, it's 50, right? No, no, I got a 20 F. I mean, I haven't even shown up. So there's even ranges in that, but I think there's moments where even in those moments where we have to learn as we navigate that to find, figure out what's going on with suffering and redemptive vision. And so you asked this question, I had a chance to think about a little bit, but I'll go to you first. How have you learned John, just practically maybe, um, how to navigate some of those things that clearly are difficult and hard. Yeah. I'm cheating a little bit because the answer really is the only thing I've learned that's helpful is to ask God. Um, in just the last four years alone, I can think of any number of hard things that have been going on in my life. And had I been left to my own devices, had I been left to my own interpretation, I would have been all over the map in terms of my responses, either things that I was scrambling, scrambling around, trying to fix, or things that I would have just categorically thrown my hands up in the air and gone, I quit. I'm going to go sit down on the couch and wake me up when it's over. Yeah. And the most helpful thing has been to cultivate my relationship with God to the point where I can ask him questions like, God, what's going on here? What are you up to? And, and there were, there were times, I think I've mentioned it on this platform before, uh, a couple of years ago, I was doing a big project on this house that we're renovating and it was just grueling. It was absolutely grueling. And I woke up somewhere around day six or seven of what was a month's worth of work. And like everything hurt, everything hurt, and there was no end in sight. And all I, you know, I wanted to make it go away. I wanted to ask God, make this go away, make my body not hurt, make the work I'll be finished. Can you just miraculously, I don't know, drive a bus up and either run it through the house or offload a crew of workers or whatever. And I said, I asked the question, God, what are you doing? And his answer was a little disruptive at the time. It was actually asking the question, God, are you trying to kill me? And it was a little bit tongue in cheek, but it was also like the pain of my heart coming out, like I'm not okay right now. And I feel like I'm about to fall apart. And his answer was yes. God, are you trying to kill me? Yes. And that was like a, wait, what? Yeah. Hold on. Um, I'm going to need some explanation here, but it was the, John, there's some things that you believe about yourself that are just fundamentally not true. And the only way you're going to see yourself differently is to walk through it. And so I've invited you into something difficult to show you the truth of who you are. So am I trying to kill you? Absolutely. I'm trying to kill your false self. I'm trying to kill the flesh. I'm trying to kill the old man. Pick your verbiage from scripture. I'm trying to show you that who you think you are is not actually who you are. I want that person to die so that who you truly are lives and you see it too. And so that sort of response has become absolutely essential. And there's some stuff that I'm going to talk about in a little bit from just the last couple of weeks that sucked, but it's that, that tactical response of God, what are you doing? That's been life changing. Yeah. As I was thinking through the answers for myself, it's really interesting. I wrote down some things that I would say that I processed to get me to then ask God that question. Because there's sometimes I don't want to ask God that question. I'm angry. I'm mad. I'm hurt or whatever. And so we're doing like three quick things that helped me say, okay, let me go to God. First is to be still. Every time I find myself in difficult situations, I'm a squirmer. And by squirming, it can mean a lot of things, but it's how do I get out of this as quickly as possible? And I got all kinds of ways in my mind. Doesn't mean it works, but I've got all kinds of ways in my mind. So I've learned to be still. And then going back to the verse, we said, be still and know, be still and experience the reality that he has got. So I, for me, I've got to quiet my soul. I've got to quiet my head. I've got to quiet my, I can fix it. I've got to quiet my scenario building. I've got to, there's a whole list of things in me that have to quiet internally. Um, second thing is, uh, past recall and past recall is, is like when God has come through, why do I believe in the story of God in my life that now he's no longer God is not working in my life. And so it, even though I don't want to edges me into that. But then also I think there's these things. It's the story of God in other's lives as well. And so like when you share a story, when I share a story, hopefully, you know, if you're listening to this podcast, you don't think of that. Well, we're special people. Well, yes, we are from the standpoint that Jesus died for us, but so are you like, if that's what special means, then yes, we all are. And so that means the story of God in John's life isn't exceptional. The story of God, that God knew a few isn't. And those for me are like really practical steps that get me to ask God, because I am not, I just discovered in my life. I don't know why, but I still struggle with in the midst of chaos or that sort of stuff. I still am too slow to ask God I'm too slow or I'm too, frankly, sometimes angry. Yeah. And or I'm frank this because I don't want I never woke up once in the morning and thought, let me feel pain today. And then if it's there, I'm angry, especially if I feel like I haven't done anything other than prayed the prayer. God teach me that, you know, there you go. So I'm not trying to make fun of that if you're there. But I think those are maybe some other things. The answer is ask God. But if you're struggling with why you should ask God, I think those other three things, one, be still to go back to the story of God already in your life and then go back and see and listen to the story of God and others that you know. And might I suggest the story of God can be seen in books that you can read about things like C.S. Lewis and those sort of things. And those are helpful. I've found them to be better or more helpful in my life when it's the story of God of people I can actually touch, because, again, when they're books, I tend to make them out and to be people that they're not. That's just me. You might not do that. And along those lines, and I'm glad you said, you know, the things that you do that get you to the point of being able to ask, and particularly the stories of people and what God is doing in their life. One of the things that I found helpful for me in getting to that place where I can ask God is learning not to compare my pain. Yes. And I did that for a long time and I've heard lots of people do it. So I know I'm not exceptional in that regard. And it's either the comparison of my pain in a way that minimizes it. Other people have it way worse, especially as somebody that studied the history of the world over the history of the entire planet. You can find any number of horrific things that humanity has endured, either individually or in large numbers. And it's tempting at times to then take your suffering and stack it up against that suffering and go, well, mine doesn't even compare. Therefore, I'm not really suffering. And let me just go on about my day with that newfound reassurance that other people have it way worse. That doesn't actually help, nor does it help if you go the other direction. And you look at the people around you, especially through the social media filter and go, well, look at all their perfect lives. And here I am down in the mud and nobody has it worse than me right now. And so how could I possibly be expected to go on, given the weight of all of this that I'm handling relative to what I see in everybody else? And so until other people are suffering as much or until my suffering comes down, I couldn't possibly move forward. Yeah. And when we think about that second aspect of the comparison and no one knows what I'm going through, I think I would say this. You are exceptional, but you're not the exception. And I think one of the things that the enemy wants to do in our life, especially if he's actively oppressing us or he's getting in and trying to speak lies into the truth that God's doing by pruning us in our life, is to make us think we're the only one and to isolate us. And this goes back to, again, to one of the things that Mike said, you know, jumping ahead is the importance of living and acting in communities. But when we're going through these things, we've all thought we're unique. We're the only ones. And John, you've prayed with hundreds upon hundreds of people, right? I've had hundreds upon hundreds of people in my office in just recently, just this week. I said, you want the good news or the bad news? And I like, OK, give me the bad news before I'm like, yeah, that's pretty significant deal. OK, what's the good news? That's like, it's not unique. I mean, it's not unique. So that means that the power of God that's helped all these other people, the same power of God that can help you. And I think that just that really matters. But again, again, something you've said over and over on this podcast is, you know, not comparing yourselves. It matters whether it's, you know, OK, this other person has it worse, you know, to use the old Monty Python, it's but a fleshman. But the worst thing that's happened to you is the worst thing that's happened to you. Yeah. But then at the same time, no one knows what I was like. No, no, no. He does. More than anything, we know this. We know that Jesus knows. Yeah. Yeah. And so that's an invitation to deal with your pain and your suffering. Honestly, you don't need to minimize it, nor do you need to over inflate it. Because like you said, the worst thing that's happened to you is the worst thing. And so deal with it as such. Let it it is the worst thing that's happened. And so invite God into it in that way. Yeah. Into the worst thing that's happened to you. It doesn't need to be the worst thing that's happened in the scope of human history. It's the worst thing that's happened in your life. And that's valid. Yeah. So now let's talk about, though, the second part. We said develop an eternal perspective. And you had some interesting things that happened on the very Sunday that we're talking about this. God has some very important, unique timing. Yeah. And so again, in in the current moment that I find myself in, there's been some suffering. I was once again doing some significant physical work at this time, not on my on my house, but on my dad's house. And roofing is a special kind of pain. It is just is. It's very satisfying, but it's a special. Well, and you're a tall man. So not that it's less painful for those of us who had less stature, but it's less bending over. There's a lot. Yeah. The back, the knees, the shoulders, just all of it. It was a solid week of work and everything just hurt. Everything just hurt. And, you know, on this house that we're restoring, we've got some property. We've got some animals. We had one chicken that had to be put down while I was gone. And that always breaks both of our hearts because we care about our animals. We had another one that was sick and seemed like it was on the way out at the time. We didn't know it was going to happen. It's not made a miraculous recovery. Oh, there you go. But at the time, it just seemed like there was death and more death on the way. We'd had one of those send your car to the mechanic trips where you thought it was going to be this much and ends up being this much. And if you're listening to the audio, my hands just got a lot further apart. Yeah. And I will say this, like I had a big boom in my house the other night and we went around everywhere. I couldn't figure it out. I figured it out in the morning when I went to open the garage door and the springs had all busted on there. I was like, couldn't get the cars out. Like, that's five hundred dollars. You know, you have those. You're like, oh, what's going on? Yeah. Yeah. Our mower. Again, we've got some acreage and my zero turn stopped working and I send it to the mechanic. And while I was away, I got the phone call dead on arrival. Like this. You can either spend several thousand dollars to resurrect this or you can spend several thousand dollars to buy a new one. But either way, it's going to be several thousand dollars. Sure. And so there was just this cascade of. And so, again, if I fall into the trap of will other people have it way worse, I don't actually get to acknowledge the fact that this is hard. And if I over inflate it. Right. Then the world's ending and I'm running around like a chicken with my head cut off. Poor choice of words given the situation, but that's what it is. And so into this moment. Sunday morning, the day that you're delivering this message, which because we're doing the podcast now, I hadn't really looked at your notes that closely. The timing was just beautiful because as I'm sitting there on my couch Sunday morning before coming in. I just got what he wanted to say, and he said, today is going to be a good day. And I was realizing that there was some significant skepticism in me towards that because of this sick chicken and the dead chicken in the car and the mower and the physical pain in my body. And. And God said, I'm with you. A good day doesn't mean easy or problem free. A good day is a day spent together in close proximity, no matter what happens. And it was in my Kansas talked about this idea of one of the really powerful things that happens when we start to learn to hear from God is that God contextualizes the scriptures, right? Words that we've read a thousand times. You know, you've had that experience where somebody says something and says something and says something and you're just not getting it. And the person next to them says it a slightly different way. And they're like, oh, that makes so much sense. And you're like, I just said that. Right. All of a sudden that section of the scriptures about better is one day in your house than a thousand elsewhere. It's just clicked in a new way. That's the reason why. It's not because necessarily all the other things are gone. It's that. That's what makes a good day. A good day is a day spent with God, a day in God's presence. And he said, today is a good day because we're together. It's not based on what happens. It's not based on what gets done. He said, good is not the same as memorable. A good day is not the same as a memorable day that stands out because of the significance or the magnitude of events. A good day is not the same as an easy day where there's a lack of tension. He said, good is connection. Good is togetherness. Good is oneness. Jesus's prayer in the garden of Gethsemane, I let them be one as you and I are one. That's good. And it was just this moment where nothing changed externally. But there was an internal shift towards an eternal perspective and a redemptive vision of where I am and what's going on around me and what's most true and what's most true is I am with God and he is with me. And that's the most important thing. Circumstances don't matter. Relationships matter, right? Bingo. It's a good line. Yeah. I wish I wrote it, but I did find someone else who wrote it and tried to give him credit, you know, as we kind of make it to the end and we've, we've weaved what Mike talked about here several times into there. Um, he brings this point like too often that we buy into this belief that we're better off on our own. Certainly we know for a fact we're not better off on our own without Jesus or hopefully we know that. But walking with other people in this journey, you just gave some examples like today's going to be a good day that as you walked in and saw what God was doing with other people in your life, whether it was, uh, not, you know, when we think those moments where like, oh, it was a coincidence that God was going to talk about this today and then that's not, I mean, he knew that he works all things together again, you know, for good. Um, as we sort of like, we think about that in our life, I love how we had to process through what Mike was talking about. You know, we bought in the belief we're better off, you know, it's easier, it's this, it hurts less that if we're able to get a redemptive vision, if we're able to do an eternal perspective that we talked about, you know, two weeks ago, then some of these other things more easily fall in line. If I'm actually able to have an eternal perspective that it doesn't, I don't know what God's going to do by me being deeply more involved with other people. Actually, it's harder. It's more complicated that, but if this is what he calls me to do and I can see all these other things, I could step into it and I may or may not see the benefits this out of eternity, but I know that it's good. And that was just something I was processing as you were talking about specifically, is that, is it fit into what Mike was saying? Yeah. And so there's another invitation is to sit with that question of what have you called good and what have you called bad? And is there some redefining that God wants to do in that space? Sit with that question of where have you bought into the belief that you're better off on your own or where have you bought into the belief that you're destined to be on your own and see what God has to say about that and think about categories as well, because we're pretty good at compartmentalizing our life at times, but there's times where we got no problem being in connection with people in our family, but we isolate and work. Or we're good with collaboration and work, but we go at solo in church, like Mike was talking about, or, you know, whatever the mix and match of that is, think about work, think about family, think about friendships, think about church and sit with that question of where have I seriously entertained the idea that I am better off alone or that I am destined to be alone in this space? And like you said, we hit some of these highlights of sometimes we buy into that because it just seems easier or faster to get things done if I do it myself. Chief example right here. And sometimes we buy into it because it feels like it's going to hurt less and people won't let me down if I don't let them in, right? I can just preempt the pain and then it won't happen. No one will want me anyway, right? That was King Saul at the outset. That was Gideon at the outset. That was the way that people looked at Jesus as the, at the outset, born in a manger, son of a carpenter, from Nazareth, right? You're, you're a nothing and a no one who would ever want you, right? Some of us have that deeply internalized in us. And then others of us go the other way that I am so far above all these, all these plebeians, nobody's at my level, right? Where have you bought into that in some of these environments and just sit with that and, and maybe come, come back to those levels of suffering and see if some of that suffering may happen to be in places where the enemy's actively been involved in deception. See if some of it is where you've actively been involved in making choices that are not what God would have for you. So much more we could say about this as is always the case, but it's summer. It's summer. And just because we may not be making new podcasts, it always reminds us that people don't always listen to these podcasts. I don't listen to podcasts of other people when they always come out. And so even if you're listening to this and you're like, oh, it's summer, we're still checking our email. Yep. Right. Faith forward at CFC wired, whether it's this particular episode or any episode before you'd love to talk about, we would love the honor of talking to you because we feel honored that we get a chance to talk about the living risen Jesus Christ and how it makes a difference in our life and how he can make a difference in your life if you allow him. So as always, thank you for being a part of this journey with us. It's truly a pleasure. We hope that you find rest and restoration this summer. We sure hope we find it too. And we'll see y'all back here in the fall.
