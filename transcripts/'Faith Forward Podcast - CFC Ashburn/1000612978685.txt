Welcome back to the Faith Forward Podcast, John Ackerman, Brian Bales, and we're doing something a little bit different today. I mean, we're going to talk about stuff like we usually do, but instead of talking about a message that's already happened, we're actually preempting things this time by a week. By a week. Yes. Yeah. So this Sunday, hopefully you were here. We had Trisha Lott Williford on Mother's Day with a fantastic message about Noah, but when it came time to plan the podcast, we just didn't have enough lead time to know what she was going to talk about relative to what we would talk about. So what we decided to do instead was preempt your following message on May 21st, because on May 21st, you're talking about Luke 15, specifically the section, the parable where Jesus talks about a father with two sons. And there's just so much that can be said about that particular section, and so we decided we're going to talk about the younger son today, and we're going to talk about the older son next week. So give us a little bit of context about where you're going to go on the 21st. So Luke 15 is a section of scripture that actually has three stories in it. One is about a lost coin, one is about a lost sheep, and then the third story is a story that oftentimes is called the prodigal son, or other cases is called the lost son. But the truth is, it should be plural, the lost sons. There are two sons in the story, there's the younger son and the older son, and the younger son represented someone in this parable Jesus told, the older son really sort of represented a pharisaical group of people, the Pharisees specifically, but others who had the same sort of idea around them that looked at the father, which is God represented in this parable, in ways that didn't really reflect his heart. And so when we dig into this in a week, we're going to have to grapple with a misunderstanding of the father's heart in lots of ways. And what I'm going to say in a week from now is, is I'm not going to spend as much time on the younger lost son, because that is actually when this parable is taught, in my experiences at least, where a lot of the emphasis is. It's not like there's not a lot of good things. In fact, that's why we're doing a whole podcast about it. But there's some real specific things we're going to talk about in this podcast that even if we did on Sunday, I don't think that we could have time to get in. So I'm really excited that we're doing this. But it's really beginning both for us to understand whether you're now listening to this and going back to hear this, because maybe you came in a Sunday from now and you heard me talk about the older son and mentioned that we did a podcast on the younger son and you're coming back, or whether you're getting a preemptive view into it. There's so much around this idea of grace and the grace of God that we don't understand. A friend of the podcast, used to be on staff here, a friend of John and I's, now he's a lead pastor at a church here in Ashburn called Mount Hope, Chris Eades. He has this term that he has used for decades called scandalous grace. And I think that applies so perfectly that the grace, which the father shows both to the younger son and the older son could be considered almost offensive. It was offensive in that culture. And truthfully, I think it's fairly offensive in our culture because neither the younger or the older son gets what from an earthly perspective that we would say they deserve. And one of the things, John, that you drew out of my notes, and I love the fact that we're doing this podcast in advance because I just may take some of his notes and add it to my sermon. But it was this concept that I was saying a little bit differently, but I love how you framed it. And this is it. Just because you're in the home of your father, doesn't mean that you actually know the heart of your father. So in this context, it means this, just because you are a son or a daughter of the God of the universe, our father God, in light of our series, it doesn't mean we know his heartbeat towards us. It doesn't mean that we really understand what he wants from us, how he feels towards us, that we have been redeemed, as I've been talking about in this series, and we've been saved by his grace. But that grace is even bigger than, you know, getting out of hell free. And I never want to diminish that. That would be enough. But the heart of the God, our father, is to actually also live from what the reality is of all that redemption. And one of the things that, again, that Mike talked about last week, and I feel like I'm now sitting in his chair instead of him sitting in my chair when we do the podcast, but is that we really don't, we struggle with grace. Absolutely. And in this story, there are two different people. I think there's one that abuses grace that we'll talk about today. And then we're going to take someone on the other end who feels like they have to earn their grace. And we're going to talk about that when we talk about this second scripture on Sunday. And that's sort of the setup in many ways. But I want to kind of lead you back to a conversation, John, that we were having just before we started recording was that even when we think about this parable and we use the term prodigal, so we say faith forward is about taking our faith forward into the week. But if we even have wrong definitions, it's sometimes very difficult to, you know, create a good way with the help of Jesus Christ to move our faith forward. If I start at the wrong place and I think I'm going somewhere else, I won't land in the right place. So we even back up because I don't spend any time on this redefining really what it means to be a prodigal. And I loved our conversation. Sometimes I feel like some of our better conversations happen pre or post than during this. So it's not like you're getting, you know, our leftovers, but sometimes we had to just start hitting record as soon as we sit down and just catch some B roll. Yeah. Yeah. Because we were saying that for a lot of people that have been around church, this is a familiar story. And like you said, a lot of the emphasis is often on the younger son. Yeah. And a lot of the emphasis on the younger son is all the behavioral things that he does wrong. Right. The disrespect that he shows to his father, the demand for money for his inheritance, and you know, they're completely reckless and irresponsible way in which that money and inheritance is spent on just debauchery, right. And then it often feels like it gets tied up with, you know, and so after he recognized that he made all these bad decisions, he came to his senses and came home. And it's a redemption story. It's an evangelistic story. It's praying for the lost. It is the lost coin, the lost sheep, the lost son, everybody comes home to the kingdom, the end. Yes. And yes, yes, there is absolutely that thread in there. But I think there's also the invitation for us to examine. And some of us that have a story that very much mirrors that narrative arc can look at this younger son and go, yeah, I see myself in that and thank God that I was welcomed home. Yeah. And I think going back, you could peel back and we're going to do this in the talk. He could have not disrespected his father. He could have not asked for his inheritance and he could not have always used that good biblical word debauchery, right. It feels whatever that may be, right. He could not have done all of that and still been just as lost because his older brother was as well. Exactly. And I think this, this thing that we have inside of us to be people who are focused on the symptoms before the illness, and it happens easily because you can identify them well, you can identify them well. And I think we've just been through this pandemic and we understand coming through this pandemic after however long it was, is that just because you got a sniffles doesn't mean the same thing as someone else has got a sniffles just because you got a fever doesn't mean it's the same thing as someone else have a fever, that it was really important to get at the illness behind the symptoms in order to properly align yourself to get better healthily in the same way to grow spiritually, to develop, to take our faith forward. We can't just be people who are looking at the symptoms because it is possible, especially with the prodigal or the lost son to think that the call of this is, it's how I used to, I grew up in church. A lot of, you know, this, you know, and we would have a little pithy sayings. You don't drink, you don't chew and you don't date girls that do right. And all right. So it was cheesy and bad and very eighties, Baptistic, but nonetheless, that focus could have been, all right, I'm dealing in all these symptoms, but my heart could still be in was by the way for a significant time, not aligned to the heart of God. And so this is a first understanding to understand. We need to understand that prodigal lost. Isn't as much about the things that you do, but the disposition of your heart that allows you to believe you need to do the things that you're doing. And I think that's really, really key because it's possible with the help of the Holy spirit to stop doing all this, or some of us have a lot of really good self-control and said, all right, I'm not going to do this anymore and be just as lost when the heart of God. Yeah. Last week, Mike Haynes and I were talking about, you know, in this, in this narrative that we've created over these first four weeks, that, that God aches for every single human being to be redeemed, right? That is his heartbeat. His heartbeat is for every single one of his sons and daughters to come home. And that when we come home, there is a place that we come home to. There is a role that we come home to. There is a position and a relationship that we come home to. And then there's a purpose, right? There is a calling. You are invited not only into your father's house, but into your father's business, right? You have a role in the kingdom. And Mike and I talked last week about this idea of with, yeah, that we don't return to the kingdom and step into the family business and start doing things for God. But the invitation has been, and will always be to do things with God. And what this story that Jesus tells captures so well is in the case of the older son, the mentality of four is very strong with that one, right? That I have to do things for my father in order to secure my place. But with the younger son, it's, I don't need my father. And again, like you said, it's not, what makes the younger son, the younger son is not the behavior, it's the heart. It's the way, you could almost say it's his sight. It's the way that he sees himself and the way that he sees his father. Because if we look at, at the narrative arc of the son, when he leaves, when he leaves the house, when he demands his inheritance, he's asking for what he feels he deserves from his perspective, what he sees as his. And when he returns after the debauchery and the time in the pig pen, when he returns and he's, he's met by his father, he asks for what he feels he deserves, which this time is enslavement essentially. Right. And, and the funny thing is that, is that in both cases, from the outward perspective, there's some legitimacy, right? As the son, he, he has some legal demand, some legal claim to the resources of the family. He's got the timing wrong, but he's got his position correct legally. And when he returns, he's not wrong there as well, that from a justice mindset, he deserves enslavement maybe at best for all the stuff he's pulled. And yet in both cases, what he's missing, what he's not seeing is who he is and has always been, and who his father is, and has always been. In leaving, he was blind. Yep. He was blind to the generosity, the kindness, the love of his father. And in returning, I mean, he had this, we'd probably call it a come to Jesus moment. Yeah. Yeah. But he still wasn't seeing clearly even then. Right. But he was seeing clearly enough to recognize I need to go home. Home is where I belong. But he's still not seeing his father clearly because when he returns home, he's still blind to the fact that his father has always been offering this sort of love and mercy to him. So this becomes maybe the first practical question for us in all this is where do we see ourselves in the younger son if we're not looking at the behavior, but if we're looking at the sight, if we're looking at the heart, where do we see ourselves in this mentality of God's just the one who gets in the way. God's the one who withholds, who doesn't give me what I want when I want it. God's the one that keeps me from having fun. I have to secure my own fun. I have to secure my own comfort and God's clearly not giving it to me. So I'll see you later, God, do this on my own. And one of the diagnostic questions that I sort of had in my head where you're talking to help us maybe say, okay, is this me? Yeah. To take our faith forward is do we understand that that's, that's the part of interesting. He understood he had an inheritance. He absolutely did. His struggle was not with the inheritance. It was the process of way it was being received. And for that, I can totally relate to the younger brother, um, to where if you've ever been in this place where you read scripture and you say, okay, I belong to God. He's my father. And I have this one scripture actually says there's a wonderful inheritance, but catch this. He says, actually, we're his inheritance. That's a whole nother podcast for a different time. But it says he provides for us. He does all this. And then we're in this moment where we feel rightly or wrongly a particular way. And we begin to think, ah, if I don't take what is given to me and owed me, and I don't make something from it, it's all going to be squandered. It's never going to work. Or in this case, he did squander it. Right. And again, you can't get too much dissecting into a parable because there's a main point, but we're not really sure, you know, exactly all the ways that he squandered it. We're not sure. Maybe he just decided to make a really bad investment deal. And while he was making bad investment deals, maybe just, maybe he hit it big for a little while and then he didn't hit it big. You know, who knows what's going on. That really isn't the point as much as around this idea of the how, the process. And so if you're in this place where like, okay, what I get it, I'm redeemed. What I get it, I'm supposed to live from that redemption. But the how that this is playing out in my life, if I don't grab it, if I don't do it, I'm just not going to get anything. I'm not going to get anything. And I think that can happen lots of times in a way when we play the comparison game. So this section of scripture is written very much to a Hebrew Eastern world, not our Western world. And so one of the things, if you're not familiar with this, I don't mention this in the talk at all, is that in the Western world, the eldest women and women got almost nothing in inheritance, but the eldest son got two thirds up front and then it was split among the rest. Right? So we know that according to the parable, there's only two here. Maybe there's more who knows again, made up story, but so he's getting a third. How easy would it have been? And I don't know in that culture if they even thought about that wrong or not. I know. Let's just take it though from our Western culture. How many times have we looked at another son or daughter of the almighty father? And we have somehow developed this idea that they're getting a two thirds inheritance and we're not getting as much. And so what I need to do is I need to take over the process. And so if you've ever found yourself wanting to take over the process because you don't feel like you're getting enough and that getting enough could be an internal thing or it could be looking at John's life or looking at my life or looking to someone that you're watching this podcast with life or whatever, or someone that you see on TV or whatever might be social media. Say, well, I don't take this into my own hands. That is example of not understanding the heart of God because the heart of God loves us enough to redeem us. And he certainly then, because he's all knowing, all powerful and all loving is that heart of him that also then is going to take care of us. Even when I struggle, I'm just going to use me, but we all do to really understand how that's happening. Yeah, absolutely. And so again, if, if this is reframing this story in a way that you've not thought about before and there's no condemnation or judgment on this, but if you've often just skipped right past the younger son, because you felt like, well, that's not my story. Maybe it's, you know, I grew up in church and I always followed all the rules and none of the drinking and smoking and girl dating of, Oh no, no, I won't take that. Like, so the story of the prodigal son didn't hit me until I realized the story of the lost sons. I mean, it took a lot longer to realize. And, um, there, there's a book that a lot of people read by Henry now and, uh, about it. And he spends a lot of time about the older son and he, he looked at the famous painting of the prodigal son. We don't recommend books a lot here. Not like we don't read or it just doesn't happen a lot. I will say this Henry now on book on the prodigal son, deeply transformative for me in my life to look at my struggle of how I never looked at the prodigal son properly. Cause I only saw one son in the picture and I didn't feel like I aligned with that, but I definitely aligned when we talk about it as lost sons, we'll save that for the next podcast. That's such a good book too. So again, maybe the first invitation, the most practical is just to invite God to take you back to this section of the scripture, Luke 15 and read it again. Ask God to help you read it with fresh eyes. Ask God to help you read it. Like you've never read it before. Ask God to help you read it. Like you're hearing Jesus teach it for the first time and see yourself in it. Where are you missing? father's heart as the younger son, as the one who feels like I have to arrange for my own comfort. I have to arrange for my own resources. God is the one who is in the way of my success. And so I don't want the fullness of relationship with him. I would rather do this without him. I will acknowledge the fact that he is my father, but that's the extent of it. Right. And so for us, part of this as well is embracing the reality that this is going to be an ongoing process. You know, like you were talking about with Henry Nowen's book, however far into your journey with God, there was suddenly fresh understanding of, oh, wait, there's more of me here than I realized. Somewhere between the age of 34 and 40, because I know who gave me the book and I know where I was working at the time, but I don't remember when. And while that may seem really old, it probably is to some of you put in perspective that I'd been a believer since like the ripe old age of four. So we're talking 30. I grew up in church. I mean, the story of the lost son, the prodigal son, I mean that we got Joseph and he's wearing his flannel graph coat. We've got Daniel in the lion's den with it. There's some core stories you learn growing up in Luke 15 really was in the way. I don't know if it was taught to me or just caught by me or just what was always that focus on. Well, you don't drink, you don't chew and you don't hang around the girls that do. And I keep saying that because it was a whole lot of growing up accidentally transformational belief around behavior modification. Yeah. Okay. And if you, if you look at this story and you believe the key to this story is just behaving differently, then we have a problem because this is not just about behaving differently. This is when we can behave differently because we have a heart that is now thinking differently that it has been transformed that the word that, you know, that we use repentance that comes from scripture, this thinking, and there was some repentance that needed to be done here thinking differently. And again, we often use repentance and it's like debauchery sort of idea. Like it's no, we need to say that I need to think differently. And especially around the younger son. Yeah, absolutely. And that's one of the great parts of Henry Nowen's book is that all of us, all of us have been the younger son and not just because of behavior, just relative sin ranking. Right. And see, that's so interesting because I'm going to bet, I'm going to bet because I don't think by the way, until I read that book, if you would have told me that I've been the younger son, I would have, I would have maybe politely nodded at you, but internally I was totally disagreeing. But we're friends enough that I probably would have gone, no, that's total crap in my mind. Cut that part out of the podcast if you don't like it. So, but, you know, this idea that what the younger son is doing, though, is something that we all do. He is going to wherever he went to provide for him what the father is designed to provide it. And that's where we're a younger son. So it doesn't have to look like debauchery. It can look like your job. Yeah, it can look like an earthly good relationship that you allow to substitute in that relationship what God does for us. We talk about the encounter conference that we do here. There's a section that we talk about in the counter conference that we use the term soul ties. And whenever you use the term soul ties, people like, what are you talking about? So the soul is our mind, our emotions and our will. Right. There's nothing magical or mystical about it. It's our mind, our emotions and our will. So that's what we mean. So we use the term soul tie. It means tying your mind, your thoughts, your emotions, your heart or your will, your actions to someone or something other than God to do what only God can do for us. And so in this particular case, there's lots of us that could be younger sons because we're tying getting significance or inheritance or whatever. And that's where it comes from. To that job or to that earthly good relationship or the list goes on and on. It doesn't have to look in this way. And I think especially because we're more Western minded and we're very concrete, I think we receive some of these parables in smaller ways than the Eastern mindset would have seen it. And again, they could have missed it. Some could have walked away with you don't drink, you don't chew and you don't hang around with the Gentile girls that do. I don't know. But I think they could see something bigger in that, that some of us might miss. This is not just about those specific actions. It's about any actions that we may take, even in good, but not God places that try to do what only God can do. And we take it in our own hands. That's when we become a version of the younger brother. Exactly. And so, again, a lot of this comes back to sight. How do you see yourself and how do you see God? Where do you see that the things that we know God can offer might be more easily accessed? Comfort, acceptance, validation, approval, all of those things. Right. And so when we look at this story that's being told, there's two beautiful moments. The second most beautiful moment in the story is the moment of the sun's awakening. When his eyes are opened, when he starts to see, starts to see clearly, when he wakes up in the pigpen and realizes how far he's fallen and the reality of his current situation, that all of these things that he chased for acceptance, approval, validation, comfort, whatever, none of them delivered and they never will. And for some of us, we've had that moment. We've hit that moment of the things that we've chased. We woke up one morning and realized they never have and they never will. And some of us haven't yet and all of us still have places where we're blind partially to where we truly believe we can find those things. And so we don't necessarily have to wait for the pigpen to discover that truth, to discover that reality. We have a God who loves us and who talks to us. And so we've reached that point in the show. Where we say the words, ask God, yeah, you can ask God to show you, you can ask God, you can ask him, help me see myself clearly. Not just about my behavior, like you said, not just about the symptom, but about the illness behind God, help me see myself clearly. And that can be a scary question. Here's a scarier one. God, where am I insisting on your blessing without the relationship? You didn't tell me that was going to be in the notes. Now I've got to ask that question right now while we're doing this. And that's profound because it's the shortcut. Yeah. It's the shortcut because that's what he was doing. It is. That's what he was doing. Yeah. Give me what's mine. I don't want you. I want what you have. Give me what's mine. I don't want you. I want what you have. Yeah. Give me the good stuff. Right. So, all right. And again, it's funny here. There's a little bit to preview next week. Just a couple. It feels weird, but yeah, whatever that there's a little bit of the older brother mentality that sneaks in here of what do I have to do to get what I want? It's the transactional relationship that we've been talking about for years at this point, but for the younger son, it's what do I have to do to get what I want? What do I wish you were dead? Dad. Yeah. Right. That's the transaction I want. I want your stuff. I don't want you. The older son. And again, we're going to get to this later, but he seems equally disinterested in the relationship. He's not wishing his father dead, but he wants what his father has. Yeah. And, and so it begs a question. And again, this may be the part that helps you access this part of the story in a way that you never have, that this is a really great pivotal question that touches both tracks. God, where, where have I insisted? Where have I demanded your blessing, your resources, your riches, the things of your house and your kingdom. Yeah. But been indifferent to the relationship. And I think this reflects many things. One of them is, is how we can have the same heart condition, Mr. And somebody, but because of personality life experience express that illness differently because, you know, one expressed the symptom of let's just go back to the COVID analogy of the fever. And the other one expressed the symptoms of let's just say coughing. They both had the same problem though. And that's really where it's profound for me in understanding that they were both equally as lost. We're both equally as, as lost and wanting. I think we're all guilty of this. I know I'm guilty. Anytime I say all I say, I think when I talk about myself, I'm pretty darn sure, um, that there've been times I've want what God offers, but not God. And here, here's what I mean by that. There are times even where I want godly things that God offers without God. So let's talk about Christian fellowship church. I know for a fact, there've been times that I've wanted what I will use the term very much in air quotes, the blessing of God without the process of God, sure. That God, I want to see you do blank, which by the way, I think it's an interesting trap that we can often disguise not understanding the heart of God with spiritual language. So how easy would it have been for someone to look at me and go, Oh man, you, you just, you love Jesus. Cause you want to see this church be blank. And I'm not going to input the blank here because some of you may then go, well, that was good or that was not the point. But what I realized, what I realized is that yes, I wanted that, but I was wanting it my way. I was wanting it without the relationship when in fact that, you know, when it says delight yourself also in the Lord and he will give you the desires of the heart. We've talked about this before. That is a relational word that is not a transactional word, rather a relational verse, not a transactional verse that what happens is, is that when we delight ourselves and we're in the relationship with God, our father, and we're spending time with him and we know his heart, then he doesn't give us what we want. It actually, that verse means he inputs, he, he transforms the desires. He aligns them to be more in his desire. And so I've spent way too much unknowing time and sometimes very knowing fighting with God about wanting to get what he, what I want from him, not with him. And it looked good on the outside because it seems spiritual. And I bring that up because some of us, some of the things that we want, how could we say those are bad? Yeah. How could we say this? But if we're wanting them without the heart of God and not with him, that's just another sign of a misunderstanding and struggle that this parable is trying to lead us to understand. Yeah. And so in full disclosure, this is an uncomfortable place to go with God. I mean, this is a little bit like that scary moment on, on TV or on a movie where it's like, no, no, look away, look away, this is an uncomfortable place to invite God to intentionally step in and show you things about yourself that you don't see, but the other option is to wait until you wake up in the pigpen. Yeah. And we don't have to do that. But I don't know of a good third option. I mean, either we find out now or we find out later, we find out through relationship or we find out through the lack of relationship. And so there's no easy option, but I think there's a better one here. And it's so important to go back to ask God. I don't know how old you are. If you're listening to this, you could be maybe in my age range. You could be a younger age range. You'd be an older age range. One of the things that, that God has revealed to me in my life is that I was revealed to me in my life is that what saved me in my twenties strangled me in my forties. Here's what I mean by that. My beliefs in my twenties got me to a place that I thought was good, but they were not understanding the heart of God. And eventually when I found myself metaphorically emotionally in the pigpen in my forties, I wasn't any different than the things I thought was helping me in my twenties. It may delay, but there really are only two. And so don't be deceived if you happen to be in a place where you think it's working now, ask God, because it might be. And I use again, this term very loosely working, but it's not working like how it tends to. And eventually it will, it will run out. It may be faster, maybe slower than mine, but it will run out. And notice, as we talk about this, notice what it's bringing up in you. I'm not telling you what it's bringing up in you, but I know what it's bringing up in me as I was first thinking about these questions is this is where God's going to nail me. He's been waiting for this. Well, I've been waiting for this moment and here it comes. John is reflecting what him. And I, if you, if you ask the two, as you're in our podcast for a while, you know, that naturally as we've grown as people, we relate initially more to the older brother than the younger brother. So part of the reason why John and I could want to many times grow in an area and ask God that I'm just going to say me, but John's personality could do that as well. It's not because I want God is because I don't want to get nailed by God. And that's an older brother thing, right? Later, later on punishment. Yeah. I want to avoid the hurts. I'm going to do it no matter how hard or how difficult it was. I love that part. When Mike was speaking, um, just last week when he's talking about, I'm just going to grip my teeth and I'm going to do it in duty. And there are places where God has to do that, but he also brings joy in those places, but I totally related to that. Well, I'm just going to suck it up and live this horrible life until I die. But I did all the right things for a long time. And that's not his, that's not his call for a life. No. And, and so notice how that's already pointing us in the direction of where we've missed God's heart, right? Because we mentioned there were two really beautiful moments in this story. And the second most beautiful is the son's awakening. Yeah. The most beautiful moment is the moment of the father's embrace when the son arrives home and doesn't have to get all the way to the house because the father comes out to meet him because the father was looking for him, the father threw aside all custom and culture and modesty and ran, which means hiking up his robe and being all sorts of inappropriate in public to get to his son as quickly as possible, and as the son is delivering this well-rehearsed speech of what I deserve, right, he's very quickly overridden by extravagant, seemingly wasteful love and grace. And it's very revealing about the heart of God that this is the response when we come to him, willing to invite him into our potential wrongdoing or our known wrongdoing, you know, that kid came home expecting to get nailed, but knowing that coming home and getting nailed was better than the pig pen. And I have to admit, well, I'm very curious. And as I was writing this down, this was just, it was coming to mind. I seriously wonder how the son initially, like those first two seconds of reaction when his father hugged him, like, was he caught off guard? Like, was there that like stiffened reaction when somebody hugs you and you weren't expecting it and like, now your arms are trapped at your side and what do I do? Like, I can't hug back. This is like, I'm just being loved. I can't reciprocate anything. I just have to be loved in this moment. How long did it take for him to soften into that embrace? Was there a moment of like actual indignation, right? Is he actually offended by this? Like, I deserve punishment. I worked up this whole speech. What, what, what, what, right? And it's just, it makes me wonder how much, even in this moment, God is already revealing to us about how we see the heart of God. What is it that we expect he would do if we invite him into this space to show us? I mean, it just, even to ask that question, God, where have I demanded your blessing without the relationship? Is there any part of you that says, you know what, I bet would, I bet God would just show up and give me a big hug. You know, obviously we're talking about a parable. And when Jesus tells a parable, we know that it is a, an earthly story with a heavenly meaning. We also know that Jesus has been around since the beginning of time. There's a good chance this has actually physically happened. Just not, you know, there we don't know for sure, but a lot of the things John that we're talking about, at least again, from my perspective is when we're talking about the possible reactions, isn't necessarily based upon per se that this text is saying these are the possible reactions is we deal and connect with people on a consistent basis that could be defined as a lost son, younger brother. I've been it. We've all been it. Lost daughter, younger daughter, however you want to use the words. And we see these reactions constantly in that way. In fact, um, it was this, you know, you said that the second most is that we begin to see, you know, the son's awakening, he's seeing clearly. And then in the notes, though, it says almost he's not there yet because he still says this is better than the pig pen, but there was no, from the story, no expectation that I'm going to be fully embraced as a son to get the ring back. And the ring means a lot of things in that culture. It really does about power and position. Even though he doesn't have much of inheritance, he still has a lot of that. There's so much there. Um, but when I engage people and you, one of the questions is what is it that we still often believe about the father's heart after coming home, because what we said at the top of our podcast is just because you're in the home of the father doesn't mean, you know, the heart of your father. So we've got the older brother. We'll talk about next week. Who's been there the whole time and doesn't know the heart. We have a younger brother who was there left. Didn't know the heart came back, was beginning to see a greater aspect of the heart. And I think for a lot of people who have had younger brother experiences in their life, they've come back, but there's still some things about the heart of God is scandalous. Grace is love that they're struggling in. And so they still believe certain things about the father's heart. And so in the last couple of minutes or so, we want to get really practical about some things that we believe about the father's heart. When we come back, that still isn't the heart of God, which can leave you by the way, lost again in the same home. Yeah. Yeah. Because if you come home, but your heart hasn't changed. Yeah. Yeah. And again, you know, not to read too much into parables, but there's just, there's questions I have, like, what was that younger son's first day home? Like, yeah, we know he comes back to the party, right. He comes back to an embrace, to a robe and a ring and sandals and all that that symbolically applies and all that that practically does for him and this feast and the fatted calf, right. I have to imagine that he woke up that next morning with at least some sense of, was all of that real, not just, was that a dream, but is the way that my father treated me yesterday, the way that he's going to treat me today and tomorrow. And John, you bring that up, obviously from, you know, a divine imagination looking in and the things that you've been through, but I know the stories of the people that you work through. I know the stories of people that I worked through that isn't made up. There are, there are many people right now who are listening to this podcast, who would struggle with this idea. I've come back, but, and I, and yeah, that grace was amazing. And that moment was amazing, but it's all gonna go away, right? Because someday he's going to come to his senses. I mean, I know God that you, you know what I did and you've given me grace and you forget, but someday, you know, it's really going to come back and you say you forgave me. Well, you're going to throw it back in my face or you can, and by the way, one of the reasons that we often believe that is right. We live in a world that many times people say they forgive or that sort of stuff. And it only lasts for a little bit. They say it's grace, but it runs out. So if you find yourself in this place where you still believe that you have to constantly make up for your mess up, that isn't yet understanding the heart of God. I don't quite understand how this plays out, but scripture tells us that when we come to God and we repent and we ask forgiveness and we've sent as far as the East is from the West, that's how far God has removed us from us. And he doesn't recount them. He doesn't, he doesn't bring them up. There's a whole lot of there. I'll never understand theologically, but I understand it. What it says is that God does not hold it against me. And so if you feel like number one, you could have never come back. That was your younger son. There's no offense you've ever done that God can't forgive us from just none. He knew everything we have done, are doing and will do. And Jesus still came to die for us in the same way, though, even when we come back, it's not too good to be true. No. And so here's another interesting question to ask God. And sometimes, you know, when we ask God different questions, sometimes he responds in different ways and he knows how we're wired. And, you know, so sometimes we're more visually wired and sometimes, you know, words and phrases, and sometimes it's more just a general sense of something. But this is another interesting question to ask God and invite him to respond in a way that you receive. You know, God, when I came home, where do I now feel like I belong in your house? Where do I feel like I belong at your table? And it's an interesting opportunity for God to help us see the reality of ourself in his house. Um, and I had somebody asked me this question as something to think about. And I've since asked myself this question and asked others this question. And, and I know that for some people where they feel like they belong in God's house is as a servant, that God embraced them just like he does the younger son in this story, the robe and the ring and the sandals, and you came home and you essentially rejected the offer and said, no, no, no. I'm going to, I'm going to take the role that I feel I deserve. You said, I'm your son, but I know better. I'm, I'm going to take the role of a servant instead. That's actually disobedient. So, um, you know, as teachers, we always like to find ways to turn a phrase when you were talking about this. I wrote a note earlier on that says, do we define ourselves through our deficiencies or our descendantship? And I think coming back to the table, when we go back to when we talked about the second week that, you know, he sees us seated, actually in the first week of the series, seated the same position, right, as he's at the right hand. And that's the position of predominance. If we think we don't even belong at the table, there's an issue. But if we even think, okay, I'm at the table, but I'm at the kid's table or I'm at the table, or I got to be at the very farthest end, because look at all it misunderstands the grace and also misunderstands what redemption and justification and all those things mean that we talk in the first week that we said, listen, yes, God desires everyone to be redeemed, but he also desires that we live from all the reality of what that redemption is and redemption says, there's no kid's table for you. There's no servant table for you. There's grace amazingly. And you get a seat. And I never know, you know, how like everybody gets that seat. That's a whole nother thing. Right. Cause I did, I reminded me of my son one time and I, and I reminded him, I said, you know, who loves you? Yeah. Who's your favorite? Yeah. I'm your favorite. You know, it's never going to change. No. I tell them that like, who does God love you? Yes. Who's God's favorite. He goes, yes. But how's everybody God's favorite. I'm like, I don't know, but that's how it works. That's how it works. Not my problem to figure out that. Exactly. And there's that seat. It's right there. It's for everybody. Yeah. So friends, hopefully this has been helpful. Um, hopefully it's been a helpful way to look at the story of the younger son, because like we mentioned earlier, all of us have been the younger son at some points and all of us, because we're all still on this journey of sanctification of, of growth and transformation and restoration, all of us still have bits and pieces of that younger son's heart. And ours. And so as always, this is invitation into more, there's invitation into more of what God has for us. There's invitation into seeing ourselves even more clearly and seeing God's heart for us more clearly. Any final thoughts? No, man, that's good stuff. Uh, come back next week. They go together. They really do. Uh, it's just different symptoms of the same illness. Uh, but the good news is no matter what your illness is, it's not greater than the grace of God. And so I'm not saying it's easy to live from that, but I'm saying it's real and it's powerful to be able to live from the grace and the redemption that comes and the more that we can live from. And I guarantee you, the more life changing it is. Yeah. And as always thoughts, comments, questions, send them to faithforwardatcfcyr.org.
