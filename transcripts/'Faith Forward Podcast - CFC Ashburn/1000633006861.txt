Welcome back to the Faith Forward podcast. John Ackerman, Lee Towns joining me today all day long, all day long, at least for however long this goes. Exactly. So if you've not been with us for a little bit, we are in our fourth week on this series called For Something Greater as we're navigating the book of Nehemiah. And over the last few weeks, hopefully you've caught, Pastor Brian and I, as we've talked through some of the things that we're taking out of the book of Nehemiah, that in the first week Brian talked about this burden that God places on people's hearts that we are then invited to respond to, not out of our own strength and out of our own understanding, but to do something with God, but something that far exceeds our capabilities. And in some cases, as we then talked about in week two, something that far exceeds our capabilities even with us and God alone, not that God is limited, but he invites us into something that we can't accomplish individually. And then it's going to involve risk and it's going to involve, as Brian said, a greater prayer life, but that's not more words, right? That's not greater effort in producing more words. It's greater connectivity with God. And so as we talked about last week, that we don't just dive into the work right away, that there is the need to go and take stock of the situation. You know, Nehemiah goes and he's got three days where he doesn't tell anybody the plan yet because he needs to go and see what's there and how that informs what God has told him. And so now Lee, as we come to the fourth week of this, and we're going to be here a couple more weeks after this, because the book's got some pages and it's got some plot twist and we want to take in all of it. In this fourth week, give us a quick summary, because as you all know by this point, you're supposed to watch the Sunday message, so if you haven't paused us here, we'll wait. We won't go anywhere. I promise you we'll stay frozen exactly as we are until you come back, but you're going to want to check out this message before you hear the podcast. But Lee, talk to us a little bit about what you said, probably said, hopefully said on Sunday since we're recording on Wednesday. Glad to. Hey, uh, so actually what I think I'll do is because the narration or the, uh, the outline of where we're going to go in this conversation is so much in the meat of the message. Um, there are a couple of things that I, you know, probably didn't lean as hard on that I think are worth, uh, maybe talking about, um, in these moments, um, we picked up where, um, Brian had left off in the previous week and, and there's that process that you walk through where, you know, we, when God says something to our heart, it's not an immediate jump in and say, okay, let's go to work. But there is, there's this time and my observation and my conclusion, even from the text, but also from my personal experience is that when God's leading me into something greater, leading you into something greater, when he leads us into something greater, it doesn't come out of the noise. It comes out of the quiet. It comes out of our time where we're with him in those small spaces for lack of a better way. Say it. And, and he does a lot of work in me before he does work through me. And so, um, so that's kind of where Brian left that off. But then the text picks up. He actually left off. If you go back and look at the, you know, the literary, um, uh, makeup, he left off mid paragraph because Nehemiah assesses the walls, um, and he makes this statement. I didn't tell anyone I went out there by secret, but then he tells someone and, and, and that's the, the paragraph pivots. And so now it was time for me to go public. And I've been thinking about this and I'm not sure I can say this is an absolute, but, but I, I'm having a hard time thinking of an exception to this rule that when God leads us to step into something greater to take a risk for him, I can't think of an instance where it's done secretly. I mean, there is a public expression of that. And again, admittedly, I I'm going to leave the door open that there may be a moment, but, but as I've thought about it, I can't think of a scenario where there's not at some point God has been working in me and I'm going to tell you that. And often when God leads us into something greater, he leads us into something greater and we go public. And the purpose of going public is because it's bigger than us. In fact, I also have this leaning inclination in my thinking that, that when God's doing something greater than us, if it's only within our capacity, in other words, if I plus God can accomplish it, it's probably not God. God's always, it's a weird way that God does this, but he's built us for others and he's built us not just for others from an evangelistic standpoint, which is where we tend to think. But he's built us for others because that's how we function healthy. And so when he calls us into something greater, again, I can't think of a place where he calls me into something greater solo, right? He's calling me into something greater for others. So it's got to go public, right? Rally around. So you see that happen with Nehemiah and then there's the inevitable resistance. And when we're following God, moving countercultural, if you follow God, there's always resistance. I think I have at times been plagued by the desire to have a problem-free life. Oh, absolutely. Not just you, my friend. So I, sometimes what happens for me, and I see it in my friends, you know, and people I work with, but in that thought process, okay, so if I'm obedient to God, then all of it's good. I love that Proverbs is, commit your way into the Lord, he'll make your path smooth. I don't know how I read that. And when resistance shows up, I go, oh, I've messed up here. But the truth of the matter is, if I'm going to be obedient to God, there will be resistance. And you know, Nehemiah runs into that immediately, as soon as he goes public, Sam, Balad, Tobiah, and Gershom, they've got something to say about it. And there's the resistance. But then, what I love is, Nehemiah says, look, you can see the city, it's in ruins, the gates have been destroyed by fire, but God has put this burden on my heart. God's given me a vision. And he never says, hey, what do you think? He just says, this is what God's done in my heart. And the people go, let's rebuild this wall. Let's fix this. And then, what unfolds in chapter three is pretty cool. And what I think happens, and this is to set us up for the rest of the conversation, what I think happens in this picture, at least for me when I read it, is I love the notion of something greater. And when I say I love it, I mean, my life story runs through a desire for something greater. And the thing that I feel like I have discovered is, if I'm going to experience something greater, I have to live a more than life. Now, we need to unpack what that means, because some people are going to hear more than and go, oh, yeah, I need more money, I need more cars, I need more, you know. But that's not what I'm talking about. I've got to lean into some more than principles, more than principles in my life in order to experience the something greater that I think fundamentally every human being longs for. And so, that sets us up. That's what I intend to say, and some of it I don't intend to say. Some of it gets left on the chopping block. So now you've heard what I left on the chopping block. Right. There's always some good B-roll footage on the podcast, so I think that's how we hold on to our loyal listeners. There you go. So as you all know, if you are a loyal listener and if you're not, welcome. The goal of the Faith Forward podcast is always to do just that. Help us take our faith forward. Help us put it into practical application and practical action. And the beauty of this message in particular is it's 100% practical. And so there again, if you missed it the first time, somehow you were brushing your teeth or driving in your car and you missed it the first time, go back and check out the message. You'll be glad you did. But as we walk through, like you said, the meat of your message, you hit kind of these three main areas of if we're going to live a more than life, it's going to encompass at least three spots that it's going to require more than me, which we've touched on a little bit already. It's going to require more than my effort and it's going to require more than I have from a resources standpoint in a variety of permutations of that word. And so we're going to take those three sections in order. And because this is already practical, we don't need to add other layers of practicality like we sometimes do. We don't need to add additional categories of practicality. So what we are going to do is just ask some questions. And I would say I'm apologizing in advance, but I'm not really, because these are good questions to ask. And to be fair, we're going to ask them of ourselves first. And I don't know if I told you that, Lee, so welcome to the show. I mean, we try to go first anyway, it only seems fair. What's good for the goose is good for the gander. Exactly. Right. In this first category of, if we're going to live a more than life, it takes everyone to build something great, right? This is going to require more than just me. And so one of the questions that you asked, and so again, if you missed it in the message, just sit with this one for a second. When it comes to something greater, that's going to require everyone, are you more of a soloist or a spectator? Are you the person that says, yep, I got it, everybody else get out of my way? Or are you the person that sits on the sidelines and assumes that somebody else is better qualified, better suited, better called, more capable? Do you recognize your defaults in that space? And so again, we'll ask ourselves the question first. So Lee, in your own life or at different times in your life, what have you noticed about yourself as either the pull towards soloist or spectator? Yeah, I love that you asked that question that way because if I say it correctly in the message, I do a dichotomy between a soloist and a team player and a spectator and a participant. And it would be easy to listen to the question, are you a soloist or a spectator and go, wait a minute, where's the right answer in those two? And the truth is that if we're going to experience something greater, neither one of them are because the reality is there's a pull towards one of those two dysfunctions for lack of a better way to say it. For me personally, I think I can see both tendencies in me, but I probably tend more towards the soloist part. A lot of times it's what every manager battles with delegation, right? It's just faster for me to do it myself. I have a clearer picture, all those kinds of things. And it's messy when I involve others and it's slower when I involve others. And I'm an impatient person, I'm a very independent worker. So my tendency in these areas is towards solo work. I'll just go do my thing and if somebody else picks it up, they pick it up, but I've taken care of my stuff, that kind of thing. But again, I can also see spectator. It's a funny dynamic about me, again, since we're answering the question for ourselves. My wife says about me when we participate in small groups or community groups or home groups, whatever particular organization it's called, that I have two default behaviors in a group. Either I come in and I take over and that's where my soloist comes from, is I'm in the room, I know how to work the room, I'm out in charge, or I completely disappear. I know in the group setting what I'm doing is I'm trying hard not to take over, but in trying hard not to take over, I remove myself. So it's really funny, the two options in the question, because I can see both of them in me and I have to battle that tendency on both of them. And I think that's true probably for all of us, that both of them live in us. Yeah, absolutely. I resonate a lot with that and there's a lot in my life that led me to believe it's all up to me. And so there's times where I've embraced that and I've said, all right, get out of the way. It's all up to me. Yeah. Right. And then there's times where I've gone completely passive in the other direction, because thank God this one's not up to me. So I'm going to sit this one out, right? Somebody else is pitching today. I don't have to. Right. And you know, in my mind, maybe yours doesn't work this way, but my mind works like this, either I'm going to be in control and therefore navigate the destiny. So if it's going to succeed because I've willed it to succeed, I'm not going to let somebody else's failure, you know, become my definition or, Hey, I'm out of it because you're going to screw this up. Right. It's not my responsibility. Exactly. And if both counts, I get to hold my hands up and go, not me. Exactly. And, and I, it's, it's just a funny reality. And so do a little pause and check there that as you look over your life at different times, perhaps, and especially bring that up to present day, again, like you said, it's not unusual for us to sort of ping pong back and forth between the two unhealthy extremes, because we're not meant to live out of either. And now that doesn't mean that there's never a time to take the lead and initiate. We're actually going to talk about that in a little bit. And that doesn't mean that there's never a time to let someone else take the lead. But what we're talking about are the more extreme ends, the it's all up to me, or I'm not going to do anything. I'm just going to sit in the stands and wave my little pennant and, and that's it. And then here's a follow-up question, and we may not dive into this one as deeply because there's a lot we want to cover. And at the same time, it's helpful to sometimes nuance this. So in your own life, as you feel the leading or the burden to do something, is it the, all right, I got it. Everybody else get out of my way. Or is it, nah, there's probably somebody else better suited to this. I'm going to sit this one out. Yeah. I'm going to make stuff happen or I'm going to wait until everyone else is here. Yeah. Just do the little, do as little as possible. Is your answer at all different when it comes to the lives of the people around you? Are you the person that jumps into another group and quickly assumes leadership because you feel like you know better? Or are you the person that if somebody else is in charge, you're getting the bare minimum out of me because it's either sink or swim on your own, or I get to take a break today or I don't want to intrude. They're probably better equipped for this. Do you notice the distinctions in your life between the way that I usually handle my own burden, my own passion and the passions of others? Yeah. Yeah. So now let's make it really uncomfortable. Wait, I thought it was already uncomfortable. We're getting there. Easing in. Starting the shallow end. And I almost didn't put this one in, but Lee, your, your message was, it wasn't pointing directly at this, but it was hard to miss that part of what we're talking about here in the story of Nehemiah is that God placed a burden on the heart of one of his people for the people of God. For the walls of Jerusalem, not exclusively, but because the walls of Jerusalem would allow for the rebuilding of the people. Just as Ezra was sent to rebuild the temple and Nehemiah is sent to rebuild the walls, the cumulative effect of that is the people of God are brought back into right relationship with God. And so it begs the question, what's your default with church? Is it to be the soloist or is it to be the spectator? And you actually laid out a few other nuanced places where we may fall. But before we do that, I want to acknowledge this first because it's both fair and right that in some cases, our default specifically as it relates to church, just like it is in most other parts of our life is linked to past experience, past hurts, past disappointments, past betrayals, past failures. Of course, I'm going to take the soloist lead because people have let me down. They've stabbed me in the back. They've not come through. They've hung me out to dry and went like this. And so never again, right? Or all those things happened. And so never again, I'm never going to step out first or in some of these other places that you laid out. And so as you walk us through them again, because again, we may not have caught this part on Sunday, allow this to be a moment of reflection. Where do you notice yourself specifically as it relates to church? Lee, you talked about predators, you talked about skeptics, you talked about critics, you talked about consumers. Would you mind giving us just a quick glimpse of what that's looked like? And again, where you may have seen those things pop up. Yeah. I mean, first of all, before I jump into those four different adversaries, you know, this is a deeply personal part for me, you know. And believe it or not, I know we've talked a lot about church hurt and things like that. The most likely people to experience church hurt are actually those who work for the church. Navigating a lifetime of employment with the church requires dealing with church hurt on a regular basis. And I've had to process my own, both in distant past and not so distant past, disappointments, frustrations, betrayals, hurts, all of those kinds of things. And I have had to do a look in the mirror at myself and say, am I limiting my yes to the place where I can guarantee that I won't get hurt again? And if that's the case, I need to stop because there are no guarantees for that, you know. So that's a radically uncomfortable question and yet at the same time, a very fresh and real journey of my own, you know, that I relate to. But I, you know, I realize in even in processing some of that church hurt and some of those places where I've been wounded and betrayed and all of those kinds of things that are qualities of church hurt, there are those, and I really even hate using the word because the truth of the matter is, within the church, in the flock, people who feel like adversaries don't intentionally wake up in the morning and go, I want to be an adversary, you know. And so I hate using that, but there are times where I'm on the other side of the equation and it's definitely adversarial. And so I kind of think of them in those four categories that we spoke about Sunday just as a refresher. We talked about predators and, you know, in the context of this story where Nehemiah is trying to build a wall, there were the predators, those who were opposed to the project. They didn't want this to happen. They wanted to be able to pillage the resources for their own, and they didn't want that. And I, in the church, there are those that want the resources for their own pleasure and benefit and use, and they don't want those. And they're just, again, they're predators and intent on destroying, you know, whatever life is there, right? And then there's the skeptic, and those are the people in this story and in the context of the rebuilding of the wall that they don't get involved because they think the project's impossible. There's a group of people that are listed in Nehemiah 3 that they did the work, but the leaders disagreed and they chose not to do the work. And so for whatever reason, they were skeptical. They were like, I'm not going to get involved because this can't be done, right? And usually those people are loudmouths. You know, they're going to tell you why this doesn't work. So at the risk of oversharing, in my world and our world as church employees, often they have a mantra, we've never done it this way before. That's one of the favorite cries of the skeptics. It's not going to work. We've never done it this way before. And so those are a set of those adversaries. And then there's the critic, and that's the person that looks at what you're doing and says that's just wrong. For whatever reason, they disagree with it. They sound like they have the moral high ground, right? So they will wear you out about the wrong nature of what you're doing for often biblical or, quote, godly reasons. I object to that because here's what the Bible says. They'll often say that. Now, I have found that that is often a poor application of scripture and a wrong definition of scripture, but that's what the critics often sound like. And then there's the consumer, that they're that person that when you did a group project, they showed up on the day of the presentation and got the A, but they never did a bit of the work. They're not going to get involved. They're not going to give themselves, but they are going to freeload. And so they will come and take and take and take, but never contribute. And so I work through those realities of the kinds of people who are on the fringes. But I also can step back and look at those kinds of people and go, it's sad because they never experienced something greater because they're refusing that process for whatever reason. Yeah. And it's sometimes hard to take a look in the mirror and recognize those things about ourselves in particular instances, because I think very few of us would ever find ourselves always one way all the time in every situation. I think we would often find ourselves that in this particular case, I'm probably playing more the role of the skeptic and I'm just fairly convinced that's a dumb idea, guys. It's a horrible idea. It's never going to work. I don't know why you're wasting your time, my time, and everybody else's time. Because I'm fairly convinced I'm right. And those of us who are good soloists, this is a very comfortable place of adversary for us to live because I know what's right. I'm the soloist. And so the very thing that motivates me to be a soloist is also the very thing that can lead me to be a skeptic. And skeptics, and we're going to talk about this a little bit later, that part of experiencing something greater is that it requires more than my effort and more than what I have. It's really easy to play the skeptic because I got no skin in the game. That's right. That's right. I can lob shots all day long and tell you how it's not going to work and tell you 12 ways you're going to fail because at the end of the day, I'm not trying. Exactly. Exactly. And as you can tell me parking on this one, that's been me from time to time. And that's an uncomfortable place to be is to sit in that place of pride and judgment and go, I know what's right. And so that, again, that's the heart where that this is coming from is we are at our best when we're willing to submit to a mirror that Jesus holds up in front of us and says, let me help you see yourself clearly because I have more for you. And in some cases we'll miss out on that if we don't see ourselves clearly because the predators think they are choosing the right use for resources. The skeptics think they are making the right arguments for future planning. The critics think that their way is legitimately better and the consumers are like, man, I'm just going to get the best of both worlds out of this. And so be willing to, to again, pause because the goal of this podcast in particular podcast in particular is ask God made it 27 minutes into this thing without actually saying the words yet. I'm not sure how Brian would feel about that. He usually sneaks it in earlier. The goal is ask God. The goal is not to necessarily sit there and self-diagnose and self-analyze. The goal is ask God. And again, it's sometimes situational. And so ask God, is there a particular moment in your life that you're feeling the tension of this story with Nehemiah of something greater and maybe you feel like you're on the inside of it and maybe you feel like you're on the outside of it. Ask God, what role am I trying to play in this right now? And would you show me with clarity what's really happening? So if you need to hit pause there for a little bit and just sit with that again, we'll be here. It's the beauty of digital. I love it. I can still go home and still be here. So Lee, in the second part of the message, you were talking about something greater requires something more than my effort that everyone has to collaborate with each other, particularly around a central vision. And you said something here that I found just, again, it gripped me. And so I'm just going to read it verbatim if you're all right with that. Awesome. So Lee, you said the central vision to which we as a church have been called is helping people experience Jesus as Lord of their life. And then you said this, beware of settling for Jesus insurance, that he's just there to fix your problems when life falls apart. We are seeking to help people experience a fully surrendered to Jesus life. And that's the call. And that can't be done by one person. It can't be done by a lead pastor. It can't be done by two pastors that frequently share the stage. This isn't a one man show. It's not a two man show. It's not a three person show or a four person show. This is a central vision for a collaborative effort for a body of people. And so I know this is obviously big on your heart and big in the message. And so just talk about that in context about that in particular, this central vision requiring more than just one person's effort. What does that look like to actually collaborate around a vision like that? Well, yeah, I'm glad you picked up on the Jesus insurance piece because the, you know, I think that the easy thing for us to do as followers of Jesus, you know, particularly when there's a passionate appeal for us to get involved in ministry is to become insurance salesmen, you know, whether it's fire insurance for eternity or, you know, auto insurance to recover your wrecked automobile, your wrecked life kind of thing, or homeowner's insurance because, you know, flood damage, whatever it is, but we, you know, we, that's what we do. And we think when people say, yes, I want the insurance policy, then we've done our job. Yeah. You know, I always go back to that last set of this, the last three verses of the book of Matthew. And it's the last moment Jesus has, or the last moment Matthew tells that Jesus has with his disciples. And he says to them, you know, in classic King James version, go therefore into all the world and make disciples. More modern language says, you know, go make disciples. The actual translation, the original language says, as you are going, make disciples. And then he qualifies what a disciple is, teaching them to obey everything I've commanded you. So basically what Jesus says is, look, you've had three and a half years, ride up close and personal with me and go give them that same experience. And in the same way that you're sitting here on the side of this mountain saying, I will die for you, you know, because some of them had said that in the couple of months prior, I will die for you. I'll go to the ends of the earth for you. I'll, you know, in the same way that you're sitting here saying you have everything, Jesus, that's what you're leading people to. And so the vision of the church and certainly the vision of our church, I mean, the vision of our church is that we want to disciple people to experience Jesus as Lord. That's how we state it. The vision of the church universal is to make disciples, which is not people who know how to get divine intervention for the crises of their lives, but they're people who live in a new kingdom. And I was thinking about that and time and the message didn't allow for me to build it out, but you know, for a kingdom to be a kingdom, it has to have a king and in a kingdom as opposed to a democracy and a kingdom, what the king wants, the king has the kingdom looks and feels and operates the way the king wants, you know, and we don't take a vote on that. You know, democracy, that's a different story, but, but in a kingdom, it's a different deal. It is the will and way of the king. And Jesus came to establish the kingdom of God. And in order to establish the kingdom of God, that means that the way of God has to be the way of the kingdom. And so if we're going to really experience what God has for us, we're going to lead people to like ourselves, be fully surrendered to Jesus and say, your will, your way, it's your kingdom. Yeah. And, and I am blessed to be a part of your kingdom. And therefore press your wants, desires and ways on me. And, and I wonder sometimes, even in my own life, as I'm assessing Lee, I wonder sometimes if the problem is not so much that I'm a great insurance salesman, but it's that I personally have areas of my life that I'm resistant to a king. And therefore I'm not going to sell the kingdom. I'm not going to promote the kingdom. I'm not going to lead somebody to the kingdom because I'm not a part of it, you know? And so I think it's really important that we be cautious and be aware that we could sell Jesus insurance as opposed to helping establish a kingdom. Absolutely. Yeah. One of the things that I see so often come up when we do our encounter conferences or we teach our Wednesday night class called following God's voice, or we have people come in for prayer sessions is that in a lot of cases, people are looking for freedom from something. Right. And they believe that Jesus can do that for them, which he can, but it's, I don't want to be this way. I don't want to have this thing. I don't want to have to deal with this problem, with this issue, with this concern. I want Jesus to make my path straight. I want comfort. I want reliability. I want predictability. I want dependability. I want a problem free life. And what's so interesting to me is that that's not Jesus's primary concern. It's not that he can't do that. It's not that he doesn't sometimes give incredibly extravagant gifts for no particular reason at all, or sometimes just because we ask. But that's not the primary goal of making our paths straight. Making our paths straight is because we're going somewhere and he wants us to get there. And not like a hurry up and get there, not like a get it together, but because where we're going is so unbelievably amazing that he doesn't want us to miss out on it. Years ago, I was in a collection of pastors and we were talking about preaching and the nature of our preaching and how we should construct sermons and those kinds of things. And this phrase came up in our conversation that I have kind of held on to. And that is this, instead of preaching against something, preach for something. Because the reality is, like in the I want to be free from, we've set up all the bad things that we're against. I'm against this, I want to be free from this, rather than I am drawn away from this because of the beauty of Jesus. And I am for Jesus and I want, as Jesus describes, the abundant, overflowing life in John 10.10 when he talks about that. And so there's a real difference in living there. I'm, for lack of a better way to say it, instead of calling Jesus for roadside assistance, I'm actually on the highway headed there with him. And not, oh, I'm in a bind, come pick me up. And I think there's a beautiful reality of our life, even though it's filled with risk, filled with challenge, and even filled with adversaries, opponents, there's a beautiful life when we are a part of the kingdom and following the king. And that was Jesus' invitation coming out of the wilderness, was repent. And that's not clean yourself up, get yourself together, that's think differently. Well, and think about that call. So Jesus comes out of the wilderness, says repent, and think of how he invited the disciples. He didn't say, come forward and repent. He said, come follow me. I'm going to change your life by taking you this way. Because the kingdom is here, the kingdom is at hand, the kingdom is all around you. That's why I want you to follow me. That's why I want you to think differently about all the things you've ever thought of, is because there's a fundamentally different reality. There is a kingdom here. There is a way of life. There's a place we're going. And I want to show you that. That's the invitation. There's this verse in Romans 4 that just, I don't know, it encourages me. It's not even a sufficient enough word. It excites me. There's anticipation around this. And Romans 4, that section is talking about the life that Abraham has with God and the promises of God that were given to Abraham and through Abraham. And verse 17 of Romans 4 says, Abraham believed in the God who brings the dead back to life and who creates new things out of nothing. That's who God is. It's not the God that gets rid of the bad stuff. It's not the God that makes the path straight so we're comfortable. It's the God who brings dead things and dead people. People that were dead to life. And creates new things out of nothing. It's not the freedom from. It's not the preaching against. It's the freedom to become. It's the you get to have. You get to have this life with God that is exponentially better than anything else you could ever possibly imagine or have or ask for. I mean, it's the way Brian closes most every service, right? That there is a God who is able to do exceedingly more abundantly more than all we could ever ask for or imagine. That's where we're going and that's who we're going with. I love when we get around Easter and we don't talk about it a lot because it's a kind of a problematic part of the Easter story. But when Jesus on the cross, one of the gospel writers, when Jesus on the cross breathes his last breath and he dies, it says that immediately the tombs broke open and those who were dead got up and walked around. God gives life everywhere. We call it the kingdom of God and we could just as easily call it the kingdom of life. This kingdom we live in, this world we live in is controlled by death. That is absolutely true. And if we chase anything other than Jesus, we are chasing death. But God has life in his touch. And there's something beautiful about that. And that is both literal, as in the tombs break forth and the dead walk around. But it's also figurative. My life feels empty. My life feels hopeless. My life feels like a dead end. I'm going through the mundane. Maybe it's not pain, maybe it's not conflict, maybe it's just the mundane. Is this all there is? I get up in the morning, I fix a little coffee, I go to work, take a lunch break, work a little more, come home, have a hamburger, watch a little TV and go to bed. There's got to be more than that. There's got to be more than this. And so maybe that's all it is. I mean, maybe that's the routine that you're dealing with and it's mundane. Jesus came to give us life, abundant life. And there's something beautiful and compelling about that. We could probably just stop there, but there's more. But wait. But wait. So Lee, as we get to the third and final part of this, the last thing you talked about was in this life with God where there is the promise of an abundant life, an extravagant life, and we're invited into something greater that cannot be done on our own and cannot even be done with just us and God. It also requires more than I have. So we talked about it's more than just me. It takes others. It's more than just my effort. It requires collaboration, requires more than I have. That success is dependent on sacrificial investment from everyone. And you talked about a couple of ways in which the people in the story of Nehemiah responded. And when they were talking about rebuilding the wall that you pointed out that some said, I'll take this area because I have a reason, and my reason is I have the skills and the gifting to engage in this collaborative endeavor around a central vision. I know how I can help here. I'm on board. And you pointed out that some people said, I'll take this area because I have an affinity with this particular place or the people in that particular place. Because essentially it was, that's my neighborhood. That's my part of Jerusalem. I am incredibly passionate about making sure the wall here is in good shape because it backs up to my house. And then there were some people that just seemed to say, I don't necessarily have the skills, the gifting or a claim on any particular area, but I'm in and I'm ready to help. And so show me where to go. And so highlight a little bit about what that was meaning to you in this place of this is going to require more than just I have. So if you're watching the podcast before you listen to the message and you get to this point in the podcast, you might hear us talking about more than I have and a great investment and think, oh, this was a sermon about money. And I'm not even talking about money. I'm talking about the internal limitations that we place on our experience with God. And one of the things I love about this, and John, you know, I teach that class and I'm going to share this. If you watch the message, you've heard me share in the very beginning, but I teach the class, read the Bible for life. And every time I teach that class, you know, one of the opening things we do is I ask the question, why is the Bible so hard to read? And inevitably somebody says in every one of the sessions, because of the genealogies, right. And so I began to get, well, when you turn the page to Nehemiah chapter three, if you're just kind of reading through it, that's how it feels like it's a genealogy. And, you know, as I thought about the message, you know, I always respond and say, you know, the genealogies are really powerful because they tell us something. And so I went into the study of the message going, okay, I want to see what's all here. And here's the fair answer. I listed for my wife last night, five different sermons I could have preached from that class by the time I got done reading it because it's so rich or such good stuff. So one of the things that just jumped off the page at me was here are like, if you go through the list and it feels like a genealogy, so, so-and-so's doing, so-and-so's doing, so-and-so's doing, so-and-so's doing. There are a handful of things that are there that if you're not careful, you'll miss. One, so-and-so did this because it was right at his house. So-and-so did this, but he was a goldsmith or a manufacturer of perfume. And so, you know, here's the guy that says, look, I'm going to be involved because this is my neighborhood and this is about vitality for myself, my family, and my neighbors. So this is about this. There's another guy that says, you know, I'm going to do this. I'm going to be involved in this thing that God's asking, but I'm not bringing anything. I mean, the, so the perfume manufacturer, when you read that was the, some, some translations call it the apothecary. They were the pharmacists, right? So here's the pharmacist going, what do I know about building walls? You know what I mean? I'm a pharmacist for heaven's sakes, you know, but, but he's one of those guys that shows up and says, I don't know what I can bring, but I want to bring something. So tell me where you need me. I'm available. And, and so I, you know, I look at some things like that and I'm reminded of this, that God's not interested or interest is not the right word. God's not concerned with our competency. He's concerned with our availability. And I, I wonder how many times we miss something greater because we go, God, I'd really like to see that, but I can't, I am not skilled at that. I don't know how to do that. I hear that often when I'll say to people, Hey, can you share with this group, your story of how you came to know Jesus? And they go, Oh, I'm so sorry. I can't do that. I don't, you know, because I don't know all the verses or I don't know all the theological, you know, I don't, I can't, you know, and, and here's what I can't do. Rather than saying, here's what God can do. And what you see in this story is what winds up being an army of people. Experts say there were more than 50,000 people who were a part of this massive project that was accomplished in epic time, 52 days, you wind up with a group of people who are, none of them for the most part are tradesmen at building, but they are available to the God who constructs life because that wall represented life and vitality. And so they said yes to God. Here's what I have. My hands are open. I don't see any value in this. I don't know how this works. And God goes, I do. And he does that for us. I can't tell you how many times that happens in my own life where I go, I'm not capable, even down to places where I feel kind of competent, which this podcast started off air before we started the camera. When I got done writing this message, I, I sat down after I'd sent the email. Cause we have a rhythm where we send the email to different parties, uh, on staff. I sent the email because the deadline was there and I sat down with my wife and I said, you know, I think I know the content, but I don't think this is a very good message. 24 hours later, John's emailing me and his email in the subject line goes, I love this message. And I, I'm always fascinated by, okay, Lord, I'm going to just show up because I don't think this is particularly good. I don't think I'm particularly gifted at this. I don't think that I don't know how to do this. And God does something that I have no way of anticipating. And that is the great investment. That's when I'm leaning into this more than I have, I'm leaning into the idea that I'm saying to God, you have all of me, but I don't think it's very good. But however you want to do it, I'll take that step. So God, if you're asking me to step into something, I'm not going to let my insecurity about my competency be the reason to say no. And I just, I mean, I probably just preached the whole sermon right there, but it's worth hearing, but that's my, that's where I was leaning in. And that's, I mean, as I read the text, I just thought, I mean, this is glaring here that God takes 50,000 just average people and restores vitality and prominence to this city that, that we know is the city of God. And, and he does it through goldsmiths and perfume makers and priests and temple servants and just all kinds of various people who say I'm available. And again, we look at the beauty of those groups and the way that they must have had to interact that the few people that were skilled, you can't do the walls of Jerusalem by yourself. I don't care how good you are. The soloist route is not available unless you're going to get like 500 years of life, which you're not going to get, but you do have to be willing, not only to use your skills, but to invest your skills in the task and the people, right? There is a level of, all right, I got people next to me that don't know what they're doing and I can't teach them everything I know, but I can give them something and then there's the people that just have the passion, but man, that passion matters because sometimes the skilled trades person doesn't have the passion for the place, but you do, you do. And that passion will change the construction or the creation of whatever the thing is. And then the people that just show up and say, I'm here and I'm not sure what I can do, oftentimes turn out to be far more capable, far more gifted and become passionate. Not only about the how, not only about the task, but about the where or about the who. God will do exponentially more through the available than he will through the talented. And, and sometimes we confuse those things. In fact, I at times ache in my soul at the way that the Western church has seemed to point at the talented and, and forgotten that we are the people who follow the God of the available and he uses a stutterer to set his people free. He uses a shepherd boy with limited life experience to slay giants. He uses an atheist to write half of the new Testament. I mean, God has always been the God of the available and he does exponentially more through the available than he does to the talented. And, and just leaning back into a previous point, you were talking about this, the collaboration piece. I love that this story is around building a wall and the metaphor runs deep, you know? So, so here are 42 people or 42 groups of people working on 42 sections of this wall to build a wall that has vitality and strength and usefulness and effectiveness. They have to collaborate with each other. They have choice. They don't have a choice and you can't make the wall connect without collaboration. Yeah. So, so it, I mean, the thread of together is just woven into the metaphor in such, such deep, deep, profound ways. Yeah. And so there's, there's something that each of those groups had to learn, right? The skilled trades people in some cases probably had to learn how to collaborate or learn how to collaborate with, with people that weren't skilled trades people, right? The people that were passionate about the place probably had some, some skill and technique to learn. And the people that were just available had to learn about the place and the sky. Right. But here's the thing for me as someone who is as passionate as you are about discipleship, you open up your message with some of the analogies from your life about sports and the kind of player you were. And the invitation to all of us in this idea of spectator and soloist is no, nobody is invited to sit in the stands and watch this game. Yeah. We're all invited to play. And sometimes we spend so much time learning about the game. Yeah. Learning the rule book as a friend of mine has sort of taught this parable of a soccer game that the goal is to get you on the field. The goal is not to produce better fans. It's not to produce better referees and announcers and broadcasters. It's not even necessarily to produce better coaches. The goal is to produce players and that's the invitation here, right? This is 50,000 people that are doing, 50,000 people that are playing the game. They're not watching the game, they're playing the game and they get to participate and they get to experience something greater. And then here's the other piece that I have to be reminded of is the invitation as well is there are times to support and times to initiate, right? There are times to say, follow me, here's where we're going. There are times to say, okay, I'm following, let's do it. And that's not a lifetime role, right? That's a situational role in many cases. And one of the things that, that breaks my heart about this is that much like you were talking about the Western church and the, and the way that we've sometimes elevated talent, I think we've sometimes also elevated the church is that the physical church is the place that you have to come to for something greater to be done. And, and I love it when people say, you know, I feel like you guys do good stuff at your church. I want to bring my friends. I want to have them, you know, listen to this message. I want to bring my friends and have them take this class or go to this conference. And there's a part of me that, like that, that feels good. Yeah. Right. That, that means we're doing something helpful. We're doing something useful, but at the same time, there's a part of me that feels like, do you feel like you don't know how to go to them and give that right. Right. Have we missed that part? Right. Have we missed that part of the equipping of you can do this. You don't have to bring them here. Yeah. You can go there. God's not selling tickets to the kingdom. No. And sometimes we set it up like he is like, Oh, I just need to buy a ticket. Yeah. Yeah. I got my seat, but God's not selling tickets to the kingdom. You know, you, you, he's enlisting members of his army and, and that will never fail to be a powerful analogy to me. And he is not pointing us to an organization. He's pointing us to a relationship. And that relationship, what I, what I love about the incarnation of Jesus and then the application of the Holy spirit into our lives is that relationship is anywhere and everywhere it is. And, and so it's not geo-tagged and, uh, uh, God invites us to step into something greater and to step into something greater with others, dependent upon others through collaborative relationship and by taking that step of faith into something that's bigger than me. Yeah. And, and when we live that place, there's something really powerful about that kind of life. There is. And you finished your message with some version of this reality being expressed. Cause again, it's Wednesday. Who knows that this life that God invites us into, it requires our investment beyond our comfort. It takes us to a place of dependency. A place takes us to a place of discomfort. It takes us to a place of cost. Yeah. It will cost. And you said a more than life lived for something greater will cost you everything. It will. And that is a terrifying prospect. And at the same time, maybe one of the most exhilarating things ever, because if it costs you everything, well, Jesus promises it's worth it. Right. Right. He told the rich young ruler that had everything. If you want more, if you want something greater, here's the deal. Give up all the things that you think are going to give you something greater and come follow me and I'll show you. He tells the parables of the treasure buried in the field and the pearl of great price. And he tells the parable of the person that models that obedience and that trust of there is something here worth everything. This isn't a casual thing. This isn't a hobby thing. This isn't a Sunday thing. This is. This is life. Yeah. This is life. And Jesus says it about as clearly as he says most anything when in, because this is all in Matthew, but 1625, he says, he that seeks to save his life will lose it. But he that gives up his life. Yeah. We'll find life. Yeah. And that's the invitation. That's what, like you said, he's not selling tickets to the game. He's not selling tickets to the kingdom. He's inviting every single one of us into life. Yeah. And he's made it really clear. You can't experience life by holding on to other stuff. You have to, you have to let go and let me. Yeah. And, and you're right. Terrifying and exhilarating all at once. But something greater is found when we step off the edge of the cliff and experience what God has, but I got to let go. Yeah. Yeah. So on that note, we're going to call this good. And so again, as you end, I know sometimes the temptation is to pop out earlier, jump to the next podcast or whatever, but sit with that for a little bit and ask God what he's specifically inviting you into. That is greater than what you can do alone, greater than what you can do without collaboration, greater than what you can do with your skills and your abilities and your giftings. And then specifically ask him about the abundant life, this thing that he's straightening your path to lead you to ask him what that looks like. Even if it just feels like it's the middle of the mundane and there has to be more than this, ask him about it because he'll start to tell you. Yeah. He'll start to show you and it's worth it. It's worth everything. I'm convinced John, as we wrapped this up, that every single human being was made for something greater. Yeah. And that's why every single human being longs for something greater. And the fundamental root of the fall is that we settled for something less. Yeah. And we are spending our life trying to find the remedy to the less than. Yeah. And Jesus invites us to be set free from that plague and experience something greater. Yeah. That's well said. So friends, as always, thanks for being with us in this journey. We're so grateful to have you on this journey. So until next time, on behalf of Lee, thanks for being here, my friend. Thank you for having me. I love it. Yeah. We'll see you all next time.
