Welcome back to the Faith Forward Podcast, John Ackerman, Brian Bales, Happy New Year. A little bit late. We weren't able to get in the studio last week, so we're going to double up today. We're going to wear the same outfit for two episodes, one for last week's message and one for this week's message. I love how you set that up, like somehow I wouldn't at least wear the same outfit two weeks in a row anyway. I will say this, that I have some favorite things that I wear, not because I like what they look like. They're just comfortable. And I have been known to, especially around the podcast, and if you happen to attend Christian Fellowship Church on the weekend, this is where this podcast, Faith Forward, comes from, Christian Fellowship Church in Ashburn, I've been known to go back to our online services and look at what I wore. Because there's sometimes I thought to myself, oh, I'm just going to wear this week. And I get back, I'm like, oh, I wore that in two weeks. Now I won't remember. I know that. I won't remember. But somebody else will. Somebody else will. But so yeah, welcome back a little bit like later than we thought. But in today's even still a little bit different than how we thought. But you know, hey, new year, new us, we'll try to be flexible. I can sort of touch my toes. That's a good marker. Yeah. So we're going to start off by taking last week's episode a step further. And so we've started this new series called Giveaway People. We're going to be here for a few weeks. And so last week, Brian, the fun part for me was I then got to write some of the podcast notes after the fact. Sure. Hearing your message, which we don't usually get to do. We're usually guessing at what's probably going to happen ahead of time. But if you would sort of take us back through last Sunday's message, and then we'll dig in a little bit to the practical steps as we always try to do here. And so there were some aspects about what I was talking about on Sunday from Luke chapter 10, that was very unique to our congregation. So if you're listening to this, some of it was very unique to us who call Christian Fellowship Church our church home. But it still applies to everybody. And the question really was for us is what's next? What's our next chapter as a church? And part of this series that actually I've called the next chapter sub part, the first three is Giveaway People, is we get a question a lot. I think we all do like, what is God doing next? What is God doing next? What is God doing next? And a lot of times when that question is asked, it is a very good question. But we often have a tendency to focus around what I would like to say the buildings or programs, which by the way, are very good. What I was using an illustration on that Sunday was if you think of an axe throwing set, the building is a bullseye. You know, you can't throw an axe without throwing a bullseye, at least you shouldn't. The programs are often the axe, but you're not really axe throwing unless people throw the axe. And one of the things that we're very much focused on here in the year 2024 at Christian Fellowship Church is making sure that we are doing the work of the gospel that God has allowed us to do using the tools like a building and a location and programs for what they are. And so what we said is really what's next for us is that we need to be giveaway people. We talked a little bit about this in the fall. If you're a longtime video slash podcast watcher or listener, when we talked about retuning and we're going deeper into this idea of being giveaway people, and this is a premise. Luke chapter 10, Jesus said, the son of man, he's talking about himself. It came not to be served, but to serve. Then he goes on. And later on, we went in and looked at Philippians chapter two and said, our call as people is to have this mind be you that isn't Christ Jesus. So to live like Jesus. So the point is, is that we are to be like Jesus, who was a giveaway person who came to give his life as a ransom for many. So with that reminder, last Sunday, we just asked this question, who is worthy of giving our life away to? Because sometimes if we are self-aware and truthful, there are people in our life that we don't feel are worthy of giving our life away to. But everyone, that's the answer. Everyone is worthy of giving their life away to. And what Jesus did is he told a parable, a parable that I think most all of us know, whether or not you're listening to this and have a Christian background or not, you're familiar with the term, the good Samaritan. And in telling this, he was setting up this idea that we're to love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and love your neighbors yourself. And the teacher of the law who was trying to catch him had asked Jesus a question, well, who is my neighbor looking for the loophole? And he tells him about the Samaritan, the story of the good Samaritan, which I'm not going to retell. You can go read it yourself. You most likely know it. But the point of Jesus telling the story wasn't answering the question, who is my neighbor, as much as am I being a good neighbor? Am I being a giveaway person? Everyone is worthy of giving their life to. And in this case, he was talking about the Samaritan saying he was living it out better than the Jewish person was, the Levite or the priest in the story. And so we began to grapple a little bit around that and we'll continue to grapple with it because as you said, we're going to do two weeks. We're right before the next series or the next talk in this series. And this Sunday coming up, which you're listening to after we've done it, digs deeper into Matthew chapter 22, which is called the Shema, comes from Deuteronomy chapter six and part of Leviticus chapter 19 that is quoted in Luke as well in that way. So you know what? Do I keep saying Luke? I mean, Mark, I'm sorry. No, Luke. No, Luke. So good night. Hold on a second. That's a good question. I put my coffee over there today and it's not going so well for me already. It's been a crazy morning. So thanks for the grace. That's all right. So there you go. All right. So that's the setup. Yep. And while we're confessing things, we're down one camera today. So if I'm staring off into space at some point, I promise I'm not going anywhere that I'm not supposed to. It's just, I'm used to looking over here at a camera and there's no camera there today. So we're going to get through this together. You know, these are definitely Loudoun County, Virginia problems. I'm pretty sure that people in other parts of the world are like, yeah. So you have two cameras. Yeah. You poor podcasters. Yeah. Right there. That's a problem. There you go. So as we always want to do on this podcast is make things practical, right? How, how do we go about doing this or if we're doing it, how do we, how do we get a sense of are we heading in the right direction? And so the answer is always the second name of this podcast, ask God. That's right. As we go along the way, it's helpful sometimes to have questions or categories to take to God, different ways of thinking about it. And so here, one of the things that Jesus draws people's attention to in this parable is that this isn't just informational understanding about who's my neighbor. This is application. This is experiential knowledge of go and do these things. Yeah. Because when he says go and do likewise in that section of scripture, I expounded on a little bit on that Sunday was that understanding in the original language. That was a command and an ongoing command when it's in the present tense. It doesn't mean just go love that person once, right? It means it's a command to go love and continue to love. And I think for some of us, we might be able to easier get ourselves to the point where like, if I have to love that Samaritan, my life one time, I can muscle up and do it. But Oh, I mean, we can really do it well without the Holy spirit. The first time we can no way, shape or form do it likewise, continue it without his help. Yeah. And that really is the lifestyle that Jesus invites us into not, not the singular act. And so one of the questions that came up as I was putting these notes together was how do I know if I'm doing this loving people and serving people thing, right? Once I've entered into this lifestyle or maybe pushed into this lifestyle a little bit further than I had before, what are some metrics? What are some markers that I can use in my conversations with God to get a handle on, are we going in the right direction? And so one of the first ones that came up as I was thinking about this is that if you've been trying to love your neighbors, plural, not just one neighbors, well, for a while, there probably is this, this question of, is this, is this working? Is this helpful? Is this, is this right? And the first marker that came up was, has disruption and inconvenience become comfortable or maybe more comfortable is a, is a more fair way of saying that. And I think more is a very important modifier, not to try to be English boy in this, but comfortable is a relative term. So there's some people who are naturally more comfortable with inconvenience and disruption than other people. And so it's about being more comfortable. And the other thing is, is that for some people, inconvenience and disruption actually means not living in chaos, not jumping around because the intent we can think, oh, inconvenience and disruption always means chaos for those of us who like security, like me, that's what it means. But there are some people who thrive in that. And so for them being uncomfortable is sticking and staying with that neighbor, not jumping to the new thing and try to find some other other person I can serve. And so what in this, it has disruption, inconvenience become more comfortable as a phenomenal diagnostic question, but you also still have to know how God's made you and naturally, because it's relative. As I was thinking about that, because I've got a friend I'm thinking of right now in my mind who, to me, their life is chaos all the time and it makes me unbelievably uncomfortable. And I'm not using chaos negatively in this occasion, even though lots of times I do. But for them, it just doesn't seem to be that way. They don't have that stress at all. Then the challenge would be to stick and stay. Like if you ask this person to be a pastor of a church for 20 years, they would lose their minds. Like I can't be in a place for 20 minutes. But then there are some people who are like, oh, if God asked you to move every like 20 minutes, would you do it? And I'm like, no, no, I need that security. So first, the first podcast of the year, I'm going to be squirreling. You already warned me pre-podcast about you squirreling and I've squirreled and we're only eight, nine minutes into the podcast. It's all good. And so part of the challenge is that, is that this is a topic that I think has been so covered and, and so addressed in most people's lives that this isn't the first time they're hearing about it. This is maybe the 30th time they're hearing about it. And so there's already so many, so many parameters already set in the way that they think about how I should and should not love my neighbor, how I should and should not serve my neighbor. And so this, this question of has disruption and inconvenience become more comfortable? Like you said, for some people, disruption and inconvenience in their schedule is already a place that's so disrupted and inconvenienced already. It's like, what's a little bit more, bring it on, I'm comfortable. And so this isn't about narrowing the focus. It's actually about expanding our willingness to be disrupted and made uncomfortable in more places. And so maybe in your schedule, chaos reigns supreme already. And so an extra 30 minutes here or there, or a 45 minute side trip, or we were joking about this right before we hit record, text messages that come in in the evening from people and you sort of grit your teeth and bear it, but it's become such a customary act that it's easier to grit your teeth and bear it and be mostly loving in the midst of it. So what about disruption and inconvenience in your resources? Not just the resource of your time, but your tangible resources, you know, for some people, I would much rather give my money than my time. For other people, I will give my time 10 times out of 10, but don't you dare ask for my stuff. And Jesus's invitation through this parable, I think is really interesting in that he's hitting on a lot of the places where we avoid disruption and inconvenience. This person that comes along is disrupted in his plan. He had a place to go, he was on his way somewhere, right? Was disrupted in the time that it took to stop and care for someone and then take them out of the way to a place to recover. And then was disrupted in the resources that they allocated to their recovery. And then, and we'll talk about this later, offered to come back and check on. Yeah, and I think something I didn't dig in on Sunday, but just for context, when you look in, and depending on what version you look in, it says it gives two denarii for the person. And if you don't really quite know what that is, the best way to describe is a denarii represented roughly one day's wages. And so imagine, you know, you work five days a week, whatever you take, whatever you make, two of those, all of a sudden you're just giving to a stranger that you don't know that is going to. And you said, by the way, what other expenses bill me for it? Yeah. Who knows what that's like? It'd be like dropping one of my, be like, be like dropping my 17 year old daughter off at Ulta or Sephora and going, well, just send me the bill when it's done. That's a dangerous thing I don't do. But we don't know what this person could have done with this innkeeper. Again, part of the challenge of this, we don't know if it's a parable or a real story, but either way, the purpose is driving home. They were willing to sacrifice. And it wasn't about a time quota. Even it was there. It wasn't even about a money particular thing. It was about how, in what areas are you willing to be a giveaway person? Am I being a good neighbor? Yeah. And so as we finish up this section and move on to some other ways to practically gauge how we're doing with this, I came across this, I still have to call it a tweet because they haven't given us a better name for it yet on a platform called X that used to be called Twitter. Sweet. I don't know what you do with that. But I came across this tweet from Beth Moore. And she said this, whatever the Lord's will for each of us in 2024 who follow Jesus, it will exceed our natural strengths, our natural skills, our talents, our levels of experience, our areas of expertise, our intellectual acumen, our worldly wisdom. The beautiful way that Jesus set this faith thing up is that we can't serve Jesus without Jesus. And I think as we look at this parable that Jesus is telling, it's implicit, but we almost have to make it explicit that the invitation was not love your neighbor within your means and within your comforts. It's love your neighbor as I call you to love your neighbor, love your neighbor as I invite you to love your neighbor. And that's not, and we're talking about this in a second too, that's not as a process, that's not as a program, that's not as a checkbox list of this is how you always love someone every single time, but it's dynamically and personally and uniquely through the guidance of his spirit in us, we were never meant to love our neighbor without Jesus. And so that means that we're meant to be made uncomfortable. We're meant to be stretched. We're meant to be grown through the process of loving our neighbor. We've talked about this before over the last year, that loving others and serving others is only ever about half about them. The other half is about us, our growth and development and becoming who God says we are. We were never meant to be able to do that without Jesus. So we're not going to get into the part where there is the threat of squirrelage all over the place. So this next category, squirrelage, uh, yeah, there you go. We, yeah, we can document that one. Yeah. That's for, that's, I'm going to call Webster after we get done here. Exactly. So the next place to talk about this as we're gauging, am I doing this in a way that's helping me to grow and helping others is avoiding extremes. And so we're gonna look at this from both ends that inaction with a good heart is still inaction and we are called to go and do likewise. But then at the other end of this spectrum, there is just as much danger in over-functioning with a good heart because that's still over-functioning. So let's start with the inaction side. Hey, my thoughts and prayers are with you, John. Yes. And I'm being somewhat facetious in saying that, but I think especially if you're in a Christian culture, not only is that something that we say, it's almost, we feel obligated to say, and it's almost in some ways become sort of a salutation to a conversation instead of an actual action that we're taking, you know, and, and so I, for my pastor, I'm a human being, I'm a follower of Jesus Christ saying, I'll pray for you is something I constantly do. I had to learn in my own life, like, all right, if I say that, I better be doing it. I'll do it. I'll do it right then. But then I'll make a note or I have to do something like that because it could turn into good intention. Yeah. Right. Because no one wants to hear, well, I'm not going to pray for you for that. Good luck. Yeah. We want that to happen. But there's some nuance that you talk about specifically as you lead our prayer ministries here at Christian Fellowship Church, as you pray with so many people that differentiate this idea that often we say thoughts and prayers versus actual when scripture calls us to pray for others. Right. I mean, it just, it got me thinking. And again, like you said, maybe this is just a story. Maybe this is something that actually happened, but either way, the way that Jesus is telling this parable, two people walk by before the Samaritan gets there and he indicates that both of them sort of moved away, intentionally created space and distance, but it got me thinking what if their response had been to walk past that person who's bleeding out on the ground and say, I'll pray for you as I continue on my way. Yeah. And it just got me thinking how often that's our response to people in crisis. And I'm not pointing fingers at anybody other than myself because I also want to point out this world is, and this isn't a commentary on the world today. This is a commentary on how the world has always been, right? There are always people hurting. There are always people in crisis. There are always people suffering. And if I said, and then actually followed through on praying for every person I saw in crisis, you would have to fire me because I would never come to work. Could you imagine the headline of that? John Ackerman, John Ackerman gets fired for praying too much. That would, that'd probably be some problems, right? Rich fires employee for too much prayer. Yeah. But it got me thinking about the level of intentionality that we have to have. And in my case, and again, pointing fingers nowhere other than at myself, there are times that I use, I'll pray for you as a cop out to get away from having to do anything more tangible. Or just because we don't know how to end the conversation, right? We don't know what to say because there are some things in life that are absolutely so paralyzingly awful and difficult that we go through this side of eternity that we don't know what to say. And so in trying to be a good neighbor, we say something well intentioned. That isn't really what we're doing, you know? And just as a side note, this is against first squirrel, uh, is if you find someone who's in that Samaritan, you know, the Samaritan finds a person in the ditch, right? Sort of moment, whether it's, you're in a metaphorical ditch because relationships or whatever it might be and, um, or health ditch, there's a list of them that can happen. It's okay to say, this is really awful. And I don't know how to help you, but I'll sit here with you. I will, I will love you as best as I know how, um, I will pray for you, but don't feel like you have to, or by the way, it's your responsibility to fix it. Even when God calls us into being a part of that person's life, we're still not the power. He's the power. We're the instrument. Yeah. And it also got me thinking as I was, as I'm listening to Jesus tell this story and so much of Jesus, his ministry was centered around. Praying for people to be healed. I thought it was interesting that the first few people that walk by, again, they could have said, I'll pray for you and carried on their way. That would have been very in keeping with the time, but they also could have stopped and prayed for that person to be healed in that moment. Like forget having to take them to an end. Let's just pray for these wounds to be healed, for you to get up and walk. And they didn't do that either. And it got me thinking about, all right, if I'm moving from inaction with a good heart into action, maybe the way that I pray for people needs to grow. Again, half of this is about the other person on the receiving end, but half of this is about me being made uncomfortable in places. And so am I being willing, am I willing to be made uncomfortable? Not just in my resources and not just in my time, but in my faith. Am I willing to step into a space where I change the way that I pray in order to love my neighbor? To not just pray remotely, to not just pray at a distance, but to pray with them, to sit with them in that space and go, I don't know what to do. And I don't know what to say. How about we pray together? And you know what? How about I come back again and we pray some more. And honestly, I don't know if my prayers are going to do anything right now, or at least if they're going to do the things that I want them to do or you want them to do. But what if we step into this uncomfortable space together? It got me thinking about being made uncomfortable, being disrupted in the ways that I typically am comfortable loving and serving others. And so as you're thinking about the places, because we all have them, where we're prone towards inaction with a good heart, again, you are not meant to save the whole world. You cannot save the whole world. But as you go along your way and you encounter people in need, are you willing to be made uncomfortable so that you can grow in some of these different places? And at the same time, the invitation is not to then swing to the other end and overfunction with a good heart. Yeah. If you have listened at all, the overfunctioning performance mentality is something that I myself and John know a little about, about the way that we want. And I want to say this about our heart disposition many times in the midst of this moment. Scripture says the heart is deceitful above all things who can know it. And I think one of the things that is really deceitful in me is the initial always reaction to perform, to fix something, to help someone. Because at first glance, right? It says, oh, well, that's a good thing. I'm performing, right? And so if you're that way, I'm not trying to tell you you're a horrible person, but I am trying to warn you that possibly your heart is deceitful in that moment. Because there are many times in retrospect, I'm doing that more to make myself feel better, or I'm doing that because I feel like this justifies my blank or my flesh. And that's going too far the other way in that way. And so, you know, you asked this question, do you know why you're doing the why that you're doing? Because there are times that God will have you do a certain thing, you know, and to just say, hey, I'm praying for you and that's it. Because and that fits into your more bent. But God says, do that. That's the why. Not because it's your bent. And then there's the opposite time where God may say, all right, time to roll up your sleeves. Let's get to work. Because he said, do that. Not because that is your natural bent. And that's the difference between trusting in our flesh and our way of doing it. And the second name of the podcast, asking God. So whether it's the inaction or it's the over functioning, right? Some of that, like you just said, it's the invitation to get curious about myself, right? Notice the places where I frequently don't help. When I drive, you know, my half hour back home every day, I notice how often I don't even think about if I see somebody pulled over on the side of the road, it's not even a thought for me to stop. And I know why some of that is, is because I am keenly aware of how little I know about vehicles. And so I am fairly confident, whatever they're pulled over for, I can't help with because I don't understand vehicles. And so often God's challenged me on that of what if it's got nothing to do with a mechanical issue, right? You are able to help people in any number of other ways. But I notice how often I'm predisposed to inserting my assessment of a situation and going, I've got nothing to offer there. That's for somebody else. So something just popped into my mind, right? Because if this is a parable, obviously there's one main point. Are you being a good neighbor, not a neighbor, but a question. So when you drive home in the 30 minutes, you drive the same way. Is it fairly common to see people on the side of the road? Yeah. Okay. So is there something about that scenario that when you see it on a consistent basis, that's numbing to you? Yeah. All right. So in context, right, this 21 mile road from Jerusalem to Jericho that dropped 3000 feet was called the way of blood. This person who was beat up and robbed, it was, it was like another car on the road. I'm not trying to be dismissive and saying a human being is like a car. But what I am saying is that probably is not the first time that Pharisee or that Levite saw or that priest rather that Levite saw someone on that side of the road. And I think that's something unique about what can happen in our lives when we can become numb to the circumstances around us instead of saying, God, what do you want me to do in these circumstances? Because when you see it a lot, um, we do become numb. We absolutely can become numb. And it just kind of struck me. It's not even something I ever thought about talking about in that way that you brought up. Like, I bet you see a lot of that. And the more that we tend to see about it, the, the tendency in my life is maybe not in yours, maybe not in yours. But the tendency of mine is the more I see something, the, the, there is a correlation between the amount of times I asked God, am I supposed to do something about that? Yeah. Right. And so again, as we swing to the other end, the goal isn't to, all right, well, I'm now going to stop for every single person that's pulled over on the side of the road. That's not the point either. The point is to become aware of the needs around me and to become aware of what God is doing in me as he's drawing my attention to that one, that one, you're, you're meant to help that one. And so we're going to nuance some of these with a couple of examples, but it's probably safe to say this, that if you see someone bleeding out on the side of the road and you're walking by five feet from them, stop, it doesn't matter if you're a medical professional or not stop and offer what you can. And I think there's where we start to find the balance between the over function and the inaction is stop and offer what you can. You cannot solve everyone's problems. And that's not the message that Jesus is conveying in this parable is you have to solve everyone's problems. His invitation is love your neighbor. All right, John. So let's sort of pick up on some nuance then, because again, I think there's some things that we can say fairly clear one is, is if you see someone and you recognize them as being in a real life ditch or metaphorical ditch, the spirit of wisdom from scripture is, is that loving means we at least got to step towards it. But there is this sort of moment just because we step towards something doesn't mean exactly that we know what to do when we're there. So not getting ahead of ourselves and creating the whole plan of what God wants us to do, but just understanding and taking our faith forward. The first step is to forwardly step into where it is. So we were just talking a second ago before this, where you, you, you often go to concerts that great. And if you've ever been to a Christian concert, you know, it's not uncommon that there's a break some point in there for the, uh, the artists, whoever it is to get some water, take a rest, whatever it might be. And in that break more times than not, in my experience, yours might be a little bit different. They don't just sort of like let everyone go and go, all right, everyone go to the bathroom and come back. Yeah. They, they use that time for something specific. A lot of times it does to, to give you an opportunity to respond to someone or for someone who's comparatively. Their life is a bit of a ditch and in that way, right? Yeah. Yeah. I feel like a bit like the does that. He's got, I don't always go to Christian concerts, but when I do, I feel compelled to sponsor a child. Yeah. Yeah. And, and yeah, it's that tension of artists. If you see, if you see someone bleeding out five feet from you, move towards them and do something. But as we now step into this place of nuance, my wife and I support three kids through various, you know, organizations like compassion or world vision. And every time we go to a Christian concert and they have that pitch in the middle of the event, there's that pull towards recognizing here's someone in need and we have a capacity to potentially help them. But here's where you have to find that balance between inaction and over-functioning right in action means I'm thankful for all the other people at that event that are sponsoring children so that I don't have to over-functioning is every time I go to an event, I sponsor a new child or 12 and suddenly I wake up and realize I need a sponsor, right? That's the tension. And so what we find ourselves doing is recognizing an opportunity for need and recognizing we need to ask God what to do in this moment. And so we find ourselves in that intermission time at these concerts going, God, would you have a support another child? And that's how we got to three in the first place. And so if you would like the Ackerman family to sponsor a child, just host a concert and in the middle of it, you know, give them an opportunity. Yes. Send me an email at faithforward.cfcyr.org. But and I know that in some ways that's, that's maybe an oversimplified example, but for me, it's a very practical one because I'm confronted with a need every time I go. And there is that part of me that wants to help. There's that part of me that goes, well, you know what? Maybe we just, maybe we eat less food so that they can eat more, right? There's always a way to justify without asking. There's always a way to legitimize without first checking with God. There's always a should that I can operate under in terms of process and program without engaging in dynamic relationship with God. And then I have to be stretched sometimes when we're in that space and we ask God and he's like, no, not this time. And there's a part of me that goes, what? What do you mean? No, I'm willing. And we don't always get the why and the why isn't always the point, but the point is the willingness and it's the willingness to engage in the conversation. And so I know that sometimes people feel like, well, you shouldn't have to ask God if there's somebody in need. And I seriously push back against that because you're not meant to solve everyone's problem. You are meant to love your neighbor. We were talking about this before we hit record as well. It's sometimes easier to love someone on the first encounter than on the 27th because by the 27th you have a much better understanding of who they are and how they are and why they are. And if the same crisis keeps coming up time and time again, it's a little bit easier to recognize this isn't actually my crisis. And you and I have both had this as people call for help and say, this is happening in my life. Can I meet with you right now? Can you disrupt your day, your schedule, your time with your family, your time with other people that have asked to see you? Because I need you right now. And so often we're willing to do that. And then there's times where we've come to realize this didn't just become a crisis. This has been building for a while and it's largely gone unaddressed. And so now that doesn't mean I'm totally inconsiderate. It doesn't mean that I don't love you, but it also means that part of me loving you means learning how to help you navigate recurring situations so that they stop recurring. The simplest version of this is if somebody is always asking me for money. The first time somebody comes and says, Hey, I really need some help. Can I have 20 bucks? I say, sure. I reach in my pocket and I take out 20 bucks and I hand it to them. But if they come back the next day and the next day and the next day, I was just talking with somebody recently who works with church organizations and they were talking about people that come to the church for financial assistance and they come to churches that have satellite campuses and they go to each satellite campus with the same request. And that's not to say they don't have a legitimate need, but it begs the question of, are we solving problems or are we loving people? And as any parent knows, loving your child doesn't always mean solving their problem in the way that they want you to. There are a lot of tensions in the stories that you just told. One that sticks out to me, and if you have stuck with our podcast for the last several seasons, I feel like it could be really easy for you to say, I don't even know why I listen. At some point their answer to everything is ask God, but that is the answer to everything. It is. I mean, there's some things in scripture you don't have to ask him. He's already said, thou shalt not murder. You don't have to ask him if that's okay, right? But I'm talking about an application of everyday living. That's why the Holy Spirit is in us to guide us, direct us, and help us. One of the tensions that I hear in the story that often comes in my mind is this, is the tyranny of what I can see versus the reality of what I can't see. And so for example, you mentioned time and you mentioned someone that all of a sudden this is in the ditch and their life's there. I always ask God, here's why I always ask God, because I'm an over-performer and John, you're absolutely right in what you alluded to. I spent many years going out into the ditches and that sort of thing, which is not a thing wrong with that, without realizing the seeds I was not planting in my own family. Long-term being at home at some of those was better so my kids don't get in a ditch later on than it was in that momentary thing. And I think we can struggle when we in our own flesh, we in our own wisdom can see if I do blank, I'm going to see the return on the help right there versus if I don't do blank and I do something over here and we don't know exactly where that's going, we will have a tendency to go do these certain things, but we need to constantly ask. And this is why I say that because some of you may go, number one, Brian, you didn't say that. Well, it's true. I probably didn't. Or number two, I can't do that. Well, it just floored me many years ago. It was such an obvious thing. I don't know why I didn't see it. Here's the truth. Jesus did not do everything. He in both his perfect humanity with perfect discernment and by his unwavering insight to people's lives or the power of the Holy Spirit that he used, knew every problem, knew everything, every scenario in the ditch, and he did not deal with everything. He didn't. And if there's anyone who possibly could have, the savior of the world might be the person But his model when he was here of living was to show us how to live. His purpose was that the life and life to the full. And so he was showing us how to live in that way. So there was some freedom that came over my life when I realized that Jesus did not attend every emergency he was invited to. Jesus did not, but he stepped forward into every moment doing what the Holy Spirit asked. And so for us is it is stepping forward when we see that, but again, stepping forward into it. And then as we step forward into this scenario, that means not avoiding it. If they call not avoiding with their engaging, that's what I mean by stepping forward, but not beginning to develop what we're supposed to do without some significant interaction with Jesus. Yeah. Yeah. Again, the goal is not to solve people's problems. The goal is to love people. And as you were sharing that the example that came to mind was Lazarus. There was a very obvious problem to solve. Yeah. John chapter 11. Jesus come and save your friends so he won't die. We know you can. And Jesus through his connection with his father recognizes that there's another and better way to love his neighbor than to solve the problem that they want him to solve. And so again, loving your neighbor does not mean that you have to meet the demands that others put on your life. So now we're short on time, but you cannot mention John chapter 11 without me hopping on him for one a second because it really is one of my two favorite sections in scripture. So what John was just referring to is that Mary and Martha sent to Jesus. Okay. And so you understand that from the time they sent and Lazarus died to the time Jesus showed up was about four days and it could have been actually two days had been there, but he didn't show up. Now, both Mary and Martha have this confession. Jesus, if you would have been here, he wouldn't have died. Like what in the world does that mean? Like if Jesus would have been there, Lazarus would have never died. What we need to understand from that context of scripture is that Jewish people believed that the soul hovered over the body for three days. By the way, that's one of the significance why Jesus was in the tomb for three days and that after three days, the soul would be so separated from the body that you can never come back. So Jesus waiting four days instead of in the two that could have happened, made it no doubt. Number one, who he was God in the flesh. And when you look at the context of John chapter 11, in the end, Lazarus does live, right? So he loved Lazarus. Mary and Martha get their brother back. He loves Mary and Martha. But what's unique is, is there's a group of people in that text who are mourners. And those mourners in Jewish society showed up professionally and his family to mourn. And when Jesus finally shows up, here's the thing. They say, if this person would have been here, the guy who did all these other healings, they were aware that he had done miracles. But when he raises Lazarus from the dead, then some of those who were aware they'd done other miracles now become believers. Here's the point. When Jesus waited four days, he knew that number one, all these good things are going to happen for Lazarus, Mary and Martha, but he had a greater purpose in the salvation of those people eternally who knew about him and knew he had done stuff, but hadn't moved on this, but did it this way. And that's a reminder of John chapter 11, that in that moment, Jesus, there was a ditch moment there. I mean, Lazarus, there can't be much more of a ditch than that. He's dead. Mary and Martha, his good friends are sad and mourning. But he's like, no, no, no. What does the spirit say? Ah, I've got a bigger plan. I got it. All right. So that was a squirrel, but you know. No, it's actually a great transition to the next thing because the next thing is, is our loving our neighbor and serving our neighbor forming genuine connection or is it just solving problems because Jesus also, as he did several times as reported in the gospels, healed from a distance. Right. So he could have healed Lazarus before he died in whatever way we wanted to find dying. Right. So he could have solved the problem from a distance and notice the emphasis that Jesus so often placed on. I don't just want to solve your problem. I want to make a connection. And so we need to ask ourselves that question is, has loving and serving form genuine connection? And we referenced this earlier that it's easier sometimes to give money than to establish connection, to give time in the moment, but not establish a connection, to be moved in a moment, but not establish a connection. And so I was really struck by going back to the parable that Jesus tells about the good Samaritan where he talks about the good Samaritan to the innkeeper saying, I will repay you when I come back, that this isn't a one-off. I didn't dump two days worth of wages and I hope that covers it. And if it doesn't, hopefully somebody else kind comes along. It's I'm coming back. I'm coming back to connect with you. I'm coming back hopefully to connect with him if he's still here and in need. And if not, right, he's coming back to a place where a moment has already occurred to create a second moment. And it just, it got me thinking that part of this story is about avoiding the exclusions that people were asking about when they asked, who's my neighbor? All right, everybody's your neighbor, but it's also an invitation to pay close attention to those immediately around you, to not just solve problems half a world away with a thought or a check, but to connect. And we're pretty passionate about that in this place at this particular time at our church. And it actually became part of our vision statement that you've talked about for quite a while now over the last three years, this importance of us making a difference in the three to five miles around this place, that we want to be a global church. We want to be a missional church. We want to have an impact around the world. But if we're not having an impact in the three to five miles right around where we live, the houses we can see and the businesses that we can walk to, what are we really doing with our loving and our serving? I think as I'm processed through some of the ways I approach life, when I avoid genuine connection but even do good things, if I'm truthful, I'm probably assuaging guilt more than loving my neighbor. I'm probably living by duty more than loving my neighbor. And I'm not saying that God can't take our time or our, you know, again, it's his time, that he gives us or our resources that he gives us and use good things with them. He can. But I do think there are times when we're just trying to pay off what we feel like through some sort of duty, through time or talent or treasure or whatever it might be. That's not what God really wants. In fact, Scripture says he doesn't really need anything from us, but he desires relationship. He desires that to live out. And I think there's something that is impossible to overcome from a non-believer standpoint when they see this, that something real is happening when we're genuine. You know, there are a lot of people who don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ that can give a lot of time. I have some unbelievably great neighbors who donate an immense amount of time but don't know Jesus. There are lots of people who could, you know, not know Jesus and make a massive amount of difference through financial giving. To my knowledge, Bill Gates doesn't know Jesus, but the Gates Foundation gives away a lot of money. You know, they make a difference. But what Jesus is calling us to is this idea of serving, being giveaway people through genuine connection to go and be likewise, to be a good neighbor, not to be a good donator of time, not to be a fixer, not to be a good that, and those are different things. And everyone is worthy of us serving as a good neighbor. That's what this is continually pushing to because, you know, as I'll talk about in the next one, we look for loopholes because we struggle in some areas. Yeah. And speaking of struggle, that takes us to our last place that we have to remain anchored in if we're going to talk about loving and serving our neighbor. And it's that we have to be willing to be loved and served. That's key to avoiding that over-functioning trap that we talked about earlier because it's going to do a few things for us. One, if we get so caught up in loving and serving others and never allow ourself to be loved and served, it's really hard to not develop a view of people and of the world that results in some level of superiority of me and inferiority of others and all these people that need. And thank goodness I don't. Because you do. Because you do. And we cannot truly give what we have not received. And we can't give what we don't continue to receive. You need to be loved and served by others. You need it in an ongoing way. And for many of us, that is the most uncomfortable place. Fine, I'll give more money and I'll give more time. Just don't make me ask for help. Yeah. And just a little heads up, in several weeks when we get in the second half of this series when we talk about living in community and we've just defined community as a place where your story is known, shown, and grown, there are some aspects where we're known better. And one of them is when we allow other people to help bear our burdens. And for some of us, I was just spending some time in that section of Scripture this week, the very idea of allowing someone to do something for us makes our skin crawl. But hear this, even Jesus modeled this. He even modeled that the God of the universe in human flesh allowed other people to serve him. Often. Yeah. Modeling our behavior. Not because he needed it, not because he was weak or couldn't handle it, but because he was showing us a way to live because we do need it. And there are things certainly we can't handle and we're never designed to handle by ourselves. So as we wrap up, just ask yourself that question. Do I model a life? Not just believe in a life, but do my actions, does my lifestyle model a life that gives equal value to serving and being served? And again, if the temptation is to point out, well, Jesus said, you know, he came not to be served, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom. Yes. And then look at the number of ways he allowed people to serve him. The number of meals that were prepared for him that he didn't cook himself and not as payment, but just as gratitude. And then the moment that he promised would be told wherever the gospel was preached of someone taking a jar of perfume worth an insane amount of money and anointing him with it. And the outrage that ensued of that could have been sold, that could have helped, that could have served so many people that could have solved so many people's problems. And his response was, this was a really good thing. This needed to be done. So friends, thanks for sticking with us as we go through this very uncomfortable topic of how we love others, how we serve others, and how we allow ourself to be loved and served. So thanks for sticking with us. And we're going to be back in about 60 seconds with the second episode. No costume change, no change in location, nothing. But in between, do make sure you check out the next message in this series before you come back with us. So until then, he's Brian. I'm John. We'll see you next time.
