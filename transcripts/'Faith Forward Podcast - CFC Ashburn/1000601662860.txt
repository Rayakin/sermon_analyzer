Welcome back to the Faith Forward Podcast, John Ackerman, Brian Bales, and we have reached the end of the suffering. Well, not really, not even close. But we have reached the last week of this series of Alien Living in First Peter. And as we close, the highlight isn't so much going to be suffering, but still something that's difficult, still something that's challenging, still something that requires something of us and requires us to engage in it over the long term. We're talking about the battle against an enemy. And so as is always the invitation, check out the Sunday message first, not only for all the value that's there, but for the context of what we're going to talk about, because we're kind of going to dive straight into one of the parts of the message. But as we always do, the quick highlight reel for this Sunday's message, what did that look like? Well, I will say this, that before we jump into the highlight reel, it's going to ask us and do some things that aren't necessarily that easy. Now, for people who listen to audio to this, they don't know this, but like if you're watching on YouTube or those sorts of things, John and I look the same height on the video. We're not, right? What I love about it that makes me look taller, because I'm at the age now where I'm regressing in height, that all I got to do is take this little switch and then I'm taller. And I wish it was as simple as let's just flip a little switch in our life and we're going to be able to do what we're being called to do. But as we get to the end of first Peter, here's the basics of it in a nutshell. We've been called to live the goodness of God and show that to other people by living holy lives. This is the call, right? So when we live the holy life, it shows the goodness of God. So we have an enemy who doesn't want the goodness of God shown in life. He comes to kill, steal, and destroy both us and the message of God for other people. And so we have to understand at the end of this book, one of the things that Peter brings to the very, very forefront is this, is that there's an active enemy against the way of living God has called us to, against the alien living life. And so in that, what he's saying at the end is that we need to be on alert. First Peter chapter five verse eight is one of, if not the most famous verse in all of first Peter. It says, be on alert, be sober minded, be watchful, depending upon what version that you might have that you read from. But it says this, your enemy is like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour. That actually means to drink down. This is really powerful imaging when you think of it that way. So it says, be on alert. And he gives us some basic things to say, all right, if we're stepping into this life, we don't expect that it to be super easy, like, whoop, just mess with the chair, but that there's going to be some opposition. And so difficulty, as I said on Sunday, is the reality this side of eternity. What is not necessarily the reality is proper response. So difficulty isn't unusual, proper response is. And so what we want to talk about is how do we not only just properly respond to the in and out everyday suffering that happens in a fallen, broken world because of sin, but also dealing with the possibility of suffering, the possibility of difficulty, the possibility of challenge that comes from an active enemy. And so we're going to talk about that today, what it looks like and try to take our faith forward and kind of expand on some of the things that I expanded on Sunday. Yeah. And so to start with, as always, the goal is to be practical and you hit one of the most practical things right off the bat on Sunday, which was, you have an enemy live like it live like it. That's one of the most practical things you can do. But you know, one of the reasons why I felt like I needed to say that on Sunday is I think that especially in the Western culture, Western mindset culture for sure. So that doesn't mean, you know, it could be the European continent. It could be, you know, the Anglo type cultures, maybe more so, but definitely United States and Canada, Europe in that sort of way. The way the enemy appears looks a whole lot different, right? I'm convinced that if the way that the enemy appears in some other cultures happen in this culture, we would be much more cognizant. In fact, it would probably make us run to Jesus more. But since he knows that would happen, he disguises himself. And so, especially in our culture today, it's really, really easy to look around and not recognize the schemes of the enemy. And one of the biggest schemes he ever does is to make us feel like he's not real. Now, I'm not the type of person that likes to quote a lot outside of scripture, but one of my favorite movies of all times, The Usual Suspects, quotes a guy and says, it's the greatest lie the enemy ever created was to convince people he wasn't real. Now, he was talking about another character in that movie. I'm not pushing that movie one way or the other, but you know what I'm talking about. I was going to use the same quote, honestly, so I'm glad you did. We're on the same page, right? So a little Kaiser Soze moment. But that's really the truth. That's what the enemy tries to do, especially in this culture. And so I felt like I couldn't just step over the fact that your enemy is real and assume it because while I think it is clear that cognizantly we recognize the enemy is real, the way that we live a lot of our lives sometimes just contradicts that. Yeah. I mean, the scriptures are abundantly clear that we live in the midst of a battle. We live in the midst of a battle in the heavenly places. We live in the midst of a spiritual battle here on earth. And you're right. We look around at our day-to-day, wherever you find yourself as you're listening to this, and chances are pretty good that's not what your day-to-day physically and visually resembles. And it's so easy to ignore the things that aren't obviously put right in front of our face. Yeah. I think that, again, is just this reminder that we do have an enemy, but also I didn't delve into it super well on Sunday, is to understand and recognize, respect appropriately who that enemy is. Yes. I think I can make a case biblically that Lucifer, the fallen angel, Satan, devil, adversary, whatever term we want to take from scripture to apply to him, we recognize that from what we can understand, he was probably the most intelligent being ever created. And while the enemy is not in our head, right, he doesn't read our minds, any of those sort of things. That's for God and God alone and his power to do that. We do need to recognize simply this, if you amass his intelligence level with, if you also amass the amount of time that he's been, you know, traversing the earth with the information he's able to collect. One of the analogies I often use is this, we're right here outside of Washington, DC. So many people work for the government or work around the government, they have top secret clearances, whatever it might be. You may be listening to this from Iowa and it doesn't connect with you, but one of the things I often say is this, like, how much do we actually believe that the NSA, the National Security Agency, knows about us? And if you say a little, you don't know a lot about the NSA, right? They know a ton. They could be listening right now on my phone and there's not a thing I could do to stop it. And with all that they know, they're able to put together through wisdom and experience how to get at a particular person and create a strategy. Now I want you to take that and multiply it by whatever you want to multiply it and then you're starting to get into the realm of what we're talking about the enemy. All that he knows, all the strategy, again, he is not God, but what he is, is the most intelligent created creature from God. And he's able to put those resources to bear against us. And so when he comes into our lives and tries to trip us up, I love the fact that it's saying he is like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour. But I would also like to remind us that he doesn't present himself over and over like a lion that we're going to see. We discover we've been devoured after we've become lunch. Not like, oh, there's a lion, I should probably run. He doesn't present that way. Yeah. No, not at all. And so you laid out sort of a twofold practical perspective to have, thanks to C.S. Lewis, that if we're going to live like it, which is practical step number one, live like you have an enemy. That means you don't need to joke about him, right? We're not poking fun at a stuffed lion like, oh, isn't he cute? He's been declawed. He's not a threat. He has the victory. The battle's over. Sure. We get to live free and clear in this life. That's actually not what the scriptures say. We get to live free and clear in the life to come. But here on this earth, in this life, we're living in the midst of a battle. So don't joke about and minimize this enemy. Yeah. And then don't ignore him. Don't pretend like he's not there. And the one that Lewis doesn't touch on there, but he's touched on in other places and the scriptures do as well, is don't over-focus on the enemy. And it was funny as we both talked about this point, we came at it from two different directions. Okay. Because the thought that I had was some people, when they really begin to take the enemy seriously, they start looking for him under every rock and behind every door and in every single aspect of their life. And everything becomes the enemy's doing. Flat tire, that's the enemy. The milk went bad in the fridge. That's the enemy. I had an argument with my spouse. That's the enemy. Right. And again, any one of those, all three of them could be, but just because things don't go the way you planned doesn't automatically mean that was the enemy. Yeah. I mean, we could take a lot about that, at least the flat tire analogy and say that means nothing other than a fallen world. Or maybe just maybe God gave you a flat tire because he had something he was protecting from or something he wanted to teach you. So all of a sudden taking moments where we define something as bad and always applying it to the enemy, it's clearly wrong because there's some things that we define as bad that God doesn't define as bad at all. But there are some things that are across the board bad, right? You know, if we find cancer, God doesn't give people cancer. That's not as, that's the broken sinful world that we live in, but doesn't mean Satan gives people cancer either. It means broken sinful world. And so it's this sort of tension, maybe that's the right term, in that sort of triangle where we don't want to, everything's Satan, joke about Satan or ignore Satan, but live right in that middle that we're going to talk about, about how to take our faith forward. You know, how do we live like it? And to live like it, we've got to, I think, be able to recognize the enemy. I talked about that on Sunday. We're going to talk about here in a moment. And then we've got to, in many ways, delve more into scripture because that's where we learn how to recognize and through the spirit and how to recognize. And then as we'll talk about, you know, we've got to put this into practice in some ways. That's, you know, not easy many times. Yeah. So depending on your faith journey, depending on how much time you've spent in places like this, some of this may be old news and that's great because the things that we're going to talk about, we never stop practicing because you never stop living in a world at war until you enter into eternity. And so for some of you, this may just be the reminder to continue to do the things that you used to do. That again, greatest lie of the enemy ever told was that he's not there, right? One of the traps that he often lays for more experienced believers is you don't have to do these things anymore. You're past that. That's for new believers. That's for the young folk. You could never get taken in by the enemy. Now you've been doing this way too. That's a trap in and of itself. And so if you find yourself listening to this going, I already know all this, then just take a quick stock. Have you been doing it? And if you have great, outstanding, fantastic, sincerely job well done. That's how we're meant to live. Yeah. Right. But if you realize you've taken a bit of a vacation from some of these practices, it may be time to re-engage, to enter back in. So one of the things that the scriptures encourage us to do, Paul in 2 Corinthians gives this advice in the middle of some context that we're going to talk about in a moment. But the specific advice that he gives in this one particular section is he's talking about the need to forgive someone. And he's saying, you need to do that. You need to forgive so that Satan will not outsmart us, for we are familiar with his evil schemes. And I find that phrase so interesting because what Paul seemed to be implying there was that this is common knowledge. It's common knowledge that we all know how Satan acts. And I find that that does not seem to be the case in a 21st century church. Well, it's really interesting. It's definitely not the case in the 21st century church. And then you also think about who the church was he wrote to when he wrote this. The Corinthian church was all jacked up. That's Greek for messed up, if you didn't know that, right? There seemed to be like, they weren't. So we don't know exactly if Paul is being gracious and kind, if he's saying that in a way like, oh, you know this. And we do, I think times no stuff, but we're not practicing or we don't remember. But you know, it's this call that we're going to talk about that, you know, again, in 1 Peter. And Paul as you know, Peter, the apostle to the Jewish people, Peter, the Paul, the apostle of the Gentiles that they say in overlap, maybe just a little bit differently, but he's talking about learning this way to resist. And when it says to resist the devil in 1st Peter chapter five, verse eight, one of the things I said on Sunday that I want to reinforce now is that is a defensive posture in the power of the Holy spirit. That's not okay. I'm going to go pick up my life and I'm going to go after the enemy. First off, you don't have the strength to do that unless the Holy spirit is in you. And number two, how the Holy spirit asks us to engage the enemies always through his power. And when he says to step forward. And so that's really that sort of be on alert, resist and be ready. And the schemes sometimes I think come into play that, you know, Paul was talking about there that we're missing is, is we forget even that what our role is in resisting or that we begin to think, okay, now I know this. I'm going to go and do this in my power. And so, you know, that's one of the great schemes I think of the enemy that even when you know the truth about what needs to be done, we believe a lie about how it needs to be accomplished. Absolutely. So we actually have, we've spent some time on this topic in past episodes. In fact, if you go back in the fall of 2022, uh, just this, this past season, we actually did a two part episode that I believe if I'm remembering correctly was titled the road to freedom. And we talked through at length, at length, some of what we're now going to do in compressed form, but there's really two main schemes of the enemy. He's got a few others, but we're going to highlight the two that are most frequently used because they're so effective. Yeah. And I think that's really interesting. You'd mentioned he's got a few others and people like, oh, well he's only got two. Well, I would just say this. If he only has two and he's been actively on this earth for 6,000 years attempting to accomplish that. They're really, really good. And I think when we talked about this before, I made the analogy to Mariano Rivera when he was a closer for the Yankees. He only needed two pitches because no one could hit them, the fastball and the cut fastball. You don't need more than that. And so again, I'm not saying that the Yankees are Satan, but that's for a different discussion at a different time for all our New York fans. But it's, it's the point is it's really, really good. It's a fastball and a cut fastball. It is. Yeah. One of the key schemes that you will find give you the most traction in this battle is the awareness of the enemy's lies and the awareness of the tension that he creates between people and between people and God in the area of unforgiveness. And we talked about unforgiveness as part of this series. It might've been week four, five, somewhere in the middle of it. We've been talking about suffering for a while. It's blurring together in my head, but we're going to, we're going to revisit both of these topics today as practical reminders of this is how we engage this battle. And so when we talk about the first scheme of, of Satan as a liar, right, Jesus makes this pretty clear in multiple places in the scriptures, um, specifically multiple places in the gospels, but he says it in John eight, the most succinctly that Satan is the father of lies and that when he speaks, he speaks his native tongue, right? He's a liar and that that's all that comes out of him. Right. And so it's a helpful reminder then that I think many times, especially in 21st century America, we've been given so many tangible visual examples of evil. So many great movie villains, you know, a lot of really horrific violence in cinema, um, in now TV series, we feel like I know what evil looks like and it's a brilliant scheme because this is often not what we're looking for. We're looking for the overt evil and we miss what scripture pretty clearly illustrates in multiple places of the way that he primarily deceives, which is through plausible alternatives, as you said on Sunday. And so we look in Genesis three, when the serpent comes into the garden or he doesn't come with a legion of fallen angels to wage war on the garden, mostly because they already lost that way. And I want to pause here because I think if you think a little bit like me, it's possible to go, well, this is Adam and Eve, right? And they've never experienced this before. Fair enough. And to think, oh, that's why they fell. Fair enough. But I would also say they're the only two human beings that's ever existed on the planet with a perfect mind created by God. They had no sin in them at this point. So while they may not have experienced temptation before and have maybe a way of experience, they had the clearest, most understanding, most intelligent, uncorrupted mind ever. And they still got deceived by this. So just for those of you who may be like me, sometimes I go, oh, but that's Adam and Eve. They were like five-year-olds. Not dismissively, but I mean, you know, yeah. I think there's oftentimes where we think we put ourselves in that position and go, I wouldn't have done it. And you're right. I mean, they were in a condition that we have yet to experience and still fell victim to this. Yeah. So he comes with a plausible alternative. He comes with a deception. Did God really say? And then follows it up with a blatant lie, right? No, you won't die. In fact, this will make you become like God, right? First question what God said and then provide an explicitly wrong interpretation of reality and get them to bite. And they do. And you see him use the same tool with Jesus and during his temptation in the wilderness, right? Jesus gets baptized, led into the wilderness, fasted for 40 days and tempted by the enemy. And Satan's first temptation is in direct contradiction to the thing that God had just said audibly at his baptism. God said, you are my son. This is my son in whom I am well-pleased. This is my dearly beloved son. This is my beloved son in whom I delight, depending on your translations. Satan's first temptation, his first distortion, his first, did God really say is if you're the son of God, God just said it, but if it's true, and then just, you know, here, do it. Do it yourself. Command these stones to turn into bread. Feed yourself. I know you're hungry. Fix it yourself, right? This is, this is his primary MO. This is his primary modus operandi. This is how he works most of the time, deception and plausible alternative. And if we're unaware of that, if we are unaware of the frequency with which we are having deception offered to us, and if we are unaware of the frequency with which we engage it, partner with it, agree with it, bite down on that hook, we're, we're hopeless. Yeah. I think one of the temptations that we have in the midst of this is to think we are more prepared many times than we really are. And so you see that pattern in Luke where here's Jesus who is modeling. So let's pause here, right? Everything Jesus did on this earth was to model for us a way to live in submission to the spirit of God in us. That's why in many ways he's called the second Adam. He's showing us what we should have been doing. It's a longer theological discussion for another time. So when Jesus does something in the way that he does something, there's always a reason and many, many, many times that reason is to show us how to do it ourselves. And so when he's presented in the temptation with plausible alternative, you don't see Jesus by the way, which I think is super interesting using his fully God side. What he does is he quotes scripture he, because he, we don't have that fully God side, but we do have the word of God through scripture and he lines it up. Well, this is what scripture says. This is what scripture says. This is what scripture says. And so, you know, we're 20 minutes into this and we haven't said, ask God yet, but I think I want to tweak it a little bit. You know, sometimes you're like, well, ask God and, and we don't need to ask God because God said, and it doesn't mean we don't have a relationship with God and ask him. The point is, is that are we prepared? And that's one of the things we talked about rooted. We've done about this before living in the seven daily rhythms or rhythms of our life to be more spiritually in tune with God is that we said daily devotion, right? What does that look like? Daily engaging in scripture. And when I say engaging it, sometimes it means reading it. Sometimes it means maybe you're just choosing every day for a week to meditate on first Peter chapter five, verse eight, which says, be alert. What does this mean? God helped me understand that is being devoted to his word, right? So it has multiple applications in this, but I think that is the example that Jesus is trying to do here. Show us how we should do it. Because think about it. Jesus didn't have to do it this way. Jesus was responsible for the very creation of the angel, angel Lucifer. He stood all the power, had all of that, but he chose to model this. And so learning his schemes means that it's just going to be a little bit off. I think lots of times rarely in my life, I know John, uh, if your life is the same, but I don't really recall those moments in my life are like, that was really obvious upfront that that was way off, but it was probably after a period of time, you know, hopefully shorter than longer that we realized, Hey, this was, this was off. And so, you know, that goes to this idea of learning to recognize those lies, knowing scripture. And that's also, you know, one of your favorite sections of scripture, I think is, you know, second Corinthians chapter 10, verse five and six. I know we've talked about it before, but yeah. Yeah. The idea that, that some of these lies, they're not just coming in today for the first time they've been coming in for a while and they've taken root. Um, they backed up the U-Haul, they unpacked, they set up a room, right? In fact, that section in second Corinthians 10 talks about strongholds, right? And, and that's really what those are. It's, it's the construction of a place that has such deep roots, such a deep foundation in us that it's, it's a place that frankly we retreat to. Sure. It's your man cave. It's your she shed. It's the place where you feel most comfortable that you can hide from reality. Yeah. Right. And that's why we love the man cave and the she shed, right? You can go in there and close the door and hide from reality. The problem is that's not reality. And that's what our strongholds are. The strongholds are the, the lies, the deceptions, the plausible alternatives that have taken such deep root in our heart and they become so comfortable. It has become our own little version of the man cave of the heart or the she shed of the heart. It's the place that we retreat into for safety and comfort and protection when the world just doesn't seem to make sense anymore. The problem is it's not reality. It's not true. And it's not God. And it's not God. Yeah. And that is where we ultimately are designed to turn to. And, and we've said this before, we are not designed to live independent lives. We're designed to live dependent upon the Holy spirit in us lives. And so when those things come in, our first natural reaction should be, God, what do you have to say about this? Bringing those moments. And we'll talk about this, uh, I'll hop ahead now. Yeah. I think one of the things in this moment, when we talk about, uh, in second Corinthians chapter 10, verse five and six, it talks about this idea of taking every thought captive. And we were just talking about this off podcast a bit. What does that look like for you? And what does that look like for me? And it may look a little bit different for you, but here's what practically what it looks like for me is whenever this thought comes into my mind, let me not immediately assume that it's a good or bad thought based upon how I feel, but rather ask the question, God, is this a youth thought, because sometimes as we've talked about suffering for seven weeks before this one, God could allow suffering into my life. And if I don't take that captive, that thought captive, I'll immediately think this is a bad thing. Sometimes there could be theoretical blessings come into my life. And I used to turn theoretical because sometimes theoretical blessings and real blessings look very similar, but you have to ask God, right? You have to ask him. And so what does it look like to practically live in this interactive relationship, which is why we talk about this over and over again, that yes, we can, we can have a relationship with God and he will still love us and care us. That, that looks a little bit like a relationship we have with an ATM that we only go when we need him, man, there's so much more. And why would we settle for that? If we could really embrace that more, that he actually wants us all the time interacting with him, asking him, what does it look like to take this thought captive, God, I have this thought. Is this you, is this not you? And so what does it look like to cultivate a way of our living that again, doesn't allow our immediate emotional reaction to whatever it be to dictate truth. And I've just discovered in my life, the better I do with that, even as little emotionally as I tend to be externally, I have lots of emotions internally that I feel about things when they come in. The, the more that I have the truth of Jesus permeating my life. And the less that I do that, well, let's just say that got a few mistakes in my ledger. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I like that ATM example. And honestly, I'm going to ride that one for a second, because I know that we use, you know, we're, we're trying to get people away from transactional relationship with God into a transformational relationship with God. And one of the things that I've discovered in this space in particular is, you know ride the transaction because the transaction may actually take you to transformation. So here's what I mean by that. You know, you were talking about, we need God more than we realize him, right? That, that we, we want God to do the blessing thing, to bring us the things that we want to protect us from the things that we don't want. And that's sort of the essence of the transactional ATM thing. We just need him to do that a whole lot more than we realize. And so even in this place of taking our thoughts captive, we don't realize how many thoughts pass through our mind, pass through our heart unexamined. And we don't realize how many thoughts we take captive on our own thinking. Like you were just describing, I know if this is right or wrong, we don't recognize just how many transactions we need to have with God on a daily basis. Yeah. And the cultivation of those transactions actually brings us to a tighter relationship. To ride on top of your riding on top of the ATM analogy. Well, I mean, when we go to an ATM, it's a recognition of need. Yeah. And so part of the problem is, is we don't go to the ATM if we don't feel like we need something. And so I love how you're saying this. If actually, if we understood at greater lengths, our need, that transactional would lead to transformation. Um, and that's, I'm going to process that. I like that. That was good. Because at some point, if you're going to the ATM 15 times a day, you find a different way of banking. Yes, you would. You would. I don't even like it if I don't, if I physically have to, this is not for this podcast, but man, if I physically have to walk into a bank for anything anymore, I'm like, I've done something wrong. Right. Plus who uses cash anymore? So no. So again, if we come back to this practically, here's the recognition that you have, so if you've ever taken our, uh, following God's voice class that we offer here a couple of times a year on Wednesday nights, um, one of the weeks I teach on the functioning of our physical brain, and one of the things that I've learned about our brain is just how cool it is. Just how much information we take in on a moment by moment basis. Um, neuroscientists, which I am not one have discovered that in any given second, your brain is taking in roughly 10 million bits of data, 10 million bits of sensory input from your five senses, 10 million bits of data per second. And so even if you're below average, you're at 5 million. Easy, right? That's a lot. Here's the fascinating thing about the brain, your conscious cannot handle 10 million bits of data per second. You cannot consciously process all that information coming through. And again, neuroscientists, which I am not one have discovered that. I won't even say the average person because that makes some people feel like, well, I'm not average. I am that pretty much all of us consciously process of those 10 million bits of data per second, 126 bits. Wow. So just think for a second about how much you are missing in a second. And the next second and the next second, and right, you're missing the bulk of what's going on around you. And that's just in the material world, right? Paul reminds us in Ephesians that there's actually a spiritual realm that we're largely unaware of. So we're about a hundred percent ignorant of 50% of reality, which is the spiritual, and we're roughly 99% ignorant of the material realm that we think we're expert in. And we think we know what's going on around us. We think we know what's true. Yeah. The other way you see this play out is with your social media feed, right? Compare whichever social media app you prefer to any random person sitting next to you. Ask their permission first. If they are in fact a random person, otherwise it's weird. Right. Your feeds are, my guess is wildly different. It's the same app, right? But your preferences, your tastes, your, your conscious inputs of I like this. I don't like this. I want to see this. I don't want to see that has trained that app to skip whole swaths of reality and just show you this little bit. And so it is with us. And so when we talk about taking every thought captive, it must be with that underlying assumption. I am missing a ton here. There is a lot that's going on that I don't actually see here or understand, and I need help. And you talked about Jesus as the second Adam, right? Jesus does what Adam and Eve didn't, right? Satan lobs up a plausible alternative to Adam and Eve, and they literally bite down on it. Satan lobs up a very similar food motivated, plausible alternative to Jesus, and Jesus goes, hang on. I don't need to figure this out. Yep. I'm not going to do this because I don't live on bread alone, but from every word that proceeds from the mouth of my father. We talked about that last week, right? He took that thought captive, meaning he didn't immediately reject it. He held it up and there was an opportunity for God to speak and go, yeah, that's wrong. You can discard that. Here's what's true. That's what we mean when we talk about taking every thought captive. Now, again, you can swing real far one way or the other with this. That doesn't mean you get up out of bed and go, hmm, should I put on undergarments today, God? But there's probably a lot more things in your day that you should hold on to and go, I think I know, but God, do you have something to say about this? Yeah. So there was one for me this morning because we said the temptation for some of us is to feel like, but I'm past this, right? This is, this is the rest of your life. Not because you're bad, but because you live in the midst of a battle until you enter eternity. So whenever I meet with people that are just starting to try to engage with God in this way, I tell them one of the most helpful things you can do is just make this a part of your daily devotion time with God, right? You engage God in the scriptures. You engage God in prayer. Maybe you engage God in worship as part of daily devotion, engagement with God. And then as part of that time, just ask God this question. God, what's the lie that I'm believing today? It's incredibly helpful in cultivating your conversational relationship with God because all of us are being lied to and all of us have been lied to. So there's always material to work with here. And so just make that a habit. And it's amazing how easily we hear the lies as well. Yeah. And one of the ways I think that you've already alluded to that a lie can really sneak in, in our lives is when it comes around this issue of forgiveness or in the ways that we've turned to unforgiveness. And just, again, we've said this before in the podcast, but it just strikes me that there's a chance someone could hear what we're about to say about forgiveness and not heard the other stuff. So we got to get this basic thing. When we talk about forgiveness or unforgiveness, we're not saying, saying that what someone did is okay. We're not saying that just let it go. And if they hurt you intentionally, unintentionally that you shouldn't be hurt, we're not saying that at all. It's the reality of pain. It's also forgiveness isn't saying that you need to be restored back in a relationship. If it was a particular person that's done something, um, that was not ever designed by God to be done to you. But what it is, is understanding how the enemy gets that root of bitterness in our lives and forgiveness, and we're not giving it back to Jesus. So it does disrupt any possibility of a healthy relationship between again, uh, example of, of Adam and Eve and God, or we'll talk about another one, you know, and a little bit, but there's, there's a lot, I feel like we're getting to this place in my head where I'm like, man, I want to go here and I want to go here and I want to go here. And we're not quite able to go to all those different places. But you asked this question when we talk about forgiveness in it. And I love this who, or maybe I'd even go, what is occupying your mental or emotional space? So I'm going to ask you what you meant by that. I know when I read that question, I reflected on practical things in my life where I'm like a scenario has occupied an immense amount of emotional space or a person has occupied an immense amount of emotional space. And that is a clear indication for me that there is, uh, something off in this particular case, we're talking about forgiveness. It's like, God, do I have things I still need to forgive? Or am I not trusting you in a particular way? If it's a scenario? Um, and it says, okay, when I'm able to give them over to God, because it's given him to trust him, it doesn't mean that we don't remember them. It doesn't mean any of that because there's no such thing as forgive and forget, but that doesn't actually happen in that way. It, but it is stops occupying that. Was that what you were thinking about as an indicator? Yeah. So, I mean, this is, this is Satan's good one, two punch, right? It's the deception in a place of pain. It's a deception in a place of confusion. It's, it's a lie in a place of doubt, right? That's what he did with Adam and Eve. Did God really say is an emotional punch? Can you really trust God? Oh my gosh. I don't, I never thought about that. Maybe I can't. Right. You, you start swirling, right? It's, it's, it's a place now of pain of tension of conflict of turmoil and into that comes a lie. Well, maybe, maybe, maybe this is what's true instead. Right. And so when you think about who or what is occupying your mental and emotional space, right, we're talking about places of pain, of turmoil, of conflict, of tension, right? And the, the coworker that you're struggling with, the, the family member that you're struggling with, the, the random passerby that did something you didn't like and notice the thoughts that follow the thoughts about them. The thoughts about yourself, right? Notice the one, two punch into a place of pain and a moment of doubt or confusion or deception or plausible alternative. Right. And, and so it's into this space, right? It's these schemes in particular, Satan's a liar and the father of lies. And he steals and kills and destroys, right? He is destructive by nature, even as he is deceptive by nature. And one of his favorite things to do is combine the deception and the destruction into the same spot. One of the things that we notice in the scriptures is that, again, you go back to what Paul was warning against in second Corinthians chapter two, he was talking about someone who had done some things they shouldn't have done. And those early church followers in Corinth were advised by Paul, you need to separate this person from the community of faith, it's not going to be good for this to continue to exist and, and get all nasty in here. But then there was a shift. There was repentance. And Paul's advice now was you need to welcome them back in because if you don't, if you continue to resist someone who has had a change of heart, he said, this is where he says, so that Satan will not outsmart us, right? He says, I wrote to you as I did to test you and see if you would fully comply with my instructions. When you forgive this man, I forgive him too. And when I forgive whatever needs to be forgiven, I do so with Christ's authority for your benefit, so that Satan will not outsmart us for we are familiar with his evil schemes. Or he's saying that the scheme of the enemy is to create division, to destroy the fabric of relationships between people and destroy the fabric of relationships between people and God. Or look at what happens in the garden with Adam and Eve and God. His first target is the fabric of relationship between the two created beings and the creator. Let's get them to doubt God's goodness and God's heart. Great. Then you notice the fallout when God shows up later and he says, Adam, where are you? And Adam's like, it wasn't my fault. You gave her to me. It was her fault, right? The, the fabric of the relationship between those two, right? And we, like we said earlier, we even see this with Satan's temptation of Jesus in the wilderness. He's trying to get at the fabric of relationship between father and son. He's trying to sever those. And so this is where Satan loves to work, create tension between people or between people and God, and then throw in a plausible alternative. And so when we talk about taking our thoughts captive, we're asked to do it at the most difficult times. Which means that if we think of anyone who's ever actually played a sport, and I'm sure it shows up in other analogies. This is the one that comes to mind. What they say is, is that you're able to respond in the most difficult times better if you've practiced, right? That it's more second nature. It doesn't mean that you can't respond if you haven't, but there is a clear connection between your ability to respond well in an athletic endeavor in the midst of adversity and miss problem related to how you practice. And there is a connection here to what we're talking about spiritually that, you know, God can help us at any point clearly, right. To resist the enemy, but there's something to be said about practicing this concept of resisting the enemy. Like your life depends on it because your spiritual life actually does depend on this sort of practicing because there are moments the enemy doesn't give up. After we become believers, um, a section of scripture that is always just like, Oh, Acts chapter five. So if you go to Acts chapter five, you see Ananias and Sapphira, husband and wife doing something really good, right? So end of Acts chapter four, we introduced a guy named Barnabas, Paul and Barnabas. He's an example of someone who sells all his property and gives all the money. Now, Ananias and Sapphira, um, they sell property too, but they decide to only give half the money. Pause. Still pretty awesome. No one said they were required to give half. I mean all of it. That's just what other people were doing. And somewhere in this moment, they took in a lie from the enemy and thought it would be okay to represent. They did something that they didn't do. And what I think is really super powerful by Ananias and Sapphira for maybe a different time was Sapphira clearly lies to Peter and says, this is, this was everything that we got from the sale. Ananias doesn't Ananias just willfully lets people believe something that's not true. Today. A lot of people say, well, he didn't lie. The Bible clearly makes that if you knowingly leave an impression, that's not true. They, the Bible holds you for lying. Lie of omission counts. Yes, exactly. And in those moments, you know, what would have happened if they would have stopped and just said, God, is this okay? Cause we don't know why they were giving up half. It actually could have been, see, cause I think there's a temptation in my mind. I think, oh, they're being greedy. Maybe there was some sort of need in their life and they were being unbelievably magnanimous, but they didn't believe something about God in that moment, but rather they believe something about Satan. We don't know that they took in that they didn't ask and engage God with, because again, they weren't condemned for giving half. Yeah. They were condemned for lying about giving half. And that's fundamentally different. Yeah. And I wonder what it would look like if they would have been practicing resisting the enemy. And again, we need to practice it because again, just because we've come to know Jesus Christ doesn't mean the fight stops. Yeah. In fact, I mean, that's what first Peter saying, because he's writing to a group of believers to be on, on alert. Yeah. And it's exactly that, that Peter calls out with Ananias and Sapphira in verse three. He says, why have you let Satan fill your heart? You lied to the Holy spirit. In other words, there was something that seemed more true to you than what God had been, because they were part of this incredible movement of God in this, in this early church, right? They're caught up in it. They're not outsiders trying to, like, it seems like they're part of what's happening, but there's this moment, whatever it is. Whether it's money, or like you said, a need that they weren't sure of, or man, if we give all of this, maybe God won't, right? We don't know what the lie was, but there was clearly something from the enemy that filled their heart as Peter identifies as the root of this issue. And so the reason we have to practice is because our life depends on it, right? We live in the midst of an actual battle. And if we're not aware of the deceptions that are coming into our hearts, we're dead. Yeah. And we may not be the only casualty. And so there's another Ananias in the book of Acts chapter nine that God comes to and says, hey, I need your help with something. And if we were talking about taking every thought captive in the way that makes sense to us, this Ananias would have taken that thought and gone, nope, because the thought that comes to him is you need to go heal the sight of this man named Saul, who's been murdering Christians. Yeah, not something I'd want to sign up for. No. And how is that even any something that's good, God? Because this guy's a murderer. Right. So based on my logic, that was bad chicken. I'm tossing that, not giving a second thought. But this Ananias engages in the process of holding that thought and going, okay, God, if that's you, I'm going to need some clarification. And God goes on to clarify, this is God, and I'm asking you to do this. And I'm asking you to do this, not just for you, but because of what I'm going to do through what you're going to do. And so this is the invitation for us. And this is what God is inviting us into, is know me better and know your thoughts better, because not all your thoughts are my thoughts. And so as we come to the close here, and like you said, I mean, there's any number of rabbit trails that we could have gone down. One of them is, if you've spent time in this area of trying to navigate lies and navigating unforgiveness, and you feel like you're not gaining traction, reach out to us, faithforwardatcfcyard.org, and we'd be happy to talk to you. Because as we mentioned, there are a few other schemes that Satan utilizes, but this one-two punch works so well, it's what we see most of the time. But make this part of your daily routine. Begin to ask God on a regular basis, God, what's one lie? Right? Don't try to tackle all of them. God, what's one lie that I'm believing today? That you can help me identify is not actually true. And he will. And then our part is to acknowledge, okay, that's a lie, no matter how true it feels. God, if you're saying that's a lie, that's a lie. I had this happen to me this morning, right? Again, we all still have to practice this. Sitting there this morning, and I was like, God, what do you want to talk about today? And he says, your fear. I was like, this doesn't sound fun, but okay. He says, you're afraid I still won't come through for you in some areas. And I'm like, ah, I don't like that. I still believe that, but you're right. Right. I'm not going to try to lie about it. Yeah. Right. I still believe in some places you won't come through. And then there, I was like, so, so what's the thing that I believe that's not true. And here's the one that he said, he says, you don't have to obey people that don't keep their promises. And it was funny because the direction of that lie was aimed square at God. Cause there's some things that I felt like God has promised me and they haven't happened yet. And they haven't happened for a long time. And so my earthly reasoning at a heart level agreed with the enemy's temptation of, you know, people that don't keep their promises. You don't have to listen to them. It was sneaky. It was deceptive. It was plausible because anybody else that doesn't keep their promises, should you continue to engage with them and trust them? No, you shouldn't. Yeah. Right. He's good like that. Right. He's good like that. This is something that all of us continue to have to engage in, right? Satan doesn't give up the battle just because we're saved. Just because we've crossed X number of years off of our journey as a follower, right? There's still, there's still a battle that you were in the midst of. So live like it. Practice, continue to practice. And if you need help, reach out because you're never meant to do this alone. And as always, if you want to talk more about this, hear more about this, faithforward at cfcyr.org. We would love to continue the conversation, but for now, on behalf of Brian, I'm John. Thank you guys for being a part of this eight week series on alien living. And we'll see you for the next series, which is going to be a whole lot of fun too. Bye.
