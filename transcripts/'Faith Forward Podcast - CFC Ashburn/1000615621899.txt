Welcome back to the Faith Forward Podcast, John Ackerman, Brian Bales, and this is week seven in this series that we've called Heartbeat, the penultimate week, because we're actually going to wrap things up next week with week eight. I have to look up the term penultimate, but I think I know what it means. I just don't have big words early in the podcast today. I love words. They're great. So over these previous six, Brian, you and Lee and Mike have sort of been laying out this narrative of the heartbeat of God towards his people and beginning all the way back in week one with the heartbeat of God is to see all of his children redeemed and restored. And in the weeks that followed, we began to talk about what does that look like? To then live from a position of being redeemed. And so in this week, and here's the funny thing we're going to do with this episode, because you may, for our loyal viewers, listeners, we didn't have an episode come out last week because I was on vacation and it was fantastic. And so this is going to be a little bit of a catch up from Lee's message last week, as well as your message from this Sunday, which is the actual week seven of this eight week series. So as we're doing a little bit of a recap, we're going to start with Lee's message from last week, and then we're going to take it into this Sunday. So Brian, would you want to start by giving us a recap of Lee's message from last Sunday? Well, again, the premise is we've said is number one, God desires everyone to be redeemed, but then also to live from the fullness of that redemption. You know, there's a difference between my 22 years of marriage and living from the fullness of that. And when I was married at 22 days. And as I meet people at our church and other places, I know that I know a couple of those married 70 years, right? There's a depth and a fullness to that, that even at 22 years, I don't have. And so you will never fully plumb the depths of the reality of all that redemption does, but it's not meant to be just something that's at 22 days. And that's great. That's enough. But there's so much more, as you would often say, again, third way that we would call it as a podcast, faith forward. The third way is there's more, the second one we'll get to long time listeners or viewers or listeners. As I might say, I'm just as me trying to get back at the penultimate, I'm just making up words now. But we got to this week and Lee was talking about the God's desire is that everyone experiences that transformational grace, everybody redeemed. And one of the things he does is he places his redeemed people to live from their redemption in an area, in a geography, in a family unit, very specifically that you're where you are on purpose and that God is using that in using the things in our life. If we follow and listen to draw others and specifically to be this, this catalyst in many ways for repentance and repentance, isn't natural. When Lee said that, you know, when someone just says something like, well, that's so obvious, but why didn't I think about it? But it was, it was so obvious, but it was such a, oh yeah, it's not natural. I don't think that's something that we wake up every day without understanding scripture and what God calls us to do in our own flesh and our way of thinking, go, Hey, I just think I'm going to repent today. And again, as we've said in this many times before, as a common friend of ours defines repentance is this process of thinking differently because then as we think differently as Romans chapter 12, then we feel differently and we live differently from our will. So this idea, and so it's not natural or for anyone will encounter, but God wants to use us. And so I hope that as you listen to that, that you grasp that deeply, that God wants to use us. And then quickly, as I talked about on Sunday, I said this, our circumstances are real, but they don't have to control our heart, mind, and will, right? Things ultimately do not matter. Our relationship matter. And what that line, when I read that from someone, it just, it hit me in some ways. It's like, Oh yeah, it's our relationship that matters so much. And how do we view our relationship? Do we review our relationship and the freedom that it's supposed to bring, uh, in a way kind of like going back to two Sundays or three Sundays, I guess, no, now we'd listen to this, the older brother or the younger brother, uh, in that way. So that, that's it in a, in a nutshell, but let's kind of go back to where Lee was two weeks ago and Lee wasn't able to join us today for the podcast he was going to, but then life kind of went sideways. And I don't mean that in a negative way, just sometimes it does. And so the good news is, is that Lee might not even listen to this. So we can kind of say, this is what Lee said. And if you've not heard that Sunday, you should go back and listen to it. But if you've not, we'll just do our best. Yep. Everything's fair game. Um, so again, the goal is always with the faith forward podcast, make it practical practical application. And so with the focus on Lee's message last week being God has located you specifically. Right. He's put you where you are geographically on the globe, um, familially with the family that you were born into or are raising at the moment, uh, vocationally with the people that you're called to work beside, whether in volunteer capacities or professional capacities or in whatever way, shape or form. Right. And, and so one of the questions then becomes, all right, well, then what am I supposed to do? Right. I accept the premise I'm where I'm supposed to be. And I want to live out of the fullness of my redemption. And part of that living out of the fullness of my redemption means receiving all that God has for me and then sharing that message of redemption with the world. And for me, and this is just my particular way that I often view things is I feel like so often when the call to serve comes up, when the call to go out and reach out to your neighbors, to your family, to your coworkers, I often feel like there's a practical step that we sometimes either in our excitement to go and do that, or in our hesitation of, I couldn't do that, we skip an intervening step and it's your capacity to extend grace and your capacity to make people aware of the power of repentance. Is inextricably tied to the extent to which you are aware of the grace you've received and you are aware of your depth of repentance and not an intellectual level. This isn't about, can you explain the concept of grace? And this isn't about, can you define repentance? It's experiential knowledge as we've talked about so often as being so fundamental to this life with God. Have you felt God's grace in your life and both in an overarching way, but also in very particular parts of your life? And the same with repentance. You know, the one-time prayer that many people pray as part of accepting Jesus is the repentance for self-sufficiency of trying to do it on my own, of being my own God and recognizing I can't forgive my own sins, I can't make myself right with God and so Jesus, I surrender. I, you are savior, you are Lord. How often do we come back to repentance as an ongoing act and in not just drumming up all the list of ways that we've fallen short in the meantime, but recognizing the places in my life, like you had mentioned, not just about my behavior, but where I'm thinking in ways that are incongruent with living out of the fullness of my redemption. And I love the fact that you made it. It's not just about your behavior because you can have right actions and doesn't necessarily mean you have right thoughts. I mentioned that a couple of weeks ago and especially if you get in this over-performance mentality, you can be doing that. And so maybe one of the first tests for you in taking your faith forward is, you know, all right, what am I awareness of the grace I've received is, are you really aware of the grace that you've received? And you're talking about this, it reminded you of this statement that's often out there in culture. If you've heard the term emotional intelligence, emotional intelligence is a statement that's brought up to contrast it with actual intellectual knowledge about data and facts, because we've all been around people who have data and facts really good, but they don't know how to actually translate them into relationship. And so they're lacking self-awareness, they're lacking of connection. There's all kinds of issues with that. But we've also been around people who maybe don't have as much IQ, intellectual quotient, so to speak, but have an emotional, relational thing that they're just drawn, people want to be with them. People want to connect with them. And that is this idea of a higher awareness of people and themselves. And so when we talk about grace, grace, as you mentioned, is something that we talk about, but we only talk about it to the level of effectiveness to which we've actually experienced it. Right. I mean, actually understand it. And to make this practical, if you don't really grasp the grace that you're receiving, if you're a task oriented person, there's even possibly a task you could do to experience a different, why don't you sit down with your pen and your paper or your computer, your keyboard, your laptop, your iPad, whatever it might be, and begin to write out, type out, whatever it might be, those areas of your life of grace. It could be something as significant as a health issue to where you are now no longer what you used to be, or it could be something else, or even in the midst of grace, it's understanding that maybe it's not perfect, but man, it could have been a whole lot worse. There's a whole list of things there. And it begins to reframe our thoughts just a little bit about it. And what I'm suggesting in that is what you're doing is you're retelling God's story to yourself. God's story of your story to yourself. And the greater that we're aware of God's story in our story, the greater we'll be aware of the graces extended. And then, and only then, does it give us the capacity to extend grace. And I'm kind of tying something that you're going to ask in a second about effective ways that I've found to introduce Jesus and grace and repentance to other people. It has to really, really start with me, with how much I really understand, because I'm only driven, and we've talked about this in the past. We can be very duty driven people. Duty will dry up really, really fast in this area of showing and extending grace or, or this idea of repentance. If we don't understand the depth of which we have received it, because we're going to meet those people. Chris Heeds is a friend of mine. You know him as well. Many of our listeners may know him as well. He's a pastor at Mount Hope here in Ashburn, Virginia. He was on staff here at Christian Fellowship for a long time. He used this term a lot, EGRs. And EGR stood for extra grace required people. And the truth is we're all EGRs. We are all EGRs, but we will identify and we will have as much grace towards other people who are EGRs in direct relational connection to how much we realize the grace has been shown us by God. Yeah. Yeah. So many things that I like about what she said. And I think the first one that I want to touch on, you know, just the distinction between emotional intelligence and cognitive intelligence. Thank you. That was the penultimate cognitive statement. Sure. Oh, we're going to have so much fun with this. People who've dropped in the middle of this podcast, like what in the world does that mean? You know, and again, Lee's called to God has located you for a purpose, right? And there are people in your vicinity, in your spheres of influence that need what you have. And there is absolutely a need for what you cognitively understand, right? Even just being able to define basic terms that have been misused and maligned and being able to tell people, no, actually here's what repentance means. It doesn't mean just muscled up and try to be different. Right. Right. Here's what grace means, right? That, that is so critically important, right? We've been joking about words, but words matter. That's part of why I love words is that the right words help to communicate ideas and thoughts more clearly. At the same time, you can have all the right information. It's not going to make a dent in somebody's heart. And so part of living out the fullness of your redemption, where God has located you is learning to harness both halves, right? The cognitive intelligence that you have, your understanding of what is, and then the fullness of your emotional intelligence of being able to relate to people and recognize where they are. There was a story from the scriptures that was coming to mind. It's Philip in the Ethiopian eunuch from Acts 9, 10, somewhere around there. And I just, I thought it was so interesting. One of the times that I read that, that Philip's location, his geographic location seems to change quite a bit in a relatively short period of time, but God has him in his location for a reason. And so Philip's getting dropped in the middle of wherever this current place is and he sees a person and it would be real easy, as I've heard you talk about in different settings, to take God's plan and God's instructions and start transposing things. God's dropped me here, potentially very literally, and there's a person. God must mean for me to go and evangelize. And so let me just hustle on over to this chariot and start telling this man what he clearly must need to know. But what Philip does is he comes within hearing distance and he listens, right? That's the emotional intelligence side is I want to get a sense of who this person is and what their current context is before I start unloading the other half of my brain and its intellect. And by showing up and listening, he hears this Ethiopian eunuch reading Isaiah out loud and wishing that there was somebody there to help him understand. And so rather than Philip going in guns blazing with, let me tell you all the things I know, he enters into a moment where the intellectual part is asked for because he engaged with the emotional part first. And I think there's a lot of wisdom to that as we're taking advantage and being cognizant of where we're located, the practical ways that we go about engaging with the people in our location. It's a both and it's not an either or. Yeah, it reminds me of a series we did years ago where we called it grace and truth because our model is Jesus Christ and he was full of grace and truth. And so let me use that and sort of connect it to this idea of both grace and redemption and then say this verse. Scripture says it's the kindness of God that leads us to redemption. Okay. I wish I could remember exactly how it said, but kindness without truth is just flattery and lies. Truth without kindness is just brutality. And when we talk about repentance, depending upon your particular, maybe just bent as a personality or maybe your background, your lack of religious background, or maybe some religious baggage, you may think that repentance like, okay, well, I'm supposed to go and I'm supposed to be, you know, God's methodology, God's methodology, but God's person he's going to use. I can't think of the right term right now, but it's not penultimate. I can know that, um, to communicate this. So what I need to do is I just need to go and hit them with all my intelligence. And when I say intelligence, it means the truth of scripture using Philip as your example. But instead he did both, right? He led with that. So it's not calling for a lack of biblical knowledge, but it's also not saying that the biblical knowledge itself is the transformational process. The transformational process, the Holy spirit using the biblical knowledge, because there's lots of people in scripture in the new Testament specifically that had biblical knowledge, but no understanding of Jesus. So that it's that constant. Now we're going to use the second. Name of this podcast. If it wasn't faithful and ask God when God brings you into this place where you're supposed to be, what he's asking to be, ask him. How do I now engage this? And that is the most emotionally intelligent, spiritually intelligent we can be. And when I think about, you know, a question that he had written down here, what are some of the most effective ways, um, that I've experienced personally to introduce people to grace and repentance? It all kind of ties together. One of in this culture in this way. Now we find ourselves in 2023, at least that's when we're recording this. I don't know when you're listening, but in 2023, we have passed that stage where engaging people first with propositional truth works really effectively doesn't mean there's not propositional truth, but it means that is the lead, you know, they'll say something like, well, that's true for you. And we won't get into the, all kinds of philosophical problems with that or the challenges that, but I do know this is that their belief of that's true for me cannot be argued when I start with my story. See, when I understand the grace that God's given me and I'm deeper in that, and then God goes, one of the most effective ways that I've been able to talk to people about grace and then lead them to redemption, the opportunity for redemption is by being kindly sharing of my life and my story. And for everyone's a little bit different. I understand that because when people discover what I do for a living, some people may like, oh, well, of course you can do this because of this, this and this, but that's not why I can do it. It's because of what God has done for me. And he's asked me to do this and that's for all of us. And so I would say that as we think about all these things together, God has placed us in a particular position, whether it's in a family or whether it's at work or whether it's actually in your neighborhood, that the more that we're able to understand the grace in our story as he's placed us there, that is going to be one of the biggest, to use the term, apologetic defense of truth that you can give to people. And it starts there because, you know, they may think, well, that's true for you, but there's going to be something that scripture also says it's going to be attractive about that truth because it's not just truth for us. It's truth for everybody, but it has to start somewhere. And if I walk up in, as I would when I was a kid and I was taught to, well, here, let me just show you John 3, 16. Let me show you all these. Those are all true, but if they don't have any connection whatsoever to the truth of the God of scripture, it might as well be reading them Odyssey of the Iliad, some other ancient texts to which they recognize a lot of people read, but it doesn't really control their life. Yeah, absolutely. And it's making me think as well that, you know, things that I've, I've seen be beneficial, both directed at me, but then moments that I've had the opportunity to engage with others is I found questions are just so much more powerful sometimes than statements. And, and I'm sure you've probably had this experience as well, that, you know, when people tell you what they think is true, maybe I'm the only one, but often my default is let me figure out what's wrong with that statement, right? Let me, let me troubleshoot that. Let me fact check it. Let me, let me see if I can punch some holes in that. Yeah. When people ask me questions, I don't usually try to tear apart the question. I try to answer the question, right? Maybe that's just human hardwiring, but I found it's incredibly effective that if you want to be effective in the location that God has placed you in, ask questions. You know, depending upon how knowledgeable of the church world people may be, the listener, there's someone who's recently passed away, Tim Keller, who for me, for me, if, if there are people that say one 10th about me, the day that I die, what they say about Tim Keller, I will be 100 times a human being I am now. He's been unbelievably humble and to be used by God. And he's a brilliant intellectual. And he would always even downplay that. He wouldn't call himself a scholar. He would call him a practitioner is how he used the term, but he had this thing that he did. I thought, when we think about what it looks like, when someone would say something, no matter whether or not on its face, it seems rational or irrational, he would say, let's think about that for a minute and invite them into a conversation. Let's think about that for a bit. And then he would ask them a question just that way. And I love the fact, for example, that he didn't dismiss it and punch holes in the argument immediately, like you said, because he could have. Right. But number one, he invited into thinking about it, processing about it. And I think there are lots of times where people have invited us specifically or accidentally into thinking about it. Once we've reflected on the things that we've said, we're like, oh, you probably don't really believe that as much as it felt true at the moment. Right. And so I just thought as you were sharing that, it's a really good example of like when you hear that, you know, invite them in instead of just even ask questions, because some people, some people hear questions as interrogation and not just invite them into the, hey, let's think about that for a bit. That that's, that's, that's interesting. Let's talk about this. What makes you like, and you, you will discover, I know for me, I've discovered this, no one says anything. They says they say in a vacuum. Mm. Whether they're aware of what they're saying comes from some other place or not, but rarely does anyone say anything in a vacuum, whether, you know, like, well, I had someone who believed this stuff about God dot, dot, dot, dot, dot. And immediately they're transferring their beliefs about God through a fallible human being, or whether it's something else, maybe they just have never heard a plausible alternative. I remember talking to someone about something specifically scriptural before, and they were talking about the Noahic flood and they were talking about their concerns about whether it's legitimate or not. And I said, all right, I didn't say, let's think about it that way. But I said, you know, what have you heard? What have you heard? And then when I discovered what they had heard and then I said, Hey, can I show you something just about that? What I didn't begin to tell them they were wrong. I began to figure out what they heard. And then when I showed them, this is what it said. It invited them deeper into the discussion. Oh, well, maybe. It doesn't mean I buy all of this, but what I've heard about this was second or thirdhand information. This is what it says. And that opens a conversation to something else. Yeah. Yeah. The last thing I was thinking of, I love that. I love that by the way. And I'm just, I'm looking back at the, this last question for this section and I don't like that I did this, but I asked myself the question, you know, what are some of the most effective ways you found to introduce others to grace and repentance? And you had mentioned earlier, you know, take some time and write down the ways that you've experienced God's grace. And one of the things that I've started to recognize was I used to start those lists with the tangible things God's done for me, right? The times that he's shown up and given me something or helped me with something or, you know, however big or small. I now find myself more often thinking about the grace that he showed me when we're talking about like of biblical proportions, right? The reason that Jesus had to come like that kind of grace for me, the ways in which, and not just younger son, prodigal behavior, but just the ways that even now today, I still live my life either in micro defiance of God or micro rebellion upright, not like my whole heart is, is in rebel, but there's still pieces of me that are fiercely trying to cling to self-sufficiency, self-validation, self whatever, and if I was left to my own devices with Jesus out of the equation, I would still be an eternity away from God and giving myself space and time to recognize that, you know, when Paul talks about himself being the chiefest of sinners, I have to imagine that in his emotional wisdom, he's just not constantly rehashing the fact that I used to persecute people. I have to imagine it's a so much more comprehensive view of himself as an individual, that for the amount of his life that he truly thought he knew better than God or that he knew what God wanted and therefore knew better than all these other people that said, no, this is what God wants, right? It wasn't just about the external, but it was about the internal reality. And so now when I think about the grace that I've experienced with God, so much more of it is about the internal reality, the ways in which I've tried to live apart from him, which then goes hand in glove with my level of repentance, that it's no longer just for the bad behavior, past or current, but it's for the heart level, still trying to do it on my own. It's the, the fear of the older son, it's the license of the younger son. And when I share those parts, not just, I used to do a bad thing and now I don't anymore. Would you like to hear more about repentance? Yeah, right. But being able to invite people into those parts of your story, and that's a hard place to invite people. That's a vulnerable place to invite people because they're going to look at you potentially differently than they did two seconds ago. But there is no more powerful way to invite people into God's grace and repentance than showing them what it looked like for you in a way that is undeniable. So, um, I guess I would say we could probably spend a lot more time on Lee and Lee, if you listen to this, hopefully we address this fairly well. It would have, I'm sure been, you know, a little more tight or more precise, or maybe even the word effective might be used if you were here, but hopefully we honored it well. And hopefully you've heard some of those things that we are very clear about God's heart towards us and sort of make this switch now, I guess, to part two of a one pop, one podcast. And we talk about what I said on Sunday, which is that, you know, we're going to what I said on Sunday about that redemption. Actually, one of the things it's supposed to produce in us is freedom, but understanding what freedom properly is, is, you know, how we define it. Ooh, boy, it's different for all of us. And so going back to something you said earlier on, words matter, words matter, especially when we talk about this idea of freedom. And so when I got to this idea later on, uh, when we were talking about freedom, I went back to what we talked about a couple of weeks ago. Um, when we talk about younger brother, older brother, sort of what freedom they had or didn't have. And one of the reasons I went back to it is I had what I would think a good group of people sort of like, I didn't really think about that particular parable in the way that we talked about. It's not that it hasn't been talked about that way by other people. Just, they hadn't thought about it before, haven't engaged it that way. But I do think as we go into this idea that when we think about freedom, that sort of paradigm of the younger brother and older brother is also very helpful because a lot of people think about freedom that he gives us as I don't mess this freedom up and there's a legalism there, but then also there's a lot of, and that's the older brother. And there's a lot of people as well that like freedom means, oh, I can ask forgiveness, not permission. Yeah. And that sort of the older brother and that freedom is given for a purpose. And so that's kind of where we're talking about that when we got to verse 14 of the text that we talked about on Sunday, is that, but through love, serve one another right to verse 13, it says for the whole law is fulfilled in one word. You shall love your neighbor as yourself. Right? So he gave us freedom for a purpose to love our neighbors ourselves. And by the way, that's tied to, again, showing the truth about God and bringing redemption in their life. So it's all connected in this series, but now we're going to like, let's dig into serving because again, understanding freedom matters. But I think that when we look at serving, we should probably tackle the older brother mentality a little bit deeper because there is this thought process that I know you experience more than I do just because of the time that you spend with people differently than I do. Is that okay? That just means I got to go out and slave and do this and this and this and this and the heart's in the right place, but it's missing some, some true understanding about what serving is. And so I want to set up what we're going to talk about in this way, that we are called to serve. And many times as we go out and serve. As we do this, it creates and makes us closer to God, right? Yeah. But also there's this idea that as we grow closer to God, we'll serve. And so people can fall off the edge on either side. Well, I'm just going to completely serve and they're just doing it sheerly out of duty. And they are like trying to pour water out of a pitcher that has no water in it. And then they give up on serving like this doesn't work, but they're missing something. Or on the flip end flip side, like, well, I'm not ready yet. And I've got to have all of this closeness before I can go and serve. And there's really not anything that's true about ready. It's if God calls us, we listen, obey, and he prepares us. He equips us along the way. So as we do this, it's really key. We talked to this as always, second podcast title. We need to be asking God, where do we need to be on this? Because some of us need to be spending more time with him. And we ask him what he's like, you need to stay with me some more before you go and do this. You're not ready yet. Uh, or I got some stuff for you for this particular journey. Others of us, he's looking at us going like, I'm not going to tell you again. You keep coming back for more and I, you can't get more until you step into this because when you learn it's experiential in, in both. And so anyway, I, hopefully I set that up. Okay. Yeah, no, that was great. And I think we're not trying to overly complicate something, but I think sometimes there's a tendency to make things overly simplistic instead. Well, God put me here to serve, so I'm just going to go serve and I don't need to think about it because I know what God said. God said, go serve. In fact, I don't even need to ask God about it because God made it clear. I'm supposed to go serve. So I'm just going to go serve to the best of my ability and hope that that's okay. Yeah. And that is okay. That's a great heart. That's a great heart to have for people and for God and for yourself, frankly. And so we're not trying to make something overtly complicated, but I think sometimes it's a little bit more complex if we don't invite God more holistically into this, because sometimes God wants to serve, God wants us to serve out of our giftings and our strengths. Yes. We've talked about this before. There are times, like Paul talks about, where it's in our weaknesses that God's strength is made most clearly manifest. And so it can't always be God's will that we serve out of our strengths and gifts, because then there's never a time where we're serving out of our weaknesses. But at the same time, why would God give you gifts and strengths if you're always supposed to be serving out of your weakness, right? So again, it's a little, God's really good at both and approaches to things that we often want to make either or. And some of it as well with serving, I think is if we're being honest, like you had talked about, we each have a fundamental default or a way that we're most comfortable, and for some people it's ready, fire, aim, right? I'm just going to go. I don't even, you told me to go serve. I don't need any more instructions. They'll just confuse me. I'm going to go. And again, that's not a bad heart to have, but there's more. And then as we sometimes joke, there's others that are ready. Aim, aim, aim, aim, aim, aim, aim, aim, lower, double check. Okay. Ready, aim, aim, aim, aim, aim, aim. I'm not sure yet. Hang on one more time. Ready, aim, right. And you never actually fire. Yeah. And again, sometimes the people that are ready, fire, aim need to learn to slow down and sometimes the people that are ready, aim to the, you know, 10th power need to get more comfortable with ready, aim, fire. And so again, it's not trying to make it more complicated. It's the complexity of a God who knows exactly how roughly 8 billion people are wired at the moment and has throughout history that you should want to invite him into the process because he dearly wants to be invited into the process of you utilizing the things that he placed in you to utilize, because as we've talked about before, he doesn't need you to do anything and you can't do anything for him, but you can do everything from him and that's what he's after. Yeah. And so, you know, in looking at this idea, you gave some really practical things. Again, go back to the first name of the podcast, Faith Forward. When we go to serve, there's some natural things I think that we do. It happens a lot in church, actually. One of the things that we often look to foreign nations before we look to our neighbors, and we're really, really clear about this. We are to be missionaries. This isn't an America first, that sort of comment, but what I am saying, lots of times we look into our foreign neighbors before we look to our neighbors is because it seems safer. Yeah. I'm like, if it doesn't work out and I share my faith, I'm not going to see him again. You know, I'm not going to, but sharing with the person that we go on the missions trip in the perfect world is an overflow. We've been sharing with the neighbors that we've had. And sometimes by the way, we think, oh, sharing with our neighbors. I can do that, but please don't ask me to share with my family. Yeah. Because you know, my family remembers when blank, I think about Jesus. And brothers and sisters, you know, he had people that knew him in the community. Like, isn't this the carpenter's kid? I don't know what that complexion was, uh, the complexity of that rather is the term. But I know that in my own life that sometimes it might seem easier, like this group of people versus this group of people, or you mentioned, you know, what does it look like to serve my children before I serve my spouse? My point in that is not that you shouldn't serve your children before your spouse, or that you shouldn't go on the mission strip before your neighbors is why are we doing that? Yeah. Are we doing that from the heart of this is, I know I'm supposed to do this. I'm supposed to serve. And this seems what's easiest, or this seems what I'm more naturally gifted at. So of course that's what I'm going to do first. But have we asked God, because yes, God would not give us gifts if he doesn't want us to use them. But again, he also says that from weak, we're strong. And my personal belief is one of the reasons he reminds us when weak, we're strong is that we can't really do anything from our gifting to without him anyway. Right. And we can really, really fall into this, especially when we're gifting and those giftings. And we've talked to us before our bonus on top of talents that we have, you know, people who speak really well, then all of a sudden give the gift of teaching. It could really easy to fall into this idea of like, well, I'm just using my natural talent when he's like, no, no, no, that's not spirit ordained. That's not, you know, me speaking through you as a man or me speaking through you as a woman to teach this text. This is you doing your thing. And so I, to me, I can't say exactly why he put that in there, but I think it is one of the reasons he calls us to serve out of our weakness as a reminder that even when we're serving out of our strength, it's still him. Right. And it's just making me realize just how much this ties back to one of my favorite topics, which is how do you see God? What's your view of God? And so when we talk about serving, when we talk about the call to go and reach your neighbors or the nations or anything in between, do you view God as the parent that hands you the list of chores and then says, you know, I'll see what you've gotten done when I get home. And if that's the view of God, then of course you would be handling that independently and you would be prioritizing the list of, I want to do this first. And I remember when I got the chore list, when I was a kid, I did the least objectionable ones first, right? I did the easiest ones. And so, yeah, for some people, if God's the parent that hands the chore list, then I get to prioritize and it may be way more comfortable for me to do a week-long missions trip in a place I'm never going to go back to and be vulnerable with people there that are never going to see me again, rather than opening up to the person that lives next door to me or works across the hall from me, because that's terrifying. As scary as it may be for some to travel halfway around the world, for some, it's scarier to travel halfway across the cul-de-sac, right? And so we have to be aware of how our view of God is driving our view of serving. Because if our view of God is the parent that's handing out the chore list and then saying, I'm going to check up on this when I get home, that's not God. That's not God. God's the one who's inviting us into the family business to do the work with him. And he has some thoughts on prioritization. He has some thoughts on this is probably a good thing to do first, not just for them, but honestly for you, for your development and growth and cultivating both the strengths and talents and giftings that I've placed in you, but also cultivating your understanding of what it means to work out of your weakness. I think this is a good place to start. And it may be that first place to start, like you said, what's the reason we're doing it, that first place to start might be a trip halfway around the world. Or that first thing may actually be a trip across the hallway or the cul-de-sac. And so what I really had at heart here was just be aware of your perception of what God's asking you to do and why you feel like he's asking you to do it and what your default is if you're going first to the places of comfort, comfort's not bad, but if we're always defaulting to the places of our comfort, there's a pretty good chance that we're missing out on some of what God wants to do with us. And so that's the reason why it's usually most helpful to make sure we begin, or at least somewhere early in the process, make sure that we're starting as close to home as possible, and it doesn't mean physical home, that means you, right? You were talking about Jesus saying that the greatest commandment is love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength and love your neighbor as yourself. And for some of us, loving God and loving ourself is so challenging that we just jumped to, let me love my neighbor. Yeah. And so what you're hitting at is the assumption behind your is, is that can be missed, right? Because if you just pick up this section, Galatians chapter five, and you don't know the other stuff in scripture, which the Galatians did, by the way, we could miss this, that, that love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, and your mind. And the second is like the first, means the outflow of that is loving your neighbors yourself, but you cannot love your neighbor as yourself unless you properly understand your, your love for God. And so one of the things that in, in making faith forward is how do you cultivate that love for God? And so like in our last few minutes of that sort of thing, let's talk about that because one of the things I think that happens is that we fall into very particular preferred ways of cultivating our love for God. And I love the notes that you hear. We've talked about this before. If all truth is God's truth and the love languages, right. Are, you know, I just recently found out I had a friend of mine that, that handles the trademarks for the five love languages. So I should probably see whether or not he's going to pull this down, but yeah, all the trademark enforcement, a friend of mine does that. I didn't realize that. But my, my point is this, is that if all truth is God's truth and love languages are true, that means they come from God. Okay. But what we know about love languages is, is that we tend to fall into habits and we fall into the habits of this is more comfortable for us. So this is why we do it. Or one of the things that happens is built well, because I'm acts of service, which is my love language. I assume someone else is, but I have a wife that's words of affirmation. And so, or as my wife would tell you, she's whatever one she happens to be on the day, I just have to figure it out. But in some ways, what I'm saying cultivated, what's helped me cultivate a better love for my spouse is learning different ways to show the love and to grow in cultivating our love for God. Those of us who are acts of service, people are going to immediately go to this. Well, let me just go do, do, do, do, do, do, do. It's not a thing wrong with doing, but it is an aspect and you cannot completely cultivate a holistic way of love of God without looking at some of these others. So, you know, there's some things, others that we want to encourage people to do in, in these last few minutes about cultivating, right? Yeah. I forget when this happened the first time, but I was thinking about God in the context of love languages. And I had this moment of, he has all of them, right? He, he feels loved when we serve as he's asked us to, but he's also very much about quality time, right? And you see that replete through the scriptures. The, the number of times that God is just begging his people to come spend time with him, and he's the words of affirmation person, right? Not that he needs us to build him up, but right. That's really what prayer is. It's two way conversation. And we think how many times we look at the Psalms that I was just listening to something, someone's reminded me of the day, like it blesses God. That's words of it. That is affirming back. Right. Now that God needs, it's made more perfect and more holy and that sort of stuff. But it is when we bless God, we're giving an ascribing honor to where honor is due. Right. And we're speaking the truth of who we see him to be. And anytime somebody is on the receiving end of, I see you clearly and here's what I love about you. That melts anybody's heart. And then gifts, right? God loves gifts. And this isn't where we hit you up for your money, but God loves seeing people be generous with the things that he's given to them, right? That moves his heart. And then touch, right? Time in his presence, time in his presence. And so one of the best ways that we can cultivate our capacity and our desire to serve is to spend time with God, right? Not so much so that we never actually go out and serve. And somebody says, Hey, I feel like God's, you know, located you for a specific thing. Um, I'm spending time with God, right? Yes. And right. It's, it's, it's all of it. And so spend time with him, get to know him. And incorporate him into the things that you're doing, right? It's never, he's not the parent that's giving you the list and saying, I'm checking up on this when you come home, he's the God of with, as Mike Haynes said a couple of years ago, and it stuck with me, he's the Emanueling God. He is God with you at all times and in all things. And that's the way he wants it. And that's the way he wants you to want it. And so when we talk about being located, when we talk about serving, it's always in the context of with, right? God didn't drop you off in your location and say, I'll see you in six months to forever, right? He's with you in your location. There's things he wants to do with you. He didn't gift you with things and then give you a list and say, I'll check on you later. He's with you. There's no substitute for spending time with God in order to increase our capacity to lovingly serve others. There's just not. And so hopefully today as you've engaged, isn't again, it's been two parts and I don't think disjointed, but we've definitely said here's a heads and a tails and the same thing that you've been encouraged of what it looks like. They got his place you somewhere, but when he's placed you to serve and to love and what it looks like to properly serve, properly love what that freedom is given for and how to play out. But if you've been listening to this, you're like, Oh, I'm still struggling. That's okay. Yeah, that's okay. This, this isn't, I know I certainly have arrived on this. This is part of the process and there's such grace for that. But of course, if I've said something or John said something and you're like, Hey, could you peel that back a little bit or say some more on that? We would love to talk to you. Um, we tell you the best way to get ahold of us is send us an email. Um, and we'll get back to you and number one, we'll say, thanks for listening. Absolutely. So for now, on behalf of both of us, thanks for being a part of this penultimate episode on the heartbeat series. And yes, we'll see you next week for the last one.
