Welcome back to the Faith Forward Podcast, John Ackerman, Brian Bales, and we'd like to report a theft. Somebody stole our backdrop. Yeah. Many of you are familiar with the Charlie Brown Christmas as we get near Thanksgiving. This is more of the Charlie Brown Thanksgiving. If you tuned in on Sunday or you came in person, you know that we had this awesome thing here at Christian Fellowship Church where we baptize people in both services. Well, we realized a while back that when we were shooting the video for people online of doing baptisms and the wall behind looked like this, it didn't look like a very joyous occasion. So what we did was is we built this wooden slat wall that is designed for baptism, but we get to use almost every other time for our podcast, Faith Forward, to give us a little bit better background. And it's not been replaced yet because as our people who've been listening or viewing for a long time, you know, we do this actually before Sunday. Typically though, we do this on the Thursday before the Sunday. And this happens to be the Monday before the Sunday as the Thanksgiving holiday is coming up. So we're a little early. Our backdrop, we know where it is, but frankly, it was way too much effort for you and I to go pick it up and bring it up. That's a heavy thing. Yeah, it's heavy. Yeah. So not only are we missing our backdrop, but like you had mentioned prior to us hitting record, this is the earliest we've ever recorded a podcast. And so we're even less confident than usual that what we're talking about here will be said more or less as we expect it on Sunday. Yeah. Well, one of the things that often happens for me personally, and I know this is true for you as you prepare for sermon or you prepare for lesson plan is that you put it down and then you, you've invited God into the process of what you're putting down on your paper, but then you continue to invite God into the process throughout the week. I like to, you know, using now it's like a crock pot, you know, you can put it in there for two hours and it's going to taste good. If you put it in there for eight hours, most of the time it tastes a little bit better. I hope that's true with my sermon sometimes, but so it's a little early in the crock pot process. I think, you know, what we talked about coming up on this Sunday very much represents here. But before we do that, we were asking people to do something because we don't normally ask them to do other than to send us an email at faithforwardatcfcyard.org. If you want to talk, we are going to ask you to send us an email or other things, right? Yeah. Yeah. So this is episode 91. And if you caught the last episode, uh, we're moving towards our hundredth episode and not that there is a rule that has to come on fives and tens, but it is also something that we try to be intentional about here with the rhythm of celebration to honor milestones, to honor significant moments. And we've heard from any number of people that we've encountered either through email or just meeting here on campus that the Faith Forward podcast has had an effect. And so for the hundredth episode, which will air on Super Bowl Sunday, February 11th, I think that is, and culminating a series that we're wrapping up that day called Better Together. It seems like a great opportunity to invite you all to share the stories of what God has been doing in your life as you take your faith forward. So what I'm asking for is about a three minute recording, audio only. If you prefer that, send a video. If you want the picture there, send an email. If you don't want your voice to be heard at all, and we will read your email. But we would love for our hundredth episode to be a collection of stories of what God has been doing in your life as you take your faith forward. So this is episode 91. We've got nine more episodes, which works out to about 11 weeks because we're going to hit pause over Christmas and New Year's. So send those in as you're able to, faithforward at cfcyard.org, and I'm really excited to see what that looks like as we bring that all together. So we're approaching the end of our series on Nehemiah for something greater. Pretty sure this is week seven, but again, it's Monday, so it's a little hard to tell. This coming Sunday, Brian, you and your wife, Kathy, are going to talk about this idea of a fresh start always being available as we look at this period in the story of Nehemiah where the wall has now been completed, which had seemed like the significant plot point of the story, but it turns out that there was something greater that God was after, and we're now getting to that place. So you want to give us a quick summary of where we're going? Yeah, to put our minds sort of in the framework, sometimes I know in my life, and John, maybe it's true in your life, I think it's true in a lot of people's lives, it's difficult to get at the things in our hearts when there's so many things on the outside, like the tyranny of the urgent. An analogy I like to use is that if you've ever known someone that's broke a limb or you broke a limb, you can't deal with putting a cast on it until the swelling and stuff has gone down. There's some things here that God has always been wanting to get at in the Jewish people, in the people of Israel, the people of Jerusalem, that it was difficult to get at those. It turns out that God can't do immeasurably more than we all ask or imagine when the walls were down. But now the walls are rebuilt, now there's security, now God wants to take that moment and say, all right, now I want to deal with some inside of the walls issues, some inside of your heart. And specifically, what we begin to grapple with, this question on Sunday was, is that God had made a promise to the people of Israel many years before in a covenant they made in the book of Deuteronomy, you follow me, good things are going to happen, you don't follow me, you're going to wind up in persecution, all these things are going to happen, you're going to lose your land. Well, now we discover that they are back in their land. God is following up that promise. I think the question that hangs over this chapter is, well, they've got their land back, can they have their relationship back? And I think we've all been in places before where something has happened in a relationship, whether we've done it, someone else has done it, or whatever it might be, wherein it has done some immense damage to that relationship. And on earth, many times, because that damage is so amazing, we've messed it up, screwed it up, or blown it up, language I use a lot, it's just truthfully never able to be back to what it was, or maybe for some of us, never able to have a real relationship with that person again. And we often take our earthly experiences and we superimpose them upon the God of the universe. We all do. And I think that question hangs there for the people of Israel. I think it hangs in our life as well. When we've messed it up with God, when we've blown it up, whether we've done it intentionally or unintentionally, we've just made massive, huge mistakes, and we all have. Can we still have a fresh start with God? And the answer is yes, that He is the God of the promise. He's the God that we can trust. And what I talked about is we looked through the reading of the law, right? There's these moments where, now, all of a sudden, Ezra shows up for the first time in the book of Nehemiah, but remember, Ezra and Nehemiah were together originally. So he shows up, and after the walls are built, he's reading the law, right? The first five books of the Old Testament, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. And these people hear it, but they don't just hear it, they understand it and know this. There's a difference between hearing God's word and understanding God's word. That's what it talks about, then, when they heard it clearly, how it applied. And they wept, and there were a lot of things happening, but I walked through three major things that we'll walk through here about the heart of God towards us and a fresh start. One, that forgiveness is at the heart of God. Two, that security is at the heart of God. And three, is that the restoration at the heart of God. And I know we tend to get to the last point sometimes a little rushed. That's actually, for me, one that I currently find myself in, like this place where I know that I'm forgiven and I know that I'm secure, but can I fully be restored back to the way that relationship was, or do I have to live like a slave when he's called me a prince in that way? And hold on to that. If we don't get to fully that in this, hopefully, I got to it pretty well on Sunday. Yeah. And so we're going to walk through each of those sections. And today, I think is going to be even less, I don't know, teaching, further illustration than we usually do. And it's really just going to be an opportunity to pose some questions that maybe even just as you're listening to this now, you want to multiple times over the course of this episode, hit pause and ask God what he's saying to you in these places. But Brian, as you and Kathy are doing this message on Sunday, one of the very first places that this section of Nehemiah brings up is the people allowing God's conviction to really hit home. Yeah. And we love getting to the place of forgiveness and security and restoration, but getting to the place of forgiveness and security and restoration most times needs to go through our understanding of why forgiveness is necessary and where our sense of security has been addled and why the invitation to be restored needs to be given in the first place. And so we kind of have to start in this place of allowing ourselves to experience the same level of conviction that the people in this section of Nehemiah experience. But we want to sort of establish a foundation here because one of the things that we're both aware of from our own lives and from people that we've talked to is even just this word conviction has been used in a heavy handed sort of way. Sure. Either that all you are, all there is to you is a sinner and thank God, thank God that God saved you by his grace, but even with all that said, who you are and what you are is still just a sinner. You're a worm. That's it. And then some have skewed so far in the other direction because of God's extravagant grace and forgiveness and redemption that we never look under the hood. God doesn't look at my sins, so I don't need to either. And we miss the beauty of conviction and the opportunity for repentance. And so we just want to start with this baseline. There is the importance of knowing truth, that if you have accepted Jesus as Lord and Savior, that there is forgiveness of your sins and there is restoration into the family of God that you belong there as his son or daughter. And that knowing that information is important, knowing that intellectually and academically is critical. But there's also the importance of seeing where our knowledge of truth doesn't match up with what feels true. And I think one of the diagnostic sort of things we have asked ourselves, whether specifically, John, you've done it the way I have or not, I don't know, but I imagine it's very similar in principle, is when we hear certain things, when we hear certain words, what does that bring up inside of us? So if you hear the word conviction and immediately this is the feel, if you're listening, you can't see me something, my shoulders and crossing my arms. If you're watching, you kind of get it, this, or you hear conviction, you're like, you know, you know, you understand you're missing something. And I love how you brought this point out that this language in many ways is loaded. It's often loaded by inaccurate or bad experiences, and we have to make sure we go back to scripture. I mean, there are words people say to me that are loaded, John, you were thinking about conviction, you know, the word that's loaded for me, chat. If someone says, Brian, I'd like to chat with you, I, other than one human being who I've been friends with over 30 years, I don't know anyone that uses that. And like, well, I'm going to tell you about how good it is. Usually I feel like I feel like that way of conviction, like my shoulders slump in and my arms crossed, like, oh, this is going to be, I'm going to tell you all these negative things about you, Brian. In the same way, if you feel like conviction, that's how God is going to work. Let me tell you all the negative things about you or like God doesn't care because he's already forgiven you. And so I'm not going to deal with this anymore. There is really that balance and there are balances in all of our lives. I think that we fall off one end of the other. Some of it could be because, you know, our experiences, some of it could be because our different personality bend could be. But more than anything, we need to go back to scripture and see what scripture is saying. And one of the things about Ezra, when he read the law, is that when you get into them hearing it in the book of Nehemiah, some of them realized that their actions were actions of commission, like they knew the truth and they just weren't doing it. And some of them realized there was acts of omission because they had never heard the law before for one reason or the other. And they had been doing some things. So when you hear what we're talking today, whether it's commission or omission, we don't want you to either. That doesn't matter to me. I've been forgiven once and God doesn't have to ask me to confess my sins anymore. Or like, oh, I'm this horrible, horrible person. Hear me this. If you or I were a horrible, horrible, horrible person, God would not have sent Jesus for us. Number one, that's that's an example of his love. But I mean, but he also then he wouldn't want us to continue to draw back in relationship with us. He's calling us back now. That can fall off on both ends. So if you just snip a little bit of this conversation and say, well, Pastor Brian said, and usually when I'm quoted as saying something bad, it's Pastor Brian. It's he said that, oh, we're not horrible people. No, no, no. Listen, we are people who still sin, but our identity is not sinner. Our identity is son or daughter of God. Pre-conversion, our identity was sinner, enemy, combatant of God. Now it's not. So we are now sons and daughters who still sin. But that's not an identity statement. So this is what happens when it's on a Monday. I go off in little tangents. And so starting in this place of conviction isn't the most fun, but it's the most necessary because it's through this place of conviction that we gain a better understanding of all of these other things that God invites us to experience in this relationship with him. And so holding this tension of we are no longer sinners. We are now sons and daughters who do sin. And the things that we have done, in many cases, the things that we're still doing, even if we try not to, they're having an effect. And so this is less about the brow beating. This is less about the. Just the punishment than it is the you're my son, my daughter, and that's not the invitation for you. Here's the invitation is the reorientation that comes through conviction. Yeah. You wrote down a note here, which I loved because I've heard it many times before. Probably in my opinion, from what I've heard, one of the most beautiful explanations of the gospel, the gospel just means good news. It doesn't mean you stink. Yeah. Good news. Tim Keller, you wrote it. You get you get to read it. Yeah. He says you are more sinful than you could ever dare imagine. And you are more loved and accepted than you could ever dare hope. At the same time, that's the tension that that that is, but that's the beauty of it, because I struggle with that, receiving that, I certainly struggle with giving it in that way. And so knowing the difference, I think, in our lives between sort of feeling the weight of our sin, feeling the weight of our disobedience, feeling the weight of when we don't follow God in the way that he asks us for how it hinders that relationship. Yeah. And here this sin, nothing can hurt God, right? It doesn't make him less God, but he wants to have that relationship. So from a physical standpoint, it doesn't hurt him, but he grieves that our relationship is not the way he wants to be. So there's a difference in feeling the way I'm grieving the heart of God when I do this versus carrying the weight. Because for some of us, when we think and we have conviction in our life and when we think, okay, well, I want a fresh start, there's this sort of thought process that comes in, whether we realize it or not. Well, I can't get a fresh start until I fix what I messed up. Yeah, we can't fix it. He's inviting. It's the same way of thinking, oh, well, I can't take a shower until I'm clean. That's that's the purpose of the shower. When God invites us back into, he's not saying clean yourself up and then you can be back in the relationship. He's not saying you carry the weight of your sin. And once you figure out how to get rid of it, you can be back in relationship. But rather bring that to me. And that was the promise that he laid out to the people of Israel. That's the promise that he's exhibiting with the people of Israel here. And the reason we can claim so many of these promises is that God is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow. That means his character is still true and that he's forgiving, he's secure and restoration. They're all in his heart. Yeah. Yeah, so again, maybe it's helpful to go back to the scriptures to find this place of tension to how to hold it. So Luke 18, Jesus tells a story. And verse nine says, then Jesus told the story to some who had great confidence in their own righteousness and scorned everyone else. And Jesus said, two men went to the temple to pray. One was a Pharisee. The other was a despised tax collector. The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed this prayer. I thank you, God, that I am not a sinner like everyone else, for I don't cheat. I don't sin. I don't commit adultery. I'm certainly not like that tax collector. I fast twice a week and I give you a tenth of my income. But the tax collector stood at a distance and dared not even lift his eyes to heaven as he prayed. Instead, he beat his chest in sorrow, saying, Oh God, be merciful to me, for I am a sinner. I will tell you this sinner, not the Pharisee, returned home justified before God. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled and those who humble themselves will be exalted. And so there's the invitation is to not think better of ourselves than we are, but also to not think worse. Again, you go back to Keller, you are more sinful than you could ever dare imagine. And that's what the Pharisee was missing in that moment. He was just looking at, at least I haven't, or at least I don't, or at least I'm not. And he was missing the things that he was. He was, he's either blind to them or just refusing to acknowledge them. But he was also missing how loved and accepted he was. And so here's a place where we pause and just start asking some questions. Ask God, where am I focusing on the, at least I'm not, where am I focusing on comparison to others as a way to elevate myself or not feel so bad about the places that I know are less than they could be. And I want to, as you were saying that there's a thing I just want to kind of hop in. I think one of the reasons that we could not ask God, where are those places? And we say, at least I'm not, is because our mind is so focused on the things that we know are less than they could be. And we say, at least I'm not, is because our fundamental understanding of the character of God is messed up. Yeah. You know, certainly there are times in our life where like, well, at least I'm not, it's just about our pride. But I think there's also this sort of thing. I don't want to engage my issues. I don't want to engage with the help of the Holy Spirit, my pride or whatever it might be, because my fear is because when it comes out in the open, when I start to do what other people do, when my stuff comes out in the open, and that is less than, than I want to be treated. And so if you've ever found yourself saying, at least I'm not, you're like, well, I don't feel I'm prideful. Well, maybe it's a misunderstanding of like, if we come to God and share this, that God is going to reject this. Now we could talk a lot about the fact that God already knows. Yeah. And he's still seeking after us, says come back to me, come confess your sins. And so just, if that's where you find yourself today, it just, you know, that isn't God saying that. Yeah. That's, that's you or that's the enemy, but it's definitely not God. Yeah. And so here's another question. Um, just something to sit with. Do you find yourself willing to have those kinds of conversations with God? Are you willing to ask God to help you better understand your sinfulness? Are you willing to ask God to help you better understand, not just to better understand, but to experience the effect of your sinfulness? Because I feel like that's really what God's after is this. Isn't about creating the list. This isn't about solidifying the criminal record. This is, do you recognize the effect that this is having on you and the people around you and that it doesn't have to be so there is another way, but we first have to see. Yeah. Yeah. And that's, what's happening here with a reading the law for some of them. They, they didn't see. Now I just want to pause a little bit. If I can as well, little side note, and I've done this already several times is, if you've heard of this podcast before you've heard me speak on Sunday and we heard John speak on Sunday is that we understand there's something a little bit different between an old Testament follower of God and a new Testament follower of God. Every new Testament believer has the very spirit of God in them, the Holy Spirit. That wasn't the case in the old Testament. And so there was this necessity at some levels to hear the truth, the words of God verbally spoken from Ezra. Now we have copies of scripture. We should engage them. But for the believer now in the new Testament age, we don't always have to, even though it's amazing to go back in scripture and find it and read it. We have the very spirit of guidance right now. We can just ask, we can just ask. And that's why we invite you to do that all the time. Ask God because his spirit is in us as believers, guiding us, directing us, loving us, comforting us, advocating us. And yes, one of the things that it does is convict it. He, pardon my wrong use of pronouns there, he convicts us. And so we invite him into that, but we won't invite him into that if we have a misunderstanding of when we invite him in, what his purpose is. And so just to clarify some of what God will do and won't do in this space, he will convict, he will not condemn. And that's fundamentally different. Conviction draws us closer to God. Condemnation just makes us want to run away. And that's never his desire. And so if it feels like God's bringing stuff up and you want to run, that's not his heart. And that may not even be him. That may just be the enemy trying to pile on. God's desire is to illuminate, let there be light. Let us see clearly, not to belabor, not to dredge up the same things again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again. And to help us be more self-aware, not to become self-hating. And like we said before, it's through this place of conviction. It's through this place of being able to see, perhaps for the first time, see clearly that we get to experience something truly amazing, not just know it, but experience it, which is God's forgiveness. And experiencing God's forgiveness can change your heart towards God in a way that nothing else can. And it's an uncomfortable place to get to because some of us struggle to say, I'm sorry. Some of us struggle to ask for forgiveness. And knowing when we have wronged another human being and have to ask for forgiveness and be the recipient of it, to be the recipient of heartfelt forgiveness . Yes, you hurt me and I forgive you. I don't just say it's okay. I don't just say it didn't matter, but I say, yes, it hurt. And I'm choosing to forgive you. That is a powerful human to human interaction. That interaction between us and God, that'll do stuff in you that nothing else will. Well, you mentioned the interaction in, in, in the next podcast, because when we get to the next section, we're going to study Nehemiah, it's all about confession and forgiveness. We'll, we'll go even deeper into that, but there is a distinct relationship between our proper understanding of how much the God of the universe have forgiven us and our willingness and our desire to forgive someone else and ourself and ourself. Yeah. By the way, John said a couple of things here that if you've just like missed it don't miss that forgive ourselves, because he just said a couple of moments ago, this term self-hate and a lot of people like, well, I don't hate myself. If you can't forgive yourself, if you can't receive that, that's a sign of, no, no, no. You have a view that is not of God of yourself. And so just don't miss that. If you need to pause there and don't do anything else, a podcast pause there, say God, show me what's true about me, what I'm feeling about myself that isn't in line with what you feel about me. But you know, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I. you know, there's over and over again this example, you talk about Luke chapter seven, that this person been forgiven so many of her sins. And because of that, you know, a person is forgiven. A little shows a little forgiveness. A person who is forgiven a lot shows a lot. There's also another parable. That's the opposite. Um, in scripture that Jesus tells of a guy who'd been basically forgiven more than a lifetime of debt, and then he goes out and he doesn't appreciate it. And someone who owes him basically about a year worth of stuff, he beats that person, has him thrown in jail. The point of that story is, man, you really missed something in this. Forgiveness isn't really many times about saying, well, that person did more wrong to me than I did. So I don't owe them forgiveness. It's aligning yourself with whatever God is asking you to do, especially with, you know, horizontal relationships, other people, there's a real temptation because God never does anything wrong to us. Okay. He just, but people do. And sometimes we hold forgiveness and withhold forgiveness from people because we felt like, well, look at all the bad things they did. We'll probably jump into that more next week, but that's only robbing ourselves of what true proper forgiveness is. And in case you don't come back next week, forgiveness isn't saying what someone did to you is okay. Forgiveness is releasing the debt that they owe you to Jesus. And he takes care of it the way Jesus is most wise to take care of it. So I'm jumping a little out, but you know, I think we're. When we don't forgive ourselves, we're missing out when we don't forgive others. Um, because, you know, ask God, how much have you forgiven me? Let me see. Yeah. Yeah. That's a great question to ask. Just that very simple, very straightforward. God, have you forgiven me? And let that be a place where you allow yourself to bypass the intellect and sit and wait for a personalized response from God. Don't just go yes, because I know he has and not actually engage with him. Because again, there's a really uncomfortable place here of when you put yourself in the position to ask for forgiveness, there are some weighty questions that we ask in this life that even if you feel like, you know, the answer, like when I asked my wife to marry me, there was still like, I was 99.99999% sure she was going to say yes. But in that vulnerable moment of asking the question, there's this teeny tiny part of me that says, Oh crap. What if she doesn't? I've just now put myself out here. It's the same with this question. God, have you forgiven me? I am 99.9999999% sure that he has. But there's this little piece down here that goes, really? You know, there's so much that I think is good parallels in that you're talking about when you're asking Brooke to marry you actually haven't yet, but I'm going to tell the story on Sunday. Sometimes tears happen in weird moments. Like when I asked Kathy to marry me, she started crying and I assumed that was a yes, but I looked at her and I said, Hey, I'm assuming that's good, but I'm really going to need a yes because something inside of me, you know, I can tell you past relational trauma. I can tell you whatever it might be that brought up in that. And the same with God, but specifically I would go beyond that step. And I know you are as well. When we typically ask a question, there's, there's some depth to it that maybe not every woman gets. So when you say, God, have you forgiven me? Maybe it helps to be more specific. Have you forgiven me for blank? Because most people have that blank filled in. That's really what they're asking. They're not this blanket for sort of forgiveness. There's something that they've specifically, an act they've committed that brings up this question. The enemy goes, he can never forgive you for that. I mean, if we think about all the things that are happening for the Jewish people inside of the walls, they had significantly violated the law of God and God had made it really, really clear in the law. Don't do this. And this will happen. Do this. And so I think there's questions from an earthly standpoint. Can you forgive us for this? Can you forgive us for this? But that's the thing about God. God never breaks his word. He is, he, he wants to forgive us and we're secure in the fact that he always keeps his word and that we always, if, if we are his son or his daughter, we will always be a son and a daughter. That relationship doesn't sever. It may be higher quality, but I don't no longer become a son or a daughter. The people of God here, they were his people. The quality of that relationship wasn't great, but they were secure in the fact that they still belong to him as his people. And I think even sometimes behind the, am I forgiven? There's this idea. Do you still want me? Yeah, absolutely. Because if we're truthful, I mean, it's a question. If we have a lot of hurt that happens interrelationally between people on this planet, we may not want to hang out with them anymore. We never met and not digging into whether that's good, healthy boundaries or bad, healthy boundaries. Just, we just know what that's like. Yeah. So if we come all the way back up to the top of the show, we were talking about the importance of understanding of, of being convicted at a level of reality of this is the debt that I have owed and this is what I've been repaid. That there is something down in the space of forgiveness of, I don't know if you've ever not apologized or asked forgiveness because you weren't sure if the other person knew that it had happened. And so if I apologize for something that they don't know happened, now I'm outing myself. And so maybe I'm just going to wait to see if they notice and then I'll apologize. You can maybe tell by the specificity of that example that I may or may not have done that at one point in my life. But I think we sometimes do that with God forgetting that he already knows. And so there's things that we're reluctant to ask about specifically, God, could you truly have forgiven me for this? And one of the things that I love about the parable that you brought up from Matthew 18 of the unforgiving servant. When Jesus tells that story, he says, therefore the kingdom of heaven can be compared to a King who decided to bring his accounts up to date with servants who had borrowed money from him. And in the process, one of his debtors was brought in who owed him millions of dollars. What I love about that is the specificity. The King and the servant both knew to the dollar the debt. The King just didn't bring in the servants and say, whatever it was you owed me, doesn't matter. It's forgiven. They both knew to the dollar. And for me, that level of specificity has a profound effect on experiencing forgiveness because there's nothing that's been omitted. There's, there's no wondering of, well, I wonder if he knew about that. It's, he knew, he knew it down to the dollar. And he said, I'm can't, I'm, I'm clearing the whole debt. I love the angle that you're bringing at that. And angle is maybe not the best term, but the perspective, maybe that's a better term. Angle seems like it's a loaded thing you're doing. I think it'd be easy for a lot of people to go, the specificity is about making me feel bad. But you're bringing up the true point that specificity is letting you know that he actually knows everything and still willing to forgive. It's not, I think we've all been in that moment, like where we've been trying to resolve something and it feels, maybe it didn't happen, like this person is now going to tell you everything that they perceive that you did and you really did to hurt them. And like, wow, that didn't seem very enjoyable and we could put that on God, but that's not what he's doing. He's like, Hey, I know all of it and I still love you and I still forgive you and you are still secure. You're still my child. Yeah. And so speaking of that security, this is something else that some of us need to feel a little more of. Hmm. And so maybe some helpful questions here, and this will probably be the least illustrating we do in the most, the most of just posing questions. Where do you feel like you're on thin ice with God? Is that a place of reality somewhere in your heart or in your mind that you feel like, man, I'm just, I'm one step away from blowing this. Is there a party that feels like you could blow this up bad enough for him to walk away from you? Where in your life, maybe to take even an angle of viewing God properly as your father, where do you assume you're on thin ice with God if you can't point to it because you're looking at your circumstances and you are allowing your circumstances to dictate to you the truth about God instead of who God is. Again, I think it's really easy to say, well, I can't necessarily point to all of the things that I might be doing wrong. We're always doing things wrong. Man, there's a whole lot of wrong things happening in my life. So maybe I'm on thin ice. It's not the understanding or character of God. Go back to him. Ask him what is true in those moments. Yeah. Um, and I don't know how much time you want to spend on this, but I know for some people, this place of I'm on thin ice with God, and maybe there's a point at which I could do something unrecoverable that, that I could, you know, either if the sheer volume of the current sinfulness was brought into the light, or maybe I'm just a half step away from reaching, you know, maximum volume here. We're about to redline this thing that God might give up on me. Yeah. What do you say about that? So without getting overtly technical, but if you have that, I know that it helps when I talk to people about this, there are two places in scripture that people may point to and go, aha, one is in the gospels where people call the unpardonable sin and just want you to know it's not possible for you to do that. Here's what was happening in that particular section of scripture. A bunch of people looked at Jesus, God in the flesh and said, this, you are filled with a demon, right? They called him the devil, pretty much the demon possessed. And Jesus is saying, look, if you can look at God in the flesh and say, you're a demon, you're, you're, you're beyond being redeemed. There's no hope. You've seen it. You've spent and you've rejected it. Okay. So he's not here in the flesh that it's not even possible for that to happen. Right. And I will say this, um, there's another section of Hebrews, a group of people said, who's tasted of the heavenly gift, you know, and turn it back. Um, there's a lot of textual debate about that. Could I lose my salvation or not? My particular understanding of scripture is he specifically talking to Hebrew people who were God's chosen people, but that didn't make them saved. They knew what it was like to be chosen and turned their back in some ways, what we see some people doing here in Nehemiah. And because of that, you just missed out and you're not going to be saved. However, if someone, I will say this, if someone looks at that Hebrews passage and believes, um, that you can lose your salvation, um, here's what everyone agrees with, whether you believe you can, or maybe you can't, that if you lose your salvation, you're never going to ask the question, did I lose my salvation? You would have turned your heart so far away from God. You're never listening to this podcast. You're never having that question come up in your mind. I'm not trying to say it's the loophole or the way out. I don't believe that's what it's saying, but everyone agrees. Even if you think that's what it's saying, that will never happen. To me though, the one thing that just makes it clear is Romans and Romans says, I'm convinced in either height or depth or anything can separate us from the love of God. Anything's anything that includes us. Nothing can separate us. And that word separate doesn't mean that a relationship can't be diminished. It means change fundamentally who he is and who we are in light of him. And so if you've ever had that question, like all the things that I've done, all of that, know this, that God still wants a relationship with you. If you've accepted him as your savior before all of this, you're still in relation with him. He just wants to be in a better relation with you. If you've not accepted him as your savior, he still loves you. And what he died, he sent Jesus to die for you. He wants that. So again, if you have more questions, you know, we'd like to focus a lot in this podcast and be practically applicable, but there are times where it's very difficult to get into the application part. When those other things are there, just email me faith forward at CFC wire.org. I'd love to lay out the scriptures for you. We'll talk on the phone. We'll get together in person. If you're local, whatever it might be. You would love to just share some more about that. Yep. This may be a faith forward first that we've arrived at our last talking point with plenty of runway left. Yeah. I'm not sure how that happened, but minor miracle. Um, but this was the part, Brian, that you had said you were excited to get to both in the message and on this podcast is this place of going through conviction to experience forgiveness and the reality of our security with God, because the ultimate point was restoration. Yeah. Yeah. Luke 15, one of the, uh, more popular sections of Jesus parables. He tells three parables. The last parable is what we tend to know as the prodigal son. The son went away, blew up everything, John. I've talked about this on podcasts several times, I think before, uh, comes back and he accepts forgiveness from his father. He wants forgiveness and he wants security, but he wants security back as a slave. There was something internally about him and says, okay, I can take the forgiveness and I can take the security, but I can't take the position back in that way. And that's not how the father looks to him, runs to him, puts the robe on and puts the ring on him and says, you are fully engaged. You're fully, you know, you're still my son that hasn't changed. And I think there's a lot of us that sort of live in that tension to where I can't really live out my position as the son or the daughter of the King, because I've done all this. Yeah. I know he's forgiven me and I know that I'm not going to lose my salvation. I know that, but I'm, I'm always going to be in a scenario where it's less than full of what he wants. And I think that comes a lot of times because in that prodigal parable, the slaves actually for a moment had it better than he did the prodigal son. We was out eating corn cobs and pig slop, right? So relatively, relatively, he looks at as I still get better, but our better isn't God's best and God still wants, and that's just an example of extravagant love. It's an example of who he is and it's at his heart. And, you know, we just, we struggle with that. We could be fully, fully back connected and I get it. And so many of us have been through that, whether it's been a marriage or whether it's been a parent or whether it's been a child or whether it's been a friend that there's deep hurt has happened. It's never been the same, but here's what happens when we begin to think about God that way, we're going to miss out because hear me this, we are made in God's image. God is not made in ours. That means we reflect God poorly in some ways, but he's not necessarily a reflection of us. And so when we begin to get that backwards, we were going to think we can never, ever, ever be truly restored. And that's just a lie. It's, it's what the enemy wants us to believe to keep us from experience that. So you, you got some questions I think that we need to process. Yeah. And I think the most helpful thing to remember in, in the midst of all this is that this is going to be the rest of your life and that's not punishment and that's not your lack. That's just how deep this is that the invitation to be restored is the invitation to come home and then learn how to live as the younger son did as a son. And like you mentioned, Brian, we've talked about this. I won't say too much because I don't think you can talk about this too much, but we've talked about it a lot here that that son came home with a fresh realization of the way that I used to think about my father is not accurate, but I don't know how to think about my father accurately. And I don't know how to think about myself accurately. I thought I did. I thought accuracy was me coming home as a slave. That's apparently not the case because he's restored me to the position of son, to the authority of son, to the place of son. And one of the, one of my questions is I want to know what happened the next day. I want to know what happened when he woke up after the party and had to live in the tension of, is this the day I get beat up for what I did? And even if it's not, how do I live today? I don't know. I don't know how to do this differently and to have to wrestle with some of these fundamental questions and not just once, but for days and days and weeks and weeks and then years as, I mean, I don't know how you are with anniversaries. The reminder of how much time has passed since, I have to wonder what he was thinking on the anniversary of his homecoming, right? Okay. It's been a, it's been a month. It's been six months. It's been a year, right? There, there's a constant growing and developing and fresh understanding of what it means to be a son. And so even just some fundamental questions like, do you feel your father's love for you or does it just feel like he has to, that you know what the scriptures say, that you know that God, you know, before you were born, before any of us were born, desired to have us as his sons and daughters, do you feel like you just got swooped up in the net and he has to love you because he loves everybody else? Or do you feel God's love for you? Yeah. Do you feel like, as we've shared this question before, I remember Pastor Fred on our staff here. He asked me this question one time. It so caught me off guard. I don't know if you've ever been asked a question that just disarms you. He said, not, do you feel like, does God love you? Do you feel like God likes you? Like if God was in town, that he'd want to create some time in his schedule to just hang. I mean, not to sit here and let's talk about all this theology. He said, let's just sit down. Let's just hang out. Let's hear about your life. Cause you know, love is something we feel like God's obligated to. But many of us feel like, like is a different thing that he doesn't have to. Yeah. Like I'm not important enough. Um, I think that's, that's key. You have another question about, do you think you belong? Yeah. This one actually came up for me last week because as much as I feel like I know about sonship and I could teach about sonship because this is the rest of my life, I feel like I keep hitting places where I realize I don't know anything about sonship and this was the second of two questions that God asked me as I was out walking around on the paths out here near the church, as I was recognizing, I have more to experience in this place of sonship. And God's first question was, do you feel my love for you? I said, yeah, I do. Not just intellectually, but I feel your love for me. Same way that I feel it from my dad or from my mom. Like I, I know at an experiential level that God loves me. And his next question was, do you feel like you belong in my house? And I was stunned by the immediacy of my answer, which was, I feel like I'm welcomed in your house. But that's different because I know what it felt like to know that I belonged in my house as a kid. It was my house. It's my parents' house, right? I don't have my name on the, on the deed, but this is my house because I'm their kid. And it was interesting to watch my internal reaction of, I feel welcomed in your house, God, but so do guests. Yeah. Well, yeah, that's it. You took it words right out of my mouth. Do you feel like you have a guest room or you have your room? We have a guest room at our house. They don't belong there. They get to visit there. They get to hang out and they're welcome there. But any much past a certain amount of time. We're like, Hey, you know, we got to do something. But my kids, they belong there. I mean, my kids don't pay rent. They don't do any of that sort of stuff, but they belong not because of anything they've done, but because who they are. Yeah. I know there's a ton of imagery around this, but I mean, Jesus said, I've, I'm going, or I've gone to prepare a place for you. You have your room in God's house. You belong there. It's yours because he's your dad and you're his kid. And there's something in us that is growing into that, that is growing into the reality of our restoration, that we are actually his sons and his daughters. That you are his kid and you belong there. Um, my wife was at a conference a few years ago and somebody asked a similar question this way. They asked, do you feel like you have a seat at the table in God's house? And it was a really interesting experience that my wife described afterwards of talking with different people and how they had resonated with that question because some felt like, no, I have space in the room, but I'm, I'm serving at God's table and isn't that a good and holy and righteous thing. But no, I couldn't sit down at God's table and somebody else felt like they were under the table and not in like the playfully childlike way, but I'm not worthy of sitting at a seat at God's table. Keeping with the Thanksgiving imagery. If you're watching this, you may have just celebrated Thanksgiving. You know, growing up in my house, there was the adult table and there's a kid's table. Do you feel like you only are able to sit at the kid's table? Um, and it doesn't mean that you're not loved, but it doesn't mean you, you don't get to be at the big table. It was a running joke. We used to hear like, you know, the only way you get from the kid's table to the big table was someone had to die at the big table. Um, because you know, you could be there to your 50 in my age, right? If someone doesn't pass away. But I think a lot of people have the kid's table imagery too. It's like, I don't feel like I'm down here now, but if you don't feel like God's table is big enough for you, like, all right, he's got enough people there. His table's always big. And we're always not just welcomed. We belong there as, as children that way. And not because of anything we've done, you don't strive to maintain your place at that table and you haven't earned your place at the table. And so again, we walk back through the progression of today, starting in this place of conviction, of asking God to show us ourselves clearly, not to beat us down, but to remove our blindness so that we can fully experience his forgiveness and recognize just how much we've been forgiven and how much that must mean he loves us, that he wanted to do that. He wanted the slate wiped clean. Because this relationship cannot be violated. We are his and he is restoring us. We are restored and are being restored. You are his kid. And we now get to know experientially what it looks like to live as his kid, to belong in his house, to have a place in his kingdom, to bring him delight just because of who we are. And so as we celebrate this season of Thanksgiving, Thanksgiving, and then Christmas and all that we are grateful for, just invite you to hit pause and reflect on some of these questions and not just reflect without God, but reflect with God, spend some time with him again, not to create the list, but to experience the reality of his forgiveness, of your security in your relationship with him and of who you are and who you're becoming as his child. So wherever you are, thanks for listening. Again, as always, we'd love to talk to you. Email us at faithforward at cfcyr.org. And my heart, my prayer, and John's heart and John's prayer is that you will take what you hear from scripture, what you hear on Sunday, and not just make it intellectual knowledge, but allow the Holy Spirit to apply it in your life, to take your faith forward outside of a Sunday into every day, Monday through Sunday, 24 seven. Yeah. Amen to that. So until then, we'll see you next time. Happy Thanksgiving.
