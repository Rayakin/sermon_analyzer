Welcome back to the Faith Forward Podcast, John Ackerman, and joined today by Pastor Lee Towns, our pastor of digital ministry and story and the deliverer of this Sunday's message. So by the way, everybody knows, or at least everybody that's been watching this up until the last two episodes knows, we record this midweek in anticipation of the Sunday message. So we're doing a lot of this based on the assumption that you said all the things that you said you were going to say. I'm going to do my very best, but there's a lot of things to say. So we're going to dive right in. So as we always do on the Faith Forward Podcast, the goal is to make Sunday's message practical and applicable. Not that it's not on Sundays, but as Brian's talked about so often in many instances, we've just gotten into the, what is it and why is it important and where does it come from? And just about the time we want to get into the nuts and bolts of right, step one, here's how you do it. I mean, end scene and it's time to go to brunch. So that's what this space is for, practical application, next steps. And as much as we can, we also try to bring a little bit of personal illustration to this. So Lee, as we so often do, we remind people, this is not the Sunday message. This is supplemental too. And so if you didn't catch Lee's message from Sunday morning, hit pause here, I promise you we'll wait for you. We won't go anywhere. We'll stay frozen. That's right. Until you get back. Go check out Sunday's message. But we also know that sometimes people hit this first and for whatever reason, they refuse to follow the instructions I just gave. And so Lee, would you give us like the three minute synopsis of what you're pretty sure you're going to say on Sunday. So they have some context for where we're going next. So thanks. I will be glad to. So as you know, John, I love to talk and teach. And one of the things I love to do when I teach is right up front, go, okay, here's what I'm gonna tell you. So, so in a sentence, what I'm going to say Sunday, and I'm like 99.9% sure I'm going to say this. So in a sentence, the idea is that for us to be fully developed, for Christ to be fully developed in us, we have to shift our perspective from participant to partner. Now that there's a lot to unpack there. And actually, as I was praying about this particular part of the series, we're in, you know, retuning, I was, you know, I knew this was the topic that I was going to be teaching on. And, and it took me a little while to kind of land textually, where I thought God wanted us to be as it relates to this, not because the text doesn't say it, but because it's so interwoven, particularly in the New Testament to what God is leading us to. But as I, as I wrestled with it, and I thought about it, I was taken back to Galatians. And one actually one of my really favorite from a pastoral standpoint, really favorite verses is Galatians 419. And depending on what translation you read, basically, what Paul says is that I feel like I'm, I'm in labor, I'm having a baby, that that I'm trying to lead you into maturity. And so he says, I feel like I'm in labor, and some translations write it, you know, that Christ would be formed in you. I love how the New Living actually says it, you know, in a way that's, I think, a little more accessible. He says, until you are fully developed in Christ. And and then so as I've thought about that, and thought about, okay, the full development, you know, his anguish or his, his heart is that, as followers of Jesus, those that he was speaking to, and now us that are reading his words written under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, that that his desire is that we be fully developed, what's that look like? And so I backed up in the text and said, okay, so what is he, how is he framing that? And to me, I saw a very natural progression of perspective of thought, from thinking like a slave, as he starts the text with, to thinking like a son, which is something we love to talk about. Those, those two transactions, you know, are, if you talk about the talking points, those are the most common talking points relative to the Christian faith around the church, you know, so we I, we love the idea that he came to set the captives free, Jesus talked about fulfilling that scripture, and he did that work. But then we lean into, hey, he didn't just set the captives free, but he made us sons. And there's something powerful about that transaction. He didn't just buy us, which if you understand the context of slavery, for a slave to have a new master, there was a business transaction that happened, but he didn't just buy us out of slavery, but he actually said, I don't want you to be my property, I want you to be my child. And he invites us to be his sons and in John one, you know, the gospel writer says that to those who believe in him, he gave the right to become sons. He offered us the invitation to, to be his children, to live as his son. But then Paul goes a step further. That's those two comfortable steps along the pathway, but he goes a step further and he goes, and what he did for us is he put the Holy Spirit in us. And by virtue of that, not only are we sons, but he makes us heirs. That we are now owners of all that is God's by our inheritance. So there, there's a, there's a really fast recap of the message. There is a lot to say, there is a lot to say that was well done, that was well done. So again, if you haven't already, if you were hanging on like, yeah, I probably don't need to go back and check Sunday's message. You need to go back and check Sunday's message. I promise you won't wait. So again, highlighting the main idea here that if we are to become fully mature, if we are to follow this progression of no longer slaves and not only sons, but fully entering into this role as heirs, there, there's some practical steps and there are some things that we don't fully understand as far as how it works, but it's, it's, we've talked about this before. There's God's part and there's our part, right? And so we're going to hash out in a little bit more of the, the application focus, no longer slaves, becoming a son, living as a full heir of God. And as we so often do here, we're going to talk about not just deeper understanding of that, but how we've tried to walk this journey to the best of our ability so far, recognizing that we are still very much in process as well. So kicking it off with this first step, no longer slaves. I came across this quote, those of you that have watched for a while know my background is in history. I was a high school history teacher. This has been misattributed to Harriet Tubman. So it wasn't her, but it very much has her heart, which is why the misattribution happens. I actually don't know who said it, but I love this quote. So I continue to use it with the preface of who it's not. But the quote goes, I freed hundreds of slaves. I could have freed hundreds more if only they knew they were slaves. What I love about that is that it's so accurately defines the human condition in most cases that for many people, they fail to recognize their current condition. And even for those of us that have, there's so many words I want to use, but that have accepted the reality of who Jesus is and have believed in our heart and professed with our mouth that he is Lord and Savior. There are still places of bondage in us. There are still parts of us that are far more willing to submit to the yoke of slavery than to submit to the mantle of sonship. And so one of the places we want to start is what does it look like to get out of this place of slavery? And one of the questions that you asked in Sunday's message, which Sunday's message was very practical. So again, if you haven't, go back and watch. Who are your former masters? If you're already out and if you're not out, do you notice who your masters are right now? Who are your masters? Who are your false gods? Do you know? So talk about that a little bit, not just what you meant in the message, which you said clearly in the message, we're assuming, but what does that look like for you coming out from under the yoke of slavery? Yeah. So just for a little bit of context and then more practical application. So in the text, as I talked about in the message, there's two categories of slave masters. And the master has power over the slave, owns the slave, drives the slave. And here's the fundamental thing that I found in my own life. And I had to come to this realization that we all have a master, we do. And part of recovery is submitting a problem, right? And the first step in being set free, you know, in actually realizing the work that God has done is recognizing I've got masters in my life, not just one, I've got masters in my life. Paul does a great job of not letting anybody off the hook, right? Because there's the implied or maybe not implied, the more overt, there are the pagan gods or the pagan masters that are easy for us to vilify and identify, you know, from a Christian church perspective. And we would look at all of the kinds of decadent things that would be a part of outside the faith. Don't believe there is a God. So even down to alternate gods, right? So other forms. But then he also doesn't let us just go, oh yeah, that's for those that are outside the faith. But then he talks about the religious gods. And that's where it gets real practical for me. Having been born and raised, you know, in a pastor's home, spending really, I say this all the time, I literally feel like I was born at church. I wasn't, I was born in a hospital, but I'm pretty sure we went right from the hospital to the church. And so I don't remember a time where I wasn't at church. And when I was at church, I was just talking to my kids about this, that they don't even understand the way I grew up and they grew up in a pastor's home, obviously, but life has changed for pastors and church life. When I grew up, I got up on Sunday morning and I went to Sunday school. Then I went to church. Then I went home and took a brief nap and I came back to church and heard another sermon, sang more hymns. And then on Wednesday night, I came back to church, heard another sermonette, sang more hymns, and then went to my youth group experiences at a different time. And usually that was multiple times a week. So when I grew up and, you know, my pattern of going to church was four and five or more times a week. So I was deep into church. And when Paul starts talking about the religious practice, and I had to realize that church attendance, biblical knowledge, particular disciplines with great regularity and consistency, those became as much masters as the counterfeit gods. And a part of me understanding my sonship was understanding God's affection for me and God's value for me was not in any way, shape, or form influenced. It couldn't be increased or decreased based on my performance, based on my attendance record, based on my being able to pass the Bible test, you know, kind of my knowledge piece and, and, and it is, you know, we, I, I'm probably getting ahead in our outline for the podcast, but the temptation for us, once we embrace, you know, the idea that as a son, I'm no longer a slave and here's this master, that master, and this is, this is true of any false God is alluring. And so even when you walk out of that, you break that, okay, I'm not going to be held by the religious master. I'm not going to be held by the pagan master, whatever specific one it might be. There is that temptation to, to use Old Testament language to go back to Egypt and to return to slavery. So, yeah, it did something for you, even if it did things you didn't like, there were some things like, and so, like you said, the Old Testament language of going back to Egypt as Moses is leading the people out of Egypt and in Exodus, there's this, this faction that's like, but at least there was food, right? It wasn't even good food, but at least there was food, right? There was a place of known and security and relative safety, which again, all those things were illusion because you weren't safe there could have been killed in a moment's notice. The food was lousy. You were wildly uncomfortable, but there's, like you said, there's this allure back to but weren't things better when I got to do it my way. And, and, and the familiarity makes it seem like it was better, particularly when you're in a new setup and what we will do. And I think this is a part of what Paul kind of reveals as he's writing these words is what we'll do is we'll look at that master and we'll acknowledge that master really can't give me what I want. You can ask any addict that question, right? I mean, if you, if we just take it to a very basic level and say, let's talk about people who have, who struggle with the substance and are addicted to a substance. I've never met an addict that has said to me, and I've had plenty of conversations in this process of doing ministry. I've never had an addict that says to me when I get wasted, whatever that is, all is good. What they say is it erases my feelings, but it doesn't fix it. So they, so even at the basic level in the, in the height of addiction, we know that that God can't, he's powerless or it's powerless. It can't satisfy what I'm looking for, but we get lured back towards because at least for a minute, I didn't feel it right. Or, or whatever the other kind of dividend from that God is. So again, very practically, here's some questions to sit with, because as is always the case, we can say lots of good things here, but ultimately what matters most is what's God saying to you. Right. And, and so whether it's the, the pagan gods or the religious law, whether it's the things we know aren't good or the things we actually think might be good or good enough, the invitation here is to sit with God and start asking questions like, who are the masters that I'm willing to submit myself to? Who are the false gods that I turn to? And so just ask yourself questions like when, when, when the chips are down, when, when things are tough, when things are tight, who or what do I turn to for security, for safety, for comfort, for direction, for validation, for status, right? Because we all have something, we all have something we turn to. And I love the way you were talking about your, your growing up experience in church. And it just, it reminds me of so many times God says, it's about the heart, right? You honor me with your lips, but your hearts are far from me. As a man thinks in his heart, so is he, right? It's not what's on the outside that defiles you. It's what's on the inside, right? There's this, this repetitive thing of, it's not about what you do, but what you do matters, but what you do doesn't define you. And I just, this illustration came to mind years back and it stuck with me, two ducks on the water. You look at a duck on the water and they look like the most serene, most peaceful animal. And underneath the water, most of the time those ducks are going a hundred miles an hour. And if you're only catching the audio of this, my hands are going really, really fast, but probably not a hundred miles an hour. Right. But every once in a while, thank you, National Geographic, you get these underwater shots and sometimes they're still, but from above the surface, it looks exactly the same, right? The heart matters. The heart condition matters. What's happening under the surface matters. And so take inventory and invite God to show you, which for some people, that's the first and scariest thing, is that the God who already knows might show you that he knows. Yeah, yeah. And just to maybe interject something here, because I, one of the things that I'm always conscious of when I do what I just did, where I go like my knowledge or my participation, I bias that internal assessment because you start thinking, well, am I, is it, am I leaning on knowledge or am I, and you don't actually do the blanks, like going, oh, where am I really? Right. And, and what often I do, because this has been my journey, is I'll talk about knowledge-based gods. You know, I'll talk about my performance, my mastery of understanding, my mastery of, you know, memorization, that kind of thing. But I also realize, and I want to say this since I prejudiced the thinking that way, I also realize that there is a trend, and sometimes I have fallen prey to this, that feelings can be a god. And, and I can, it's not about what I know, it's about what I feel. And, and I can serve that master of, I've got to get that feeling. I've got to, so, so even in a religious context, I need to have a particular emotion evoked. And when that emotion evoked, is evoked, then I'm good, right? So if I can bring, you know, palms up worship or whatever, then I've, then I'm good. I've served that. But then I'm serving the god of that emotion, you know, and in the same way that I can serve the god of that information. So I just, I just want to make sure that when, when people are wrestling with where am I, you know, struggling as a, as a slave, what's mastering me, that I'm, that we paint the canvas with all the colors and, and not prejudice you into that thinking. So as you're doing that inventory, that's what I'm trying to say to you, as you're doing that inventory, don't try to think, oh, do I have the same gods that Leah has, or do I have the same gods that John has? Right. Where is it that I'm finding, as you said, my validation, my identity, my, my peace, my, you know, whatever, those kinds of dividends of following a god might be. And avoid the false equivocation too, right? I have these gods, but at least I don't have those gods. Exactly. Anytime at least enters your vocabulary in this space. That's a flag. Yeah, that's a flag. So good. And you know, one of the ones that just, it comes to mind for me partially because I've talked about it in this space before, but partially just because it's, it's literally today for me as, as I'm looking to this next thing of what would it take, what would it cost you to take that part of your life that is usually under the dominion of whatever false God, false master and engage with God in that space. And I'm not saying this because relative to others, it's, it's just, it's my today. Right. Food is the thing I turn to for comfort throughout my life from the moment of my birth and my family will tell stories on me every single holiday for the rest of my life, because they've been doing it for every holiday of my life. Food and I have had an intimate relationship. It's my source of comfort and I understand all the reasons why. And it is still something that I battle to be truly free from because when the chips are down, when I've had a long day, when I'm stressed, when I'm anxious, when I'm angry, I walk past the fridge. I kid you not probably 27 times in a day. Yeah. And it's, it's a battle every time. And so one of the things that God's invited me to into in this last year is a regular discipline of fasting every month for a week. Right. And I know sometimes fasting looks different for different people. For me, fasting is food. Right. And, and so this week is my fasting week. Yeah. And, and it's not a, because again, sometimes people get lost in the details. It's not no food for seven days. It's just dinner only right. Sun up to sundown. I was worried if I was looking like a Snickers bar to you. And, and it's, it's a necessary discipline for me in this ongoing departure from enslavement to one master to entering into true freedom in this space. And it reminds me today as I'm going through my day, I want to go to the familiar thing. Right. I want to go to the old place. And, and I, last night, last night I got to eat, right? Yeah. Last night I ate the food I'd set aside and then I looked in the fridge and I'm like, Hmm, I finally get to eat. There's some other stuff I wanted to eat earlier today that I'm going to eat now because now I'm allowed, right? And, and I ate it and it was so unsatisfying and there's like this poignant moment there again, as I'm doing the discipline, even as I'm practicing the discipline, I'm looking for the loopholes to go back to my old master. Right. And it's just like, this is a process. And this is why I'm so grateful that Paul points out the, look, this isn't just for those people and look how far those people are from God. This is the people that recognize who God is and still have these places in their life where they're submitting themselves to another master. And it's, and it's sneaky, right? It's, you know, you don't even realize sometimes that it's there. One of the, so two thoughts came to my mind as you were talking. One, that's the gift of fasting. That's that, that's what that discipline does for us. Exactly. It, sometimes it breaks the bondage, but other times it's a, it's the test, right? Shift the focus. Can I give this away or am I really leaning on this? And then the second thing that I was thinking about is the sneaky nature in which those masters take, come back and take control. And, and you know, I know for me, I'll come back and tell you my parallel to that. But I was, I remember reading about a noted counselor, um, a few years ago and, and he was referencing his sense of freedom, uh, to, to drink a glass of wine. And he said, so every day I'd come home from work and I'd sit down in the evening and I'd drink a glass of wine. He said, but then one day I got really convicted about it. That I wasn't coming home and debriefing and unloading the stress of my day to God and letting him carry my burdens. I was taking a glass of wine to decompress from my day. And he said, so I, I stopped because I, I, while I was not inebriated and certainly didn't break, break any kind of biblical laws relative to drunkenness, I was dependent upon that, which I think is the heart of the Ephesians five passage where he talks about, look, don't be controlled by something else that when he talks about don't be drunk with wine, he's actually speaking to a control issue. Don't let something else be your master to whom you turn for security, safety, whatever that is. For me, uh, it's, it's control that. And, uh, I, I know when my life feels like it's spinning out and I need to find balance before I inhale Jesus and, and let the Holy spirit speak peace. I master the moment I'm going to control it. And sometimes it's that God is so sneaky in my life that I try to preemptively go to that God. So, so I, if I know everything, I can decide everything. I'm the one who calls the shots. Oh, then I'm good. Right. But I've gone to the, the God of control. Yeah. Yeah. It is sneaky. And so again, it's not something that you have to be intensely afraid of, and it's not something that you need to obsessively self-analyze, right? You go to God and you ask, right? Because grace is still grace. Grace is still grace. Yeah. Good stuff. It is. So quick recap again, from the no longer slave section, sit with God, ask the questions, where am I still submitting myself to another master? What would it take? What would it cost me? And be authentic about that. Be honest because some of these masters are difficult to separate yourself from. What would it cost to take that part of my life and hand it over to God and walk with God? They're not just give it to him for a hot second and then take it right back. And then sort of with God talk through what about the temptations to go back? Yeah. Yeah. Right. Just like sometimes we rehearse conversations, not because we want to get just the right language to really stick, but because we want to be intentional with our language, right? The reason why you and Brian and Mike and Rochelle take the time to come up with what you're going to say before you say it, right? Because words matter. And so spend the time with God to talk through, man, this temptation to go back. What does that look like? Yeah. How can I navigate that helpfully, healthfully, authentically? Yeah. Yeah. And if you need to just hit pause there, that may be enough. That may be what you need for today. But there's more, there's always more. There's always a second name of this podcast. There's more. So you talked then about the transition from no longer slaves to becoming a son. And one of the things that we've already been emphasizing, and we're just going to hit the nail on the head here is that we don't become sons through effort, right? We become sons by faith. And that was some of what you talked about on Sunday. And so we talk about a little bit of this transition from slavery to sonship. And, you know, if that's reiterate a little bit of what you probably said on Sunday, but also what that's looked like in your life as well, as you've stepped out of the performance and the control and the getting to be a son. Yeah. So a couple of things, I've been thinking about this in this progression, you know, slave to son to heir, and maybe to is not the right preposition, but we'll use that for right now. You know, the work of being set free is a transaction that God does. And I know that's a progressive, as we've already talked about, a progressive work in our life to let God do that. But there's a, it is a work that God does like almost before we are even associated with it. He's done the freeing process. He's bought us back from slavery. It's with his blood that he bought us. But the transition to a son is a bit of a different animal. That this is where, you know, to a, to a large degree, we get involved, our choice starts to get involved. And I think a part of what makes this a difficult challenge for us is for most of us, we aren't adopted. And so the language of adoption and what actually occurs in adoption is a bit foreign to us. And, uh, but if you know anything about adoption, know anybody that has adopted, you know that there's this process by which the adopted child is brought into the home and the adopted child, maybe it comfortably interacts in the home, depends on, you know, the transition, but you know, in some situations they comfortably interact in the home, but that child doesn't identify as a child. And maybe something that's a little more relevant is to think about stepchildren because probably more commonly in our experience, there's the stepchildren. So stepchildren, for whatever reason, remarried parents and the process of adoption there. And, and in that situation there, maybe there's a warm relationship with the new parent, whatever they are, mother, father. Um, but, um, but there's certainly not, oh, you're my mom or you're my dad, at least not initially. But then at some point, some things occur that are emotional transactions and they really are emotional transactions, um, where that child is invited to own that step parent as their own. And maybe it means taking a last name. Maybe it means calling them by the, by the mom, dad title. But, and I think there's a lot of things that happen. I think probably the security that the, that the, that it's not just, I'm told I'm secure. I feel I'm secure. The love, not I'm told I'm loved, but I feel that love. So some of those kinds of things happen and it is far less cerebral and far more heart. Yeah. And I, and that happens for us in our relationship with God. His invitation to us is to be adopted as sons. I've given you the right to become my son, John says, and we can do a cerebral transaction and say, yes. Okay. Sign the dotted line. You're my father, but there is an adoptive transaction when we become sons, that is emotional, that we kind of let go of our resistances, not kind of, we do let go of our resistances. And I know for my own journey, you know, again, growing up, you know, I, I prayed the sinner's prayer when I was very young. I learned all the verses went to, you know what I mean? And I would, and I absolutely go, my journey with Jesus started when I was very, very young, but it wasn't until I was an adult and I was starting to own my faith that I started wrestling with this dynamic of, does God really see me as a son? Because I had a great dad. I mean, my dad was there, he provided a safe environment, he fought battles on my behalf, he loved me, no question about that. I mean, all of those things were there. And when I started thinking about that and going, is that, is that my, is that my relationship with Jesus or is my relationship with Jesus more about going to Sunday school? And, and I remember at a particular point, I think we're going to probably talk about this again in a minute, but I remember at a particular point in my walk with the Lord, I just had, and I, I often say it was God talked to me. Now, I don't know if there was an audible voice. Maybe there was, it felt audible. You know how sometimes those things happen and it just feels like that's real. It felt audible. I know it was real, but it felt audible that God just said, Hey, what if there was only one thing that was true? And that is that my promise to be with you forever. I don't ever do anything else for you. That'd be enough. And I remember having that sense of, is his presence enough? Like just knowing I am eternally in the company of the almighty God who is also the lover of my soul. And I, and that was a kind of a watershed moment for me in my journey because everything changed up to that point. It had been very performance based. I got to get dad's attention. I got to make dad proud. I got to, you know, and all of a sudden it was, Nope, he's given me his name and he's here always. And that's enough. And it's amazing how each one of us has to take that same journey, right? Nobody else can take it for you. And it's almost like, it doesn't matter what your story looked like because you talked about coming to faith early, growing up in church, and you and I have talked about this a little bit before, right? That was not my story. And yet I had to walk through the exact same process of when I did come to faith couple of decades later than you did. Although about the same time, because you're younger than me, right, right. I still had to work through this performance mentality. And in my case, it was after all these years, I now need to make up for. Yeah. Right. It's, it's, you know, if you caught, before we took a break for the summer, we went through a series called heartbeat, talking about God's heartbeat for his people. And we spent a couple episodes, episodes four and five in that series, if you want to go back and take a look, uh, talking about the story that Jesus tells of the father with two sons, which we usually label as the story of the prodigal son. But he's talking about both kids because both of them have missed the heart of their father and both of them in their own way are trying to earn their place or earn the thing that they want more than their place. And I so resonate with both because there was a long stretch there for both of us. A stretch there where I just wanted God to give me what I wanted and get out of my way. Right. And so I very much resonate with the younger son. Right. Just give me what I want and get out of my way and let me live life the way that I want to. And then when I came home, when I came back, it was with the assumption that I've always assumed the younger son had. Dad comes out to greet me and he is extravagantly kind and compassionate. But what about tomorrow? Is dad going to be the same when I wake up the next day or is the other shoe finally going to drop? Exactly. And what about the day after that? And what about the day after that? And should I just start living like my older brother who's been just doing everything he can to try to make dad happy, to do the things that he feels like he's supposed to. And that was the next part of my life with God of, I got to make up for it. And so I'm going to do the things. I'm going to start coming to church. I'm going to start taking classes. I'm going to start reading my Bible because I've got to make up for it and I've got to do the right things or else. And again, I didn't have words for it. I wouldn't have said this, but maybe he won't love me. Yeah. Maybe he'll stop loving me. I had the knowledge of already at that point, because I had read the Bible previously, I knew what the things said. I knew what it said about Ephesians one, like God, God wanted to adopt you from the beginning. Check. I understand intellectually, but there was a feeling in me of, but maybe not for you, maybe you're the exception. Maybe you are the adopted child, but you're not the wanted adopted child. Like you came in a, in a package deal and right. There's so much that we at a heart level have to walk through in this progression of coming out of our enslavement, which has been done for us and into this reality of sonship. And again, I, you talked about years in ministry. I don't have nearly the years, but in the hundreds of conversations that I've had sitting one-on-one with people, the overwhelming frequency with which this is, it may not be the presenting issue, but it's the foundational issue in most people's lives with God is, am I really his son? Yeah. Yeah. Or am I just the hired servant? Yeah. Like that younger son expected to. Yeah. Yeah. And I think the enemy of our soul continues to whisper. I mean, we know this, that revelation makes it clear that, you know, the enemy is constantly accusing us and he's whispering, you know, in our ear, you know, some lies, you know, and some of them are very subtle. And one of those very subtle lies is you were just bought, you know? And so you're the acquisition. He had to. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. His father forced him. And so, and you, and, and we live as an acquisition and, and if you, again, if you study the process of adoption, that's a part of the dynamic of an adopted child is they don't feel like they're a part. They're the, they're the misfit. They're the third wheel. They, they're the acquisition. And so they live as an acquisition. Yeah. And for, for some of them, and I think it's more often than, you know, needs to be, but, but they, they act out on that, right? There's, there's all of that because they are merely an acquisition. And I, and I think that it, again, it's an emotional transaction that I'm not an acquisition. He has made me a part of him. Yeah. That's huge. Yeah. I mean, that's, and, and, and there's not a magic bullet to that. No, there's not. There's not. There's just a wrestling with, am I viewing myself as that? And is that a fair view of God's interaction with me? Yeah. And do I see anything in my interaction with God that, that actually validates me feeling like an acquisition? Yeah. And that just takes time. It does. It does. And it takes intentionality. Yeah, it does. And I've used this example before in this space and I'll use it again because it's just so good. Um, the musical little orphan Annie. Right. She gets adopted. She gets taken out of a place where she was just a slave essentially. And she gets adopted by daddy Warbucks and they bring her into the house and they ask her this question, what do you want to do first? And she looks around through the lens of reality that has been the only lens of reality she's had for the entirety of her life. And she says, well, I think I'll start with the windows because then if I drip on the floors, I can get that when I mop. Right. She's stepping into the house that she's been adopted into by the man who is accepting her as his daughter and allowing her to call him her father with a slave mentality, with a slave's heart. And the only thing that undoes that is time. Right. You have to live your new reality. It's not enough to know it because they told her. Right. They told her, no, no, no. You don't have to. Right. You don't have to. And you can, you can see the bewildered look on her. Like, exactly. I don't understand. This is the only thing I know. Right. And so this progression out of slavery often looks like living as a son, but still acting like a slave. Yeah. Yeah. It's a, it's a subtle transition, but such an important transition. It is. Yeah. And there's more. And there's more. And there's more. And so the last thing that you brought up Lee on Sunday is not just sons and daughters, but heirs. Yeah. So we've only got a few minutes left, so flesh that out real quick. And then let's talk about that from a, a real life standpoint. Yeah. And here's the funny part is there's so much good stuff talking about not being slaves and being a son, you know, that all of that, that, that it's almost like we buried the lead because this is the lead. And it's why I love relations for 19, that Christ be fully developed, that you move even from being a son to recognizing that you are an heir, there is an inheritance for you. God didn't just invite you to live in the house with him and he didn't just invite you to share his name and therefore take from his estate. He actually said, I'm giving you the estate. You are now partner with me in the estate. That is a massive jump and it's a, it's a powerful shift when we recognize that, that in Christ, because of what Christ has done for us, we are not just occupants of the address, but we are owners of the address and all that is God's is us. There is ours and, and he makes available to us when Paul, when Paul's talking about in Galatians, he references back to the old Testament and how, um, we are inherit or we are, um, beneficiaries of the inheritance promise to Abraham and all that that meant. And that promise had to do with the, with the blessings. And there was an individuality about that, that as a child of God, here are the things that I get right here. I get provision and so I can ask him to, you know, meet my, my deficiencies, my needs. Um, I, I get protection. He promises to shelter us in the shadow of his wings. I get peace that passes all understanding that can only come from, uh, the inhabiting spirit of God. I, I get all those things, you know, I get forgiveness. All of those are the dividends of that. But if we're not careful, we'll treat it like we're shoppers. Like I'm going to go in, I'm going to get this and I bought it. Yay. I've got it and not realize, wait, this is mine. I own it. Like, like it's, it's all mine. The estate is all mine. And, and so there's the, there's the personal part of it that God says here, do you hear the promise blessings and the dividends of, uh, of living in my estate, the benefits of occupying this address. And then there is the collective part of it that, that we get to be partnered with him in the forward movement in advance of his kingdom. Wait, this movement is ours. It's ours. It's not, it's not just, oh, that's what God's doing, right? It's what God's doing with me. It's what God's doing in me. So I am a contributor. Yes. But I'm an owner. I, I have custody of this because I am a part of the kingdom of God. And as, as such, I'm an owner of the kingdom of God. Yeah. Try this one on for size. Cause the first time I said this out loud, like I looked around, like, am I going to get in trouble for this? It's not just the coming of his kingdom. It's the coming of our, our king. In fact, the Bible makes really clear that when he establishes his rule on this earth, we will rule with him, with him. He's made us priests. That's what he's done for us. He has given this slave who's been bought out of a slave or out of slavery, adopted into the family. Now I am an owner. Yeah. Yeah. Try that. Try that language on for size. Pause this and say it out loud and see how that feels. And like you said, Lee, this isn't just about shopping privileges in God's store. Because one of the things that you probably said on Sunday is that never gets old, by the way, um, that the greatest part of our inheritance as an heir is his presence, the seven days a week, 24 hours a day presence. And I love that you said that. And I love how challenging that statement can become. And so here's another practical thing. Ask yourself that question. Does that feel true? That the greatest thing that God could give you as his kid is his presence. Or, and be honest, not cause you're going to get in trouble, but because honesty is how we come to a level of awareness and change about this, is there something else in this moment you'd rather God give you than his presence? And I can faithfully and honestly answer that question in the affirmative any number of times in my life, probably up to, and including in the last month of God, there is something other than you that I would gladly take right now. Temporary pleasures are alluring. Yeah, it is. It is. And it's a really helpful diagnostic tool for us of in this moment, God, what are the things that I'm wanting from you instead of with you? What are the things that I think I need to do for you instead of with you? And just sit with that for a minute and see what surfaces. Yeah. And it begs a couple other questions too that if, not if, because we are, but since we are adopted and not only co-heirs, but co-rulers, you've not only been given ownership, but you've been given the gifts, the abilities, the tools, the equipping to be a fabulous co-owner, do you know what those are? Is that a space you've sat in with God? Right. Do you know what he gave you? Not just adoption and not just, you know, if we go back to the story of the two sons, not just the ring and the robe, but he's gifted you. You talked about the different places where the scripture talk about the gifts that God gives from God, from Jesus, from the spirit. Do you know? And I heard this fascinating anecdote in a book I was just reading about pastor pastor asked to, you know, people in his congregation, how many of you feel like you know, the gifts that God's given you? And he said about 10% of the congregation solidly raised their hand and he said, all right, of those of you that said, you know, you're pretty confident, you know, the gifts God gave you, how many of you are authentically and regularly using them? Right. He said about 10% of that 10% raised their hand. And he said, so if you do the math on that, that means a 1% of the body is living as co-heirs and co-owners. Yeah. It's, it's easy for us. And this is, I, again, we kind of buried the lead in, at least in regards to this message, but, but it's easy for us to go, Oh, I want to go see what God can do for me. And I want to go watch God watch what God is doing. And, and I, you know, I think about it, um, and I tell this story at the end of the message. So if you heard the message, I'm a little bit repeating myself here, but if they stuck it out this long, exactly. And, but I tell this story about, I grew up attending church, right. And I went, I got, I experienced it. You know, I, I, I know the dividends of that. Well, then when I became of age, I went to work for a church and my perspective, the church changed, not negative or positive. It just changed, you know, it was, it was a place I went and did work and, and as a worker in the church, I obviously cared more about the local, that particular local church where I was employed than I did when I attended that church. Right. Um, but I had this ability as a worker in the church to go, but, um, the day is done. My job is over, whatever got done, got done. And if it didn't get done, you know, that's somebody else's, but then I church planted and it's a wild phenomenon that very few people experience, but church planting is like being the owner of the business and the owner of the business doesn't walk out of the business at five o'clock and go, he's done punch the clock. I'm out the owner of the business lives with that all the time. Right. You're right. And, and if it needs to get done, you know, the owner of the business does it. And if it doesn't get done well, then the owner of the business finds a way to get it done. Right. And, and there's a, there's a whole different level of engagement and as a church planter, you know, that was a different level of engagement and, and it was not about my busyness, you know, with the lesson I learned from that was not about how busy could I be or how many different things could I do, but my view of my role with God in the forward movement of the kingdom of God was, wait, I'm an owner here and there is a different perspective when I walk in the room, if I walk into a CFC or whatever church I happen to be a part of that, if when I walk into that place, there's a different perspective. If I own it, if I am a partner in this movement, then if I attend and, and I think the invitation at the end of the day by God to us as heirs is I've given you to use Liam Neeson words, I've given you a unique set of skills and I've given you a unique set of abilities, a unique set of gifts and you need to walk in the room and own that. You have to do this because this movement is you. Yeah. Now we could come back and talk about, can this happen without us and that kind of thing, but, but for the purpose of our understanding of our perspective that we walk in, it's not about controlling the organization of a local entity. It's about my involvement. Let me say it again in case you've missed it. Cause we've said it a lot, but I want to say it again. It's about my ownership and partnership in the forward movement of the kingdom of God, not necessarily in the management of the business of the local church. While that may be up for debate and conversation, what I'm talking about is as an heir, the forward movement of the kingdom of God, I and you are partners in, that is a gift God has given us. And this is not the part where we finally legitimize busyness. No, it's not about that. It's not about what we do, because God's pretty clear. He doesn't need us to do anything. This is about discovering the reality of who we are and who he is and the reality of his kingdom. And the only way that we unlock that is by doing right. We don't do to become right. We do because we are exactly. And so Jesus even gives some pretty helpful advice here of. Be faithful in the small things, right? Right. Start with what you have, unless God is absolutely telling you to go out and plan a church right now. Today, maybe don't start there. And if he is, I would love to talk to you, you may be, but again, it's start where you are, start small, be faithful in the small things and discover who you are as you begin to be faithful in the small things. And one of the things I've been amazed at is. Again, it's still hits on my performance mentality, but I'm supposed to be doing more. I'm supposed to be doing as much as I can. And just how often God is not only pleased with what I consider to be small things, but how much I learn about who I truly am and who he truly is and how his kingdom truly works so that when it's time to do the next thing with him, not for him, but with him, I do it differently than I did the last thing. And not just because skills have grown or talents have been honed, but because I'm different and I see him more clearly and I see how the kingdom works more clearly. And so I am becoming different as I do. Right. And, you know, I did a couple of very practical walkouts at the end of the message and they come back here for this conversation. One, choose to live. Okay. I'm gonna say my seven days a week, 24 hours a day, your spiritual life. Yep. It's just so easy to go, Oh, Sunday I'm spiritual. And then I do my other thing and we compartmentalize it. So that's a choice we make. I'm going to, I'm going to be spiritual when I'm in the building and when I'm outside the building. Yeah. Secondly, choose to be public because the other temptation is, well, this is an internal private thing and it doesn't have external expression, but being a partner in the kingdom of God does have external impression. And I want to be careful. That doesn't mean you stand on the streets corner and preach. Not that some people aren't supposed to do that, but that's not the implication of that. It is. I'm living my life guided by the Holy Spirit directing me and the principles that the Bible clearly outlines for me. And I'm going to live publicly as a spirit filled, spirit directed person. And then thirdly, take the time to figure out your unique design and develop it and engage it, get out of the seats and into the game. Yeah. Yeah. The kingdom isn't a compartment. No, it's a realm and it's a reality. Yeah. And, and, you know, you're a history guy, you know, this, every great movement was led by people who were consumed with the cause. Yeah. We are a part of a movement. Yeah, we are. Lee, it's always fun to talk with you, my friend. Thank you for this. And thank you to all of you for, as I say so often, thank you for allowing us to be a part of your journey. Thank you for the privilege of this space to share our journeys with you. And thank you for allowing us to be part of yours. So until the next time, we'll see you.
