Welcome back to the Faith Forward Podcast, John Ackerman, Brian Bales, and we're in week seven of this series called For Something Greater as we're going through the book of Nehemiah. So, I'm not going to do the recap because honestly, each week it gets tougher and tougher to recap more weeks. So, go back to the last episode. Well, it definitely does build on each other. So, yeah, there's no doubt. So, if you go back to the beginning of the last episode, I did the whole recap of the first six weeks in about the first two minutes. So, you can catch that and then jump here if you've been catching these piecemeal. But we still have a couple of weeks to go, actually. Yeah, we do, actually. It's one of the things, Nehemiah, we're going to go about 11 weeks, give or take in that, and it's one of those books where I personally believe you could spend 1,100 weeks or you could spend one week. And that's one of the beauties about the Bible is that it is ever new every morning. I think one of the things that I've appreciated, I was trying to think about how many times in my life. So, I grew up in church. I'm a pastor's kid, which explains a lot of weirdness about me, actually. I grew up in church. So, Nehemiah is something that I've been familiar with. You know, I went to Christian colleges, seminaries, all that sort of stuff. So, Nehemiah is a book I've read more than a few times. But even in these moments right now when, you know, if you happen to be listening to this later on, we're recording this in 2023 in November, it's new. And that's the great thing about the scriptures, that the Holy Spirit is an active part at taking what's in this text and applying it to our lives, which, by the way, I think when we get to next week, a little bit of heads up on some things. And also, in this way, some of the weeks right now, we're just going to begin to understand there's something different between knowing the text and allowing the Holy Spirit, allowing God to come in and helping us understand the text and how it applies. And that's one of the things I've been hoping that's been happening over these seven weeks. And so, sometimes when people think 1,100 weeks, well, we could because that's how deep scripture is. Not just to, you know, know the Hebrew or the Aramaic, but to know the God of scriptures in our life. Absolutely. So, the brief recap I will do, though, is that last week you talked about the necessity of the crucifixion of our selfishness, that Nehemiah brought to the attention of the leaders of Jerusalem, that there were some things that they were actively doing, whether knowingly or not, that were possibly more detrimental to the pursuit of the fulfillment of God's plan of rebuilding the walls than anything that was happening outside the walls. And it required somebody showing them where they were blind, but then it required them recognizing this is correct. This is something that is not just bad, because that sounds like an oversimplification sometimes, right? This is good and this is bad, but that it was detrimental to themselves and to the people of God and to the vision that God had for his people. And so, as we head into this week then, it's not necessarily a pivot, it's more a continuation of when we begin this process of allowing God to show us the places we're blind to, when we begin to allow God to crucify these places of selfishness, sometimes that ramps things up rather than making things easier. So, talk to us about where we're going this week. Well, that was a little bit of my pause on Sunday when I went back to last week and said, doing something greater requires the crucifixion of selfishness, which, by the way, we can't crucify it. We can only lay down there and we allow the Holy Spirit to crucify it. So, let me just make sure that we don't miss that part. But then I stopped and said, how's it going? And the reason why that I asked that question is, in my experience, what I've discovered is there is a thought process that can come into our mind that looks like this. I am now doing what God wants me to do. I'm laying down, I'm asking him to crucify my selfishness. I'm trying to be more like his son, Jesus. I'm trying to be more like the person he has made me to be. And so, in that attempt, things should get easier. That actually happens less often than one would think. Because one of the things I said last week is, if at first the enemy doesn't succeed, try, try again. And even if we ask our selfishness to be crucified and we try to live that way, like I've asked people and hopefully we have this week, tried to live that way. As I talked this week, the enemy's relentless. He's not going to go, oh, there you go. You did that. As 1 Peter says, he's like a roaring lion, constantly seeking whom he may devour. And so, in some ways, it wasn't a setup on my end, at least not on purpose. I can expect that some people listen to this podcast who may have asked Jesus to do that. People who listened online last Sunday or came in person who said, Jesus, I want you to do that hard work in me to crucify that which is self-interested and selfish over and above your kingdom, your will be done in earth as it is in heaven. That has been a hard week. And so, you know, I think there's some value in pausing and recognizing that because it could just be that you've had this sort of hard week or you know someone who is, or you're listening to this in the future and you have a hard week and you go, oh, well, clearly this isn't working, maybe, but maybe it's the natural outcome of something. Maybe it really is. In fact, I would like to say, if you're allowing the Holy Spirit, it is. For me personally, like this week, I mentioned on Sunday a week ago that one of the areas right now that I just, I'm holding on tight to is time. There's a lot of reasons. I think some of you could relate to that. And there's some things inside of me that the Holy Spirit continues to work on and grow and to do some spiritual surgery, to use an overused analogy, so to speak. But you know, wouldn't you know that just this week, my time got crunched even more. Wouldn't you know that? I honestly, right now, feel like that God has placed an opportunity in front of me that he's asking me to do that is going to take up more time. And my natural thought process when I've been walking through this is like, God, if I do this for you, how am I going to have the time to do blank? And you've alluded to this on some of the other podcasts when we've been talking about the idea of rest and Sabbath, you've been working on a house, making it into a home for some long period of time now. And so God asked you to actually take a Sabbath on your Fridays when you're away. And it's kind of like, well, if I take a day off, this seems to be the opposite, right? And I think I felt that this week, like, God, if I step into this, and I did have this moment, like he's providing this opportunity for me, and immediately I felt stressed, which is interesting. I'm not saying that stress is always a bad thing. What I'm saying in my particular occasion, my stress was how am I going to get this done? Not is God asked me this, and he doesn't ask me anything that isn't for my good and his glory as I say over and over again, so that if he is inviting me into this opportunity, he's going to provide a way because here's the thing, God created time. He created it. So if he creates time, he can give me the time that I need in whatever way it might look like by taking things off my plate, making something be faster or some way I can't even think about yet. So that was the reality for me this week in that one particular area, and I don't think I'm alone in that way. So there you go. So before we get off and running too far, I want to pause on a couple of things. And the first is this, if you've been watching or listening to these podcasts for a while, you may or may not know that this is our 90th episode. So I was doing some thinking because one of the rhythms that we try to practice here at CFC is the rhythm of celebration, that there's no rule that says things have to come on fives and tens, but the 100th episode felt like a cool opportunity to do something different. So if you all are willing, whether you are a faithful listener or whether you're just catching us for the first or second time, what I'm asking is that over the next few weeks, because the 100th episode happens to land on Super Bowl Sunday, February 11th, and that happens to end at a time that we plan to be wrapping up a series called Better Together. Yes. And so it seemed like a really cool opportunity to talk about what being a part of this faith forward community has done. And so for whatever time Brian and I need to fill on that episode, we're going to talk about what us being a part of this faith forward community has done in us. Because for those of you that have been around a while, we do a lot of external processing in this space. But from you, what I would love to have happen, if you are willing, is to send me an audio or a video recording or just an email that we could read as part of the podcast of what being a part of this community has done in your life, how it's made a difference. And this isn't about elevating me and Brian and our contributions, but this is about what God has done in your life as a result of you being the kind of person that is actively trying to take your faith forward day by day, week by week. So audio or video recording, three minutes or less. I know that's unfair because we usually take 45 minutes. I can barely say hi in three minutes. But what I want to do is string together as many of these messages as you all send as possible to create the hundredth episode. And so if you send the video or just the audio because you don't want to be on camera, totally fine. It's going to take in its place. And I would love to just be able to create a hundredth episode of the stories of what God is doing in the lives of his people that are actively trying to take their faith forward. And then we'll fill whatever time is needed. Or we may not. We may just let that stand on its own. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, I had an idea. This is somewhat tangential, though, in looking. I think we should get matching hundredth episode flannels for that day. What do you think? Because if you've been watching or listening, you've heard us talk about we always wear plaid. At least one of us does today. John is rocking the plaid. I'm not. So it's I think there's maybe of the hundred, maybe five, five percent of the episodes, one of us is not wearing plaid. I like, you know, maybe something or coordinating, maybe not matching, coordinating, you know, something like that. I'm running out of all kinds of words that Kathy's taught me, like matching and coordinating. So anyway, if you don't know, Kathy's my wife. She is the one that makes sure I don't embarrass her in public by wearing things that don't match. Total side note as well. This morning, I like it. My son was not home this morning, which meant I let my son go to school with blue pants and a black and gray shirt and a red hoodie and red shoes. It was glorious. Nailed it. Because that is not going to be something his mom would let him in the house with. So I imagine when she sees it later on, I might be in trouble. So all that is free for you. Yep. Yeah. Enjoy that. So again, over the next 10 weeks, and we'll probably take a pause over the Christmas and New Year's Eve weeks. So no podcast during that time. So you got about 12 weeks in total. Again, audio or video recording on your phone attached in an email or write up an email and we'll read it as part of the podcast, but we'd love to share the stories of what God is doing in your life. Second, this is now totally changing gears. So if this feels like a hard left, it is and just buckle up. On Sunday, Brian, you as part of your message before you really dug into the meat of Nehemiah 6, hit the pause button and said, before we just move on to the next thing, let's sit with last week, we made space for the same kind of repentance that Nehemiah invited the leaders of Jerusalem to enter into. The recognition of their blindness, the realization of its effect, and the invitation to not just beat themselves up and roll around on the floor, but to repent, think differently about what was good and what was necessary and what God's invitation was to them. And so you ask people to pause and you ask them how they were doing with that process of crucifying their selfishness. And so it seemed like an appropriate thing to do here as well is to invite you to pause for a second, especially if you caught last Sunday's message. But even if you didn't, this isn't one that necessarily needs to be elaborated on significantly because I think we all know that we have areas of selfishness and the recognition that it doesn't just need to be managed. It doesn't just need to be moderated. It needs to be crucified in order for God to do something greater in us. How is that process going with you? And so again, maybe just hit pause on us here for a second and invite God to circle back with whatever he brought up last week or whenever you last listened to the episode. And when you come back from that pause, Brian, I was wondering if there was anything that you wanted to share with you. And I've got a couple of things for me about what that last week has looked like as we've tried to be intentional in this space. Yeah, I probably jumped ahead of this question a little bit earlier on in the introduction. For me, it really had been that what I've already mentioned, that time. That's been the thing. I do think as well, though, there are some aspects in my life and, you know, those who know me personally know I have kids. I have a 17-year-old and a 14-year-old. And I don't necessarily like to bring them up in the podcast because I want their life to be their life. But I have recognized as my eldest gets closer and closer to spending less and less time in my home, that there are some things inside of me that I didn't realize were there that I've got to trust God with. That, you know, what does it look like as, you know, they become older and you don't control everything in their life? Not that I did a great job of controlling it when they were 10, but I think, you know, there was some naive understanding of who I was and who she was and who God was when she was at 10 that I don't have now. And so I think, you know, those are some things even this week, like, do I trust you, God? So in some cases, crucifying our selfishness doesn't necessarily mean this idea of like, all right, I'm going to give up more time, as I already mentioned, it can just mean I'm going to give up my way of doing things. I'm going to give up. This is how it is. And stop and ask God in that moment, here we go. Ask God, you know, we always talk about this. How do you want me to deal with this? And he may say exactly how you want him to do it, right? And when I say deal, I'm not always talking about a negative thing. I'm just talking about life as, you know, decisions that are made. And hopefully, you know, I've walked in some shoes that my kids have walked in and, you know, statement, wisdom is learned at the feet of our mistakes, is a true statement. Here's another one, though, better wisdom is learned at the feet of someone else's mistakes. I want my kids to learn at the feet of my mistakes, not their own mistakes. But then also realize sometimes they got to bump up against that stuff. That's you know, I've got at least one child in my house that I like to describe as an experiential learner. I mean, they believe it in theory, but they really believe it once they experience it. And so that's tough for me. I've never been an experiential learner. I have either just disagreed and then showed I was wrong or I was on board. And so, you know, that's, I think, another one of those things like my way of doing things is something right now that he's trying to crucify. Yeah. Yeah. That's good. It's always funny when you listen to people talk about what God's doing in their life and you're like, wow, that sounds really good. And it's really easy to say because you're sitting on the outside of their life, not on the inside. Like I'm so glad that God's doing that for you. Yeah. Yeah. Please don't do it for me. God. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. For me, it's it's similar theme. And I think I've shared bits and pieces about this. I'm getting to the place now where I'm sharing parts of my life in so many different places on this podcast, in our Wednesday night class, in our Sunday mornings where one class that sometimes I forget who I've told which stories to happens to me all the time. Yeah. It's frustrating. But over the last several months, I've been a little cranky with God with some things. And it's not just the, you know, things that God's allowing that maybe are circumstantial or maybe it's his permission or, but it's things that he's actively asked me to do or to not do. And I haven't been a huge fan of the result because the results have been uncomfortable. And that's putting it mildly, but I had realized over the last few months that I was basically giving God the silent treatment, which was one of my unhealthy relational coping mechanisms from previous parts of my life that I have largely gotten rid of, except apparently in my relationship with God. And because I was cranky with him, I was giving him shorter shrift, uh, was still working with him. You know, I'd show up to work and I meet with people and I teach and it's like, all right, God, what are we doing? What do you want to say to this person? But I get home and it's like, nope, you're not getting my free time. You're not getting us time. We're not having date night. Cause I'm mad at you. Yeah. And. You know what I like to call that, by the way, I don't want to hop in here. I like the public versus private. Like, you know, I'm, I know I'm supposed to be this way in public, so I'm going to put on the Jersey. Sure. But man, as soon as I go home, that Jersey is coming off, it's going to the corner in the laundry. I don't have it to wear the Jersey right now. Yeah. Yeah. And so it wasn't just last week, but it's been really just in the last two weeks that it feels like I've turned a corner and it's not because God started doing something different. It's because I realized that just like in my marriage to my wife, Brooke, I have chosen to prioritize the relationship over my comfort and my rights. And I realized I had not been doing that with God. I'd been prioritizing my comfort and my rights such as I thought they were over the relationship. It's been a really nice internal shift. There's not been a lot of external change. But the internal shift of feeling like, and again, it's not that we ever stopped being close, but the enjoyment of being close has shifted and it required some significant repentance on my part of, God, I'm upset at you for things that are legitimately uncomfortable, but I am treating you poorly in the midst of this and it's selfish. And so it's been a good space, but it's also then been challenging, which is one of the things that you talked about this coming week is that when we start to make these shifts towards God or back to God, that our expectation is often, well, then external things should get better. External things should stop being as difficult. God should make straight our path, which means comfort and ease, and I can kick back and relax. And man, that is not biblical. And so in your message from this Sunday, as I was writing the podcast notes, I got all the way through it and the last line it felt like then reverse engineered the entire podcast because the very last line of what you're probably going to say on Sunday is what needs to change. In this life, when we've started to become aware of the schemes of the enemy, not only being active, but in some cases getting supercharged as we're getting closer and closer to being aligned with God and pursuing God and following God and being obedient to God, his attacks sometimes seem to ramp up rather than getting diminished. Yeah, it's, you know, one of the reasons why I subtitled this particular chapter Relentless because they are right near the end. All the walls are built. Only the gates have to be hung. I don't know how long that takes, but the point is we know it took 52 days, right? Some 50,000 people working in coordination to build three and a half miles and they were working hard. They were working hard in moments of just physical labor. They were working hard in emotional toil that it was taking in the tension between and the pressure coming from the outside. Some of them were carrying swords. I mean, there were so many reasons to say this. At near the end, they were most likely exhausted. If you ever think about long periods of projects or whatever it might be, the one that comes to mind for me most is when we physically moved the church building that we were at here at Christian Fellowship Church in Ashburn from one place about four miles from here to here. It was about three, three and a half years, and I was so exhausted when it was done. I didn't even realize how exhausted that I was. It was theory and then, oh my word. This is where they are. And at this point, there's this moment of relentlessness that the enemy keeps coming in at. And I think one of the things I'm asking that what needs to change was pointing back to some of the things that Nehemiah in these last couple moments experienced as the leader and the people through Nehemiah experience. Are some of those some of the things that are changed? I said a few things like he recognized the contradictions in what the enemy was coming at him with. He recognized his priority over and over. He recognized that he couldn't do this in his own strength, and he trusted God's ways, rather God's words and God's ways, not just God's words and then apply his ways. Certainly the Holy Spirit can bring in more things than that, but specifically as I was walking through Nehemiah here, it was this idea in chapter six around a lot of these are schemes of the enemy. And we've talked about this, that we wrestle not against flesh and blood. Our battle, believe it or not, Nehemiah's battle wasn't against Sanballat and Tobiah. It was against what the enemy was doing in Sanballat and Tobiah's life because God sent Jesus for Sanballat and Tobiah, just like he did for Nehemiah. But we also understand that we have an enemy that's relentless. First Peter, he's always seeking, always there. And there's some schemes that he has. And John, we've talked about this in encounter conferences that we do together. We've talked about in other places, following God's voice. We teach that class on Wednesday night and a little plug, if you've never been through that class here on a Wednesday night, I highly recommend it. It's really helpful for lots of reasons. First off, to understand what it means like to answer the question, can I ask God and hear an answer? Right? We talk about that all the time. But the enemy has schemes. And the thing is, over the years, you can begin to understand them and see them because they're not overtly creative. They're somewhat repetitive. But the truth is, they don't need to be overtly creative because they're really, really good. An analogy that I would use when I would teach this from time to time, I don't know if you ever heard me use this before, is there used to be a guy who played for the New York Yankees, the evil empire, so to speak, named Mario Rivera. He was, by the way, the first person ever elected into the Hall of Fame for baseball on unanimous ballot. First time ever. And he was a closer, which means he just came in on the ninth inning. And he had one job, get the last three outs. And he is known to be the best closer of all time. And the truth is, he only had two pitches, a fastball and a cut fastball. And everybody knew he had two pitches, but no one could hit him because he didn't need more than two pitches because they were so good. Don't be deceived that just because the enemy doesn't have a lot of different ways he goes at it, that they're not really good. Right? A fastball, cutball, whatever you want to say about that. And so what needs to change? How do we recognize these things? How do we not rely on our own strength? How do we trust God's words and God's ways? And so that was what I was sort of drawing us into in this moment. Because if Nehemiah would have chosen different paths and not recognize those things with the help of God in his life, who knows what it would look like? Who knows? I mean, there's so much behind each one of these that I didn't have a chance to dig into on Sunday and I won't do that. But I think there's some shifts that we need to be able to recognize with the help of God in our life. And those are kind of some of the things I think we're going to spend some time asking questions around over the last half of our podcast time together about what sort of shifts we need to make. Yeah. And specifically, the way that it seemed like you were nuancing this week's message was the fatigue that Nehemiah and the people must have been under after 30, 40, however many days as they're approaching the completion of the gates. And can I pause there? Yeah. I didn't dig into this enough. But I just want to tell you that if you are tired, that doesn't mean something's wrong with you. But it does mean you need to be on high, high alert. There are very specific vulnerabilities. And when I talk with men specifically about struggling with pornography or struggling with some sort of addiction, there are times in life where you have to be really, really on guard to those. And actually, I bring up at least three with men and all of them seem strange, but true. One of them say, if you're deeply hungry, one of them say, if you are deeply lonely, and the other one I say is, if you are deeply tired, there's also stress too. Tired is a vulnerable moment. I'm tired right now. And I told you pre-podcast, I don't feel very sharp. And so if I'm not coming across very clear today, I'm tired. And in those moments, we began to think thoughts that seem much more plausibly true than they're not. And that's why I see this sort of connection near the end. They had to be exhausted and he's pulling out all the stops. The enemy is through sand ballot and Tobiah in this moment to get at them, to make a poor choice. And so if you are tired, that's okay. We need to remember what Nehemiah remembered, God strengthen our hand, not let me look for my solution to whatever it is. So sorry for hype. No, no, no. That's exactly where we're going. And so if you're not currently feeling tired, right. And some organizations use, um, not just the HLT, but HALT, so telling you what to do. Yeah. We're so hungry, angry, lonely, tired. Yeah. I didn't even get on angry. Yeah. Yeah. If you notice yourself in that space, pay attention, right? You are not at your sharpest. And so everything we're going to talk about next is through the lens of recognizing where Nehemiah and the people were and what was making the schemes of the enemy potentially even more effective than usual. But that's not to say that if you're not currently hungry, angry, hungry, angry, lonely, tired, then disregard the rest of this because it's so much easier to catch these sooner rather than later. But if you're tired, pay attention. And these next few things that we're going to talk about may prove to be super helpful. So here's the first one, recognizing the attacks of the enemy for what they are and recognizing that the attacks of the enemy usually come in the form of contradictions and lies. So Brian, talk a little bit about what that looked like. So one of the contradictions that you saw straight out of the beginning was, is that send out until by a four times, send a letter to Nehemiah. Come on and come meet us like 27 miles away, which is a long way when you're going by camel or by horse or by some other beast of burden and you're not driving in a car and hey, we're about 27 miles from downtown DC in Ashburn, depending on what time of day, it's still a long way, a long time. You know, there's a lot about it that it just, it seemed clear it was a setup. Maybe it wasn't, but even if it wasn't a setup, even if they were trying to find a way to work together, the contradiction here came in this idea that later on, Nehemiah is going to call them to be separate from the foreigners of the land. And what that meant wasn't that people who were foreigners, God didn't love. I mean, the way that they were acting and those sorts of things. So a foreigner could become a Jewish person, you know, not by DNA, but by practicing religion. And so if Nehemiah would have then partnered with them in that he would have been contradicting the very law of God. And so I think sometimes we don't recognize that when the enemy presents something, if we take moments with the help of the Holy Spirit to look at it and we play it out, there's a contradiction. And I didn't get this on Sunday, but to see this contradiction, Nehemiah had to understand the law of God. And in that case, the heart of God already. And for us to see the contradictions in some of these, we really have to know the heart of God, the heart of God towards the world and the heart of God towards us, because otherwise those contradictions, they're going to come in and be seen really easy. Oh, let's do this. It seems to be able to do it. Or very straight out lies like, well, God doesn't care about you. If we don't know his heart, you know, things like this, or you mentioned one, I know that I fall easy to a lot, but I'm going to pass it back to you. If you just try harder, that is your solution to everything. And I want to say, it's not that we're not supposed to sometimes try harder. The lie is trying harder is my solution to everything. Yeah. And it's amazing how the enemy is able to interweave seemingly contradictory lies. And so that's part of why we use this word contradiction as well, is to set up two things that both seem plausible, that if you step back for a second and look at them, you're like, these can't coexist. Well, but it feels real and good in the moment. Yeah, it does. And so look at the effect of try harder, right? Try harder is a great carrot to dangle in front of someone if the enemy's using it, right? If God says, you know, you've got this, you've got this, keep going, keep going. That has one effect. If the enemy is dangling the carrot going, come on, just a little further, just a little further. Keep trying. He'll wear you down. And then as you're getting worn down with try harder, he'll often throw in things and especially if it resonates with earlier parts of your story, you're never going to succeed. Look at the combination. Look at the combined effect of try harder and you'll never succeed. That'll drive you into the ground. And he'll just stand there going like, well, job's done. You know, for others, it's, it's the relational contradictions of you've been burned before. And so there, there is an easy belief that comes in of people are always going to let you down. And it just feels so true. And it's emotionally worn you down that people have let you down, that people have rejected you, that people have betrayed you, that people have proven themselves untrustworthy. And then the enemy will throw in at the same time, this accusation of why are you alone? Why are you alone? What's wrong with you? Why are you alone? You know, get yourself back out there, but remember, people are always going to let you down. Why are you alone? Right? It's, it doesn't seem like it should work, but he has this incredible ability to put seemingly competitive or contradictory statements into our mind and into our heart without us realizing it. And then we begin to try to live out of the reality of them. And we're trying to figure out why we're so exhausted physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, and why it seems like we're not making any headway. And so one of the invitations is to recognize the attacks of the enemy for what they are. To hit pause for five seconds and try to take two steps back and ask God, what am I believing? That's not true. You know, Paul gives this, uh, this encouragement and admonition in second Corinthians two, when he's talking about that Satan should not outwit us for we're not unaware of his schemes. But if you go back to the previous verse in the context of the verses before in verse 10 of second Corinthians two, he's saying, if you forgive anyone, I also forgive him. And I have forgiven. And if I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven it in the presence of Christ for your sake. He's talking about this person that had done some wrong things in the presence of that community and that had previously Paul had recommended, get them out of here. It's not doing something good for you and your people and even for that person right now. But then as that person had repented, Paul said, you need to forgive. You need to forgive and welcome them back in so that Satan should not outwit us. Notice his scheme. Notice his scheme that there's a temptation here to live in a state of continued judgment. Notice that there's a temptation here to live in a state of, of continued bitterness or resentment or suspicion. Notice that Satan is coming in between people. That's one of his schemes is not just to come at people, but to come into the space between people and create division. And so, especially if you're worn down and especially if you're feeling like your relationships are worn down, that there's friction and fraying between you and people, take a step back and recognize the attacks of the enemy for what they are. I love what Paul is saying here in 2 Corinthians. When he's saying we're not unaware though, he's not, at least in my understanding of scriptures, he's not saying that we know exactly the scheme is happening at the time and we're choosing to engage in that scheme. He's saying like, we have intellectual knowledge of these schemes. The challenge is, is with the help of the spirit to recognize this is the scheme that's happening at the time. And so I think that's the challenge for all of us is like, we could go there's this whole thing and we could lay out a whole bunch of schemes in the enemy. Great. We have intellectual knowledge, but we've got to be doing what Nehemiah was doing, inviting God in this moment to give us strength so that we recognize that. I mean, let's use a football analogy. We are not unaware that this is a certain type of play or this is a certain type of defense. That's why they try to scheme in such a way in football that you don't recognize as that type of defense. You don't recognize as this type of play and offense, because if you recognize it, then you can do something about it. They have the intellect. So I want us to hold that. And, and what I think was interesting as well, before we got into this next scheme is, is that when that first request doesn't work, the next thing they do is they do an open letter. So, but here's the thing I want to get, I didn't spend a lot of time on this on Sunday. There's a contradiction here because the open letter threatened you're trying to be, you know, this, the scheme before they tried to partner with him. Now here's my point. My point is, is that if they really were doing the right things and they really were concerned about the King and the King thinking all this happening, they would have never wanted to partner with someone because then they would be a part of this and they would be a part of the people who'd get killed. And so recognizing that contradiction in the moment is what, you know, happened with Nehemiah. Oh, these don't work together. This can't. And so for some of us, I think, and I know in my life, the emotion of the moment, like, oh, fear, right? We talk about fear. Fear, by the way, is given by God. It's not meant to drive us. See, if fear would have driven Nehemiah in this moment, his reaction would have engaged in the contradiction. But rather, the reasons to be fearful that he certainly had, especially when you consider that 14 years earlier, the same sort of way of doing things had stopped Jerusalem from being built. So it had a track record of working, but instead he gives it over to God. He says, God, no, I know what you've called me to do, no matter what this happens. I know what you've got. I'm going to give this over to you and walk in that. And it doesn't mean obviously that there may not have been some anxiety. Text doesn't tell us. There may have been some moments where Nehemiah was taking a lot of looks over his shoulder. Text doesn't tell us. But we do know that he had to be able to walk in obedience to God, which was greater than the fear that presented in front of him. So there is a difference, and I think it's especially difficult in being aware, to tie it back, of the schemes intellectually and recognizing the schemes in the midst of what's going on in our life. Yeah. And so again, don't take this as permission for you to begin to figure out, this is what I think the enemy is doing. This is the invitation to ask. And the second goes with it. Remember the priorities. Nehemiah didn't decide on his own, I don't think I want to work with Samballot and Tobiah. I want to stay here. He very clearly was focused on, this is the thing that God has called me to, and God may eventually call me to try to reconcile these people with his people, but that's not what he's asking me to do right now. What he's asking me to do right now is work on the wall so that his people can be reconciled to him. So one of the ways that the enemy wears us down is with competing opportunities. God invited you into something, and as you stepped into that, it looked like there were 27 other good things that could be done as well, and the next thing you know, you're trying to accomplish all 28 things. The one good one that God said, do this, and the 27 other opportunities that popped up, and Nehemiah could have fallen victim to the same thing of, oh look, here's an opportunity to redeem some of these people that don't yet know God. And if I just spend enough time, if I give in to what Samballot and Tobiah want me to do, if I go meet with them, maybe they'll, using the phrase, I wonder if what God wants me to do is, mini soapbox moment, stop it. Stop it. Don't use the phrase, I wonder if what God wants me to do is. Ask him. Ask him, and he'll tell you. And Nehemiah had gone the route of, I wonder if what God wants me to do is bring these people into the community of God. And so they're giving me an invitation, even though it looks a little suspect, it looks like one of those phishing emails that's trying to get my password, I'm going to go anyway because I wonder if what God wants to do, Nehemiah knew what God was asking him to do, and not just a one time, not just a God said it once, and so Nehemiah is locked in on it, but he's constantly checking back, like, God, what are we doing? This is the priority. This is the priority. I'm staying focused on the thing that you not just told me to, but are telling me to do. I'm doing this first. And maybe something in your own life to just recognize, especially when you're tired, um, from doing the what that God has called us to, we want to shortcut his way, right? Oh, this email I got from the Nigerian prince, maybe it actually is. Yes, right. And, um, and it's not just the what it is the way it over and over again, you know, but to know that, you know, again, we go back to John and his, um, life in the, in the school system, the purpose of school, hear me, this is not a diploma, it is education. But if you think that it's about the diploma and the grades, you can cheat. You can shortcut the process. You can do all kinds of stuff. The way doesn't matter, right? Again, the purpose of this was not just rebuilding the walls. It was rebuilding the hearts of God's people. And so shortcutting the way is like saying, I'm going to cheat my way through high school, thinking that the purpose is the greats, but it's the education. And I think that could happen in our spiritual life, especially if we're tired, especially in those moments that were vulnerable, like, Oh, how long have we been doing this Jesus? Which again, is the point of God strengthened my hand from Nehemiah. Yeah. And we see the downfall of sticking to the instruction versus sticking to the connection. It's one, it's become one of our favorite examples, Joshua, right after Jericho, when they try to take AI, because they're sticking to the instructions rather than sticking to the connection and it goes badly. And then they recognize really the heart of the instructions was stay connected to God. Keep asking rather than we got, we got the instructions. And so now we don't need to ask anymore. I love the example, uh, not to demystify this at all, but thinking about your GPS that talks to you, it is interactive. It will give you the initial plan, but as you're along the way, it'll let you know they're accidents and they're different things you need to do. And what happens in our lives sometimes when we just stick to the instruction and not the relationship, we turn off the internal GPS of the Holy spirit in our life. And it's like, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa. There's some things that happen that we need to stop or we need to reroute. We're still going there, but you have turned off that connection. And then we wind up in the traffic jam or we get AI as what happens in Joshua chapter seven. And we're like, how did this happen? I got the instructions. Well, between the start and where you are now, you turned off the connection to me. And there were some things you needed to know that were vital information that would have affected this. And it doesn't affect where you're going to wind up, but it does affect the journey to there. Yeah. And I think that's it. So next time you're arguing with your GPS or you get it and turn it off, hopefully you remember that. Yeah. So especially if you're worn down as best as you can hit pause, take two steps back and ask God to show you the schemes of the enemy that he's using right now, especially when you're tired, think back on what God told you was priority one, and then make sure that you haven't just been sticking with the instructions that you, if, if the connection's been minimized, reestablish the connection. Yeah. Don't get AI'd. That's still one of my favorite phrases. And the next one is, as you talked about on Sunday, Nehemiah recognizing the source of his strength, remembering our part and God's part and not getting them flipped. And you specifically talked Brian on Sunday about the temptation sometimes that when God it seems like has given us something to do, that there's a pull on our end, hopefully not terribly often, but it happens to step into the space of bad things for good reasons. Yeah. It's what happens when the direction of the spirit is overridden by the passion of our flesh. We're very impatient people. I'm a very impatient person. And I think lots of times when it's very clear about God's heart towards something, it's very, very, very challenged for me not to put it on microwave when he may have a crockpot approach, mixing analogies, all kinds of ways today. But you know, I mentioned on Sunday, I won't go any farther than just saying this. One of the ways this shows up a lot in churches today is through the lens of politics. Listen, our gospel informs our politics. Our politics does not inform our gospel, but it's really easy to get that mixed up, especially when we would look at maybe particular political platforms or parties, and we see aspects of it that may reflect better than other aspects and the other platform towards the gospel. And so it's a reminder of our identity that even as God calls us into active places like politics, we are sheep, not donkeys, not elephants, and we've got to constantly be asking him, or what will happen is we allow our spiritual direction to be overcome by the passion of our flesh. And if we ever find a moment where someone from the outside looks at us and they would identify us first through an animal other than sheep, we are missing something. And I think that's one of those things that happens where it's hard for us to remember our part and his part, especially when we're like, I'm super passionate about lots of things. Life is so clear in scripture, so clear about how God said. But even as we step into some post Roe v. Wade, post that sort of stuff that happens here in Virginia and those sort of things, I have to be careful of making sure not only I'm doing what God has asked me to do it, but in the way God has asked me to do it. And I've discovered in my life, maybe it's true in your life, you're human, so it probably is that the bigger the passion God has put in place in my life, the easier it is for the enemy to come in and to take that passion and to do it in a different way. An example in the Old Testament is Saul. Saul, when he made the sacrifices, sacrifices were good. All these things were good, but it was supposed to happen a particular way through Samuel, but he wanted to defeat the enemy, which is all these things are good things. The problem was he didn't do it God's way and God called him out on that. And I think a lot of times the tension in my life, maybe the tension in your life goes back to fear. Like, oh, well, God's way, your way doesn't seem as fast, or I don't see how it's going to work, but he's still the God of the universe. So God strengthened me in my doubt, strengthened me in my fear to let your direction overcome my passion. Yeah. And this doesn't have to be, you know, big global or national issues that you're feeling worn down by and just wanting to see resolution, right? This is, this is very personal as well. You look at Abraham and Sarah and God's promise of children and after however much time had passed between the promise and the lack of fulfillment, they decided, you know what? We can make this happen, right? There is a, there is a way here where we can make this happen. There is another person present through which we can make this happen. We can do this out of our own resources. We can do this in our own timeline. And I think one of the things, and I know we don't want to belabor this too long, but I want to bring this point that you're implying in case they're missing, is that everything Abraham did with Sarah, with his handmaiden Hagar, was culturally acceptable, that the ends justify the means. There was nothing culturally wrong with what they were doing, but it was morally against God's plan and God's voice and God's ways. And when we begin in any of these places in our lives, whether it's something as big as politics, as big as children, or any other place that we want to put in to pay our standard is other people do it this way instead of what God has asked us to do. Then what has happened is we've tried to do a good thing in an ungodly way. Yeah. And that's so much easier to do when we're tired and worn down. Yep. Right. I just want it done. I just want it finished. I just want it ended. I just want to stop waiting. I just, I want it my way and that's not a bad thing, but the temptations that come from especially those places of fatigue often have effects that we will later on recognize were not what God wanted for us. Yep. So here's the last one. And especially when we're tired, this is important to remember. Remember what God is most interested in completing. And we talked about this last week. What is it that glorified God the most in this story of Nehemiah and his people rebuilding the wall? It wasn't the completion of the wall, nor was it the completion of the restoration of the temple. It was the restoration of God's people to himself that brought glory to God. And so it is with you. And so it is with us. And when we're tired, it's easy to get tunnel vision on the task and believe that the task is what God is most interested in having be finished and sacrifice whatever needs to be sacrificed for the completion of the task. And what God is always most interested in, more than the work, is the people. More than the task, it's his people recognizing the truth of who they are and who he is. More than the work and more than the task, it's the restoration and the renovation of their hearts. And that doesn't mean the work doesn't matter. It just always means there's something else that matters more to God. And the work can be done, and if it sacrifices people, that doesn't bring God glory. If the task is completed and people are further from God as a result, God does not get glory. And that's not his heart. His heart is not just for the completion of the work. His heart is for the completion, the restoration, the reunification of his people to himself. It's really hard to remember when you're tired. I think it is. And I don't know that I have anything to add to what you just said, other than to circle back and say, don't underestimate how hard this is when you're tired. It's hard enough. And so again, if you're not tired, great, awesome. Doesn't make the schemes less be there. Doesn't make them less powerful. It just means that there's a particular vulnerable place and the enemy is relentless and he will lie in wait for when he take his best shot. Listen, I'm not trying to glorify the power of the enemy because greater is he that is in us and he is in the world. He pales in comparison to the power of the Holy Spirit in us, but he is way stronger than we are. So it's got to be that reminder again, going back to him, God, strengthen my hand. God, strengthen my hand. That's Nehemiah's way of saying what we would say today, Holy Spirit, give me your strength. Give me your wisdom. Give me your insight. Let me follow. Because when he's saying strength, he's not just asking for physical things there. He's asking for mental acuity. He's asking for obedience. He's asking for help in his time of need, which is one of my favorite verses in Hebrews. It just says come. I grew up knowing the King James version there. Sometimes it just, it flows out better. Come boldly to the throne of grace. Come without shame, come with abandoned to God's throne and find mercy and help in time of need. And the truth is when we're tired, man, we need help. Here's also the truth. When we're not tired, we need help. Just living from that is part of the challenge. And so hopefully those are some of the things that you've been grasping when we talk about today and grabbed on Sunday and continue to talk about. Yeah. So friends, thanks for being with us all of this time. This is the 90th episode. Again, remember the invitation, send us the audio or the video, or just an email of what God's doing in your life as you take your faith forward. And I'm looking forward to sharing all those stories for our hundredth episode. So until then, he's Brian, I'm John, and we'll see you next time.
