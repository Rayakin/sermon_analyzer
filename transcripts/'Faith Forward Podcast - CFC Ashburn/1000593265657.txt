Welcome back to the Faith Forward podcast, John Ackerman, Brian Bales, happy new year. Yeah, we actually say welcome back. We've made it this time because we took a little bit of a break. Yeah. Like a lot of people did. Like a lot of people did. Yeah. Yeah. It's the holidays and that's what you do. And we know some people catch this much later or much, much later, but it's the first week of January right now. And 2023. But we finished off, you know, obviously the Christmas season, I spent several weeks just talking about as we do every year, which I know is always a challenge for pastors sometimes to find new significance in one of the oldest stories ever told. But as we launch into this new year, we do what I think often happens in church with a little bit of a practical shift to, okay, but now what, right? How am I supposed to live now in the reality of Christmas? And so that's where we're going. And we're going to spend the next several weeks specifically going through the book of first Peter. And for the purposes of today's podcast, and probably the next few, we're going to touch on first Peter, but also jump around a little bit in the scriptures. But as always on the Faith Forward podcast, the goal is to be practical, right? How do I implement this in my daily life? And so the focus on Sundays is going to be how do we live? And the focus on the podcast is going to be, okay, but let's really talk details now. How do I live? Yeah. And so as we dive into first Peter, as we did on Sunday, we're going to talk about a lot of things, but maybe the thing that's most on my heart to start with is to sort of diminish what I would like to say, the yeah, but now I want you to notice the words that I chose. I said, diminish. I didn't say, we can't say that. Because I think a lot of times we engage something in scripture and we look at it and we think, yeah, but this is my situation and this can't be true in my situation. This can't be true, whatever it might be. Yeah, things are different now. Yeah. I really want us to understand the audience. And it's not abnormal. If you ever engage a teaching in a book of the Bible, going straight through the book of Bible, it's a pretty common practice with a communicator, a pastor, a teacher, whatever you want to call them, that you kind of start the beginning of the book of helping people understand context, deeper level, who wrote the book and all of that. So first Peter was written by Peter to the power of the Holy spirit, the apostle. But what's unique about first Peter is that Peter is writing to what he refers to as the diaspora, and that are Jewish now believers all throughout the world, specifically in Asia minor, which is like modern day Turkey. But also it seems when he's using this term, while Peter was the apostle to the Jews, it seems he's just referring to even Gentiles who have now become believers. So he's talking to a group of believers and one of the major, if not the major themes of the book of first Peter is holy living. How do we live? And there's two parts to it, the benefit to us and the benefit to the world who sees it, the evangelistic, the communicative, the apologetic, if you want to use that term, to the world around us. That's the context. The piece that I also want to put more into the context is that we could read some of these things that we're going to go through over the next several weeks about how Jesus calls us to live, how we're supposed to do, and very easily go, yeah, but. Yeah, but they don't know the work environment I'm in, or yeah, they don't know the spouse that I have, or yeah, but they don't know how the government is blank in whatever. I'm just going to leave that blank for you to fill in however you might naturally fill into it. And that would be true. But however, the year of the writing of this letter is AD 64. If you understand your history, and John, you're a big history person and taught it for many, many, many years, AD 64 is a significant year in the Roman history. Specifically, Peter is writing this from Rome in AD 64, right around there is the time where there's this guy that you might know called Nero who comes to power right after Claudius, who wasn't really a nice guy himself either. So that all of this stuff about how to live was in probably the most pagan culture that had ever been experienced up to human history at that time. And I know we have a lot of challenges in our culture and that sort of thing, but I don't see us human sacrificing. I don't see us. And so I'm saying this to try to get it off the table that it could be easy from time to time to say, well, this seems interesting, but yeah, you don't understand my scenario. And I don't want to play the, oh, but yours isn't as bad as there. But I also want to remind us that all of us are glad we don't live in the realms of the ancient Roman empire where all of these things would happen. And so I just want us to hold that as we take this, because I do believe, and as there is in my life, there's going to be more than a few times where we enter a stage in this book that it's going to call us to do some uncomfortable things for ourselves and for the benefit of others. And that yeah, but is going to come up and it can, if we allow that to impede us or to buy that, it can keep us from moving our faith forward. So I guess that's what I would want to get off my chest to start this. We haven't done a podcast in weeks. I just had to get that off my chest. Absolutely. And I feel like that's one of the things that I think we sometimes forget is that the scriptures are not just meant to affirm what we already believe. They're meant to stretch us. They're meant to challenge us. They're meant to help us see differently and think differently about a reality that we don't always think and see, which is the reality of the kingdom, not the reality of whichever kingdom or government or country we currently find ourselves in. Well, and that's when we started. So when we started this study, interesting, lots of times you start at chapter one, but actually we started this study in the middle of chapter two, because the middle of chapter two is kind of like a thematic or key section that explains a lot of this letter. So it's not uncommon to start in the middle to give you that sort of context. And speaking of kingdom, one of the points that Paul makes it to, but Peter in this book, obviously over and over again is where's our citizenship? And so there is an urging, a calling in first Peter chapter two that we talked about, about how we're supposed to live. And then he says this, as aliens and strangers in this world, we jokingly called this series alien living. Some people may think of that more of like from a different planet, but actually how this was used alien living is anyone who, for example, it wasn't their home country. They were from another country. And we don't use that term a lot anymore in our culture. For some people, it seems offensive to call someone not from that country and alien, but it was a very fine term then. And so when he says we're alien and strangers, what that means is, is that this is not our home. We are citizens of the kingdom of God, first and foremost. Other people call it the citizens of heaven, same thing. That is what defines how we should live. Yet in this moment, we are sojourners. We are people, some other versions use that term in this world. So how do we live in light of a different citizenship in a different world? And having the ethics of the kingdom, having the living of the kingdom, allowing the Holy Spirit in, but it's really, really, really hard to do that. And that's the challenge. And so I use this term. I used it on Sunday from 1 Peter chapter 2. I haven't got to the rest of 1 Peter yet, but I'm imagining I'm going to say this again over and over again. The reminder of our true citizenship is key, but we often misunderstand what it looks like to be aliens and strangers in this world. One of the ways that we misunderstand it, and it happens a lot currently in our culture, is that we believe that being an alien and a stranger means that we need to be alienating and strange. We misunderstand the fact that Scripture says the gospel is offensive, and we think we're supposed to be offensive. And if someone's offended by the gospel, that's one thing, but there's lots of times the way that we interact with the world, the way that we show our faith, it's not the gospel being alienating. It's us being alienating. And so we're going to deal with that sort of tension a little bit. And as you said, we're going to be starting, though, about this holy life. And Jesus had a lot to say about it when he was on this earth, about this battle. Well, I talked about it because there is a battle going on. First, it happens over and over. Scripture has mentioned this reminder, you know, Ephesians, we battle this flesh and blood right here in 1 Peter chapter 2, there's a battle going on. Yeah. Yeah. So there's a couple of things that we wanted to touch on today, because as always, the goal is meant to be practical. And so on Sunday, you were talking a lot about how the goal is holy living. And that may be one of those helpful, not helpful terms. Yeah. We use that expression a lot. What does that mean? Right. Okay. What am I, what am I actually supposed to do? Give me the nuts and bolts, give me the checklist. And, and there are some things that are encouraged and recommended, but this is also not primarily about your performance. This is not primarily about the outward behavior. This is yet another one of those times where, as God says throughout the scriptures, this isn't about the outside, this is about the heart. And so this is not just about what you do, but it's about how and why you do things. And so that's what we're going to spend the bulk of our time today with this practical approach is as we so often do getting to the heart of holy living rather than listing out the behaviors that you're supposed to do and not supposed to do. And Peter does list out some behaviors and we'll talk about them. And for some of us, we'll be kind of like, Oh, that's obvious. But then we're going to dig deeper into that later on. Like, well, Jesus, again, when he says, you know, you've heard it say you shouldn't murder. I say you shouldn't look on someone with hatred in your heart. It's the same thing. Jesus does. So even these lists that we're going to go through, we're like, Oh, I don't do this. I don't do this. We're going to get back to the heart. Do we have the heart of that in us? Right. Yeah. And what was interesting for me, because the way we often put this together, if you're just starting to watch the Faith Forward podcast now as part of your, I don't, I don't know if this could possibly be somebody's New Year's resolution. New Year's word, Faith Forward, right? Two words. But, you know, Brian or Lee or Mike puts together the message that they're going to do on Sunday. And then I take their notes and draft up a podcast. Or John does a message on Sunday and then he takes his notes and still does the podcast. And so there's always a little bit of, you know, what's going on in my life? Where, where am I with God in the moment? And, uh, so for, for New Year's, for me, I was, I'm starting the New Testament in a year. And so I'm in the book of Matthew. And there was just so much in the first few chapters of Matthew that I've covered in these first four days, five days of January that really deeply resonated with that. And so that's, that's sort of where my brain went. And so if you're like, man, first Peter to Matthew, you know, what's, what's the jump? Oh, the jump is where I'm at in the scriptures right now. So there it is. Um, but there was this thing that I read just the other morning, uh, in Matthew three, it's, you know, it's talking about John the Baptist and how he's, he's in the Jordan, he's baptizing people and in calling people to repent. And as they repent of their sins, he baptizes them in the water. But then, you know, some of the Pharisees, the Sadducees, some of the religious leaders come and he has this, this pretty vehement denouncement that he offers them. And depending on the translation of the Bible that you use, it's equally vehement, no matter the version. Uh, but he says some version of you brood of snakes. Sometimes it's about vipers. Sometimes it's about scorpions who warned you to flee God's coming wrath. Prove by the way that you live, that you have repented of your sins and turned to God. Don't just say to each other, we're safe for we're descendants of Abraham. And I was combing through multiple translations because sometimes that's fun. And sometimes it just, it helps me see things in a different way. And one of them that I flipped through was the passion translation, which I'd only just recently come across in the last year or so. And the foot notes for this particular segment were really fascinating for me. Um, that as John says, you offspring of vipers who warned you to slither away like snakes from the fire of God's judgment. And he says this as he's in the river baptizing people, the footnote was John is telling them they can't escape the fire of judgment just by getting wet, that it's not enough to just mouth the words and get dunked in the river and keep living the way that you always have to not only not change the what, but to especially not change the heart that's driving the what. And so this was what got me thinking as we're talking about, as we're talking about holy living, right? It can't just be follow the rules. It can't just be do the do's and don't do the don'ts, right? Right. It's not enough to just get wet. There has to be a fundamental shift somewhere in my life. And I like to think I'm quasi-normal whenever I have approached it. You can make comments at faithforward at cfcyr.org. You won't be the first. Um, whenever I fall into that habit, knowingly there's some in time, but many times unknowingly in the latter parts of my life now, whatever happens when I'm just doing it that way, I find that I'm always let down because I begin to create this sort of transactional thing with Jesus. We talk about a lot that, oh, if I do this, this will happen. If I do this, this will happen. And so it is this idea that what are we doing and why are we doing it? I can ask both my children. I have one child that likes more order than the other child. I am of the order persuasion. And so when I can't overcome the lack of order in the room, what I usually do is just shut the door. But say that particular child decides to make their bed. They can make their bed because their fear of I'm going to take away something or whatever might be, or they can make their bed because I've asked them, and theoretically, I'm a loving father, right? All of that. They're both the same outward action, but where you get to see why they do what they do isn't immediate. It's over time. And I think in the same way, there's a lot of people who externally are making the bed, doing the right things, but over time, that's when you really feel, are you doing it just because you feel like you have to check the box? It's outwardly. Or have we really come into that relationship with God at the level that we do something, even things like this is going to ask us to do that are not comfortable, that we don't like, whatever it might be, that take extra time, because we love Him. And those would be some of the things that sort of play out because we can really even unknowingly fake it. We've talked about this over and over again. Matthew chapter 7 is one of the scariest parts of Scripture to me when people stand before God and they're like, oh, I did all this sort of stuff. And it's like, I didn't know you. What's God saying? No, no, no. You were doing something on the external that wasn't part of internal and that over and over again. And that's why, by the way, Matthew connects with Peter, because the idea of the heart, and it's written by the same person, even though Matthew and Peter are different people, they were both inspired by God to write it. That's the continuity of the heart over and over again. Yeah. And so, you know, the focus again on Sundays is, right, holy living. How do I do that? Yeah. And we see here in Matthew 3 that John is calling people to holy living, but the secret here is repentance. It's not try harder. It's not just do the do's and don't do the don'ts. It's experience a fundamental shift internally, right? Repentance is not just apologizing for all the things that you've done. Repentance, metanoia in the Greek is think differently and not just think new information, but fundamentally think in a new way about the way that you've always been, about the way that you've always done things, about, okay, this is what works, and this is how life is, and this is who I am, and this is who God is. Repentance, metanoia is allow all of that to be shifted in ways that you never thought before and think in a new way so that you're now acting differently. You're living differently. And so, just like you were talking about with your kids, right, making the bed, you know, the why matters. The shift matters. Am I making my bed for fear of punishment? Am I making my bed because I love my dad? Am I making my bed because I want to start to take ownership of my space and I care about my space, right? The why for the same action matters. It was much the same for me. There was a large stretch of my adult life where I felt like my money is mine, right? And I know the Bible says that I'm supposed to tithe or I'm supposed to give, but frankly, it seems like the church I'm going to is doing fine and I'm not. And so, God's a forgiving God, and I need to do what feels right, what seems right to me. And then there was this stretch where I was feeling, I'll call it convicted, but it was really just guilted into I need to start giving my money, but there had been no internal shift yet. The outward behavior was changing. And so outwardly, it looked like there was growth and improvement, but there was no internal shift. And then the internal shift happened. And sometimes it has to start outwardly before it happens inwardly. But then there was an inward shift where I suddenly began to think differently from the way that I always had about what this stuff actually is and whose it is. And not just in a way that I could pare it back from the scriptures, but in a way where there had been a shift at a heart level of, I can't see this the same way that I always have. There's been something that's happened inside. Thinking differently about the same thing, but in a new way. It was much the same with, as we dig deeper into ourselves, we discover that repentance, holy living is an ongoing journey. It's not a one-time switch because we continually discover new layers within ourself. God continually provides us with new understanding about things we've always done and things we've always thought. For a long stretch of my life, I kept the peace in my home, both as a kid and then early in my adult years, by just making sure stuff got done. And so I'm going to do the chores. I'm going to do the dishes. I'm going to vacuum the floor. I'm going to do the laundry because that'll keep the peace when I'm a kid. And so that just followed me into my early romantic relationships. I'm going to keep the other person happy by doing the things. Now I've stopped for a minute. There's a lot of people, if you're listening to this, who may be married, like, man, that sounds wonderful. But the point you're getting at is the motivation behind it. Right. The motivation was fear and the motivation was control. I can control my surroundings and I'm terrified of what will happen if I don't. And so again, through a journey with God and through a journey with my wife, Brooke, there were some things that needed to come out of, that's not reality. And so now the way that we take care of our home, it's not fear motivated. It's not control motivated. It's much more like that option of this is my home and I take care of it because I choose to take care of it. Not because I need to keep the peace in the home and not because I'm afraid of what will happen if I don't. Right. And the why matters when we're talking about holy living, not just the outward. And while again, even what we're talking about can seem a bit less than practical moving forward, it's at the basis of it because it's really possible in any time of our life. But I think let's pick the new year again. Don't know when you're listening to this, but all right, I'm going to change this. First off, we can't change anything. We have to submit to let the one job that we have is submit to let the Holy Spirit change us. And so know that, but it'd be really easy to begin. Give me the checklist. What am I supposed to do? And again, that isn't per se wrong, but what it isn't is enough. And so that's why we really wanted to start this foundation in there. And again, the good news is that you don't have to figure this out yourself. No, no. And so again, as always, we want to make it practical. And so practical step number one, ask God for help with repentance. And again, repentance isn't the list of all the bad things you've done that may be included in it. But the reason why those things get included in repentance is because repentance is what allows us to see those things for what they are rather than the way that we've always seen them, which were necessary, which were acceptable relative to other things I could be doing, right? Repentance is when we begin to think and see differently so that we understand how to live a different way. And so let that be practical step number one. You can't do it yourself. And so ask God, God, help me with repentance. And maybe you already know an area. God, help me with repentance in this particular relationship. Help me with repentance in this particular spot of my finances or housekeeping or whatever the thing is. Invite him to show you things that you've not seen, right? That's the invitation in Jeremiah. Ask, ask, and I'll show you things that you never would have thought before. That's been the invitation throughout. Ask, and I'll show you. You don't have to figure it out for yourself. So then, as I've been in Matthew, Matthew 1, and again, confession, Matthew 1, the genealogy of Jesus, I often read the way that I read sections in Chronicles, the way that I read sections in Numbers, the way that I read sections in, you know, you sort of yada, yada, yada, the scriptures. And there was just something about this particular time where I'd just recently been reading the story of David, and so I'd been through 1 and 2 Samuel, and then 1 and 2 Kings. And so this laundry list of good king, bad king, bad king, worse king, decent king, bad king, worse king, good king, was still fresh in my memory. And seeing that in the context of the genealogy of Jesus, that this is in his family line, I went back and I was looking at that list of the kings, and then looking at what was said about their life in 1 and 2 Kings. And there's this really interesting progression that seems to happen, where there's a couple of really good kings. There's a couple of really good kings, Asa, Hezekiah, Josiah, just phenomenal kings. And then there's some absolute train wrecks of humanity. Manasseh, for one, just horrible, just on par with Nero, like we were talking about at the beginning. And then there's this third category, and this is perhaps the most disruptive. This hits me much like Matthew 7. You mean doing good isn't quite enough? Because there's a couple of kings that are specifically mentioned, and I'm pretty sure I got this right, Uzziah and Jehoshaphat, where what the scriptures say about them is they did the good things. They did the things that were pleasing to God, but they did not tear down the high places. They did not go and tear down the altars to the false gods. They did not destroy the other idols that had been in use. They were doing the good, but they were allowing the other stuff to remain. And it's so interesting the way that section in the scriptures talks about those kings. It's a little bit of a yeah, but, but not in the way that we were referencing at the beginning, but it's doing good things is good, but. I think what it illustrates is a tension that we have today, and could be wrong in this, but I feel pretty decent about this, is that while we are citizens of the kingdom of God, what they did was try to live with a foot in each kingdom. And I think there's still very much a tendency of this. And so as we continue to move into this book and deeply, if you kind of fall on purpose or accidentally into a foot in each kingdom, there is no such thing as dual citizenship. This is going to be challenging because of the way that he is calling us and he's asking us to live. Yeah. And so for us to truly engage in holy living, for us to truly live holy lives, one, this isn't just about doing the do's and don't doing the don'ts, right? This requires an actual internal shift. And part of that internal shift, it doesn't just involve now forward, right? There is a, there is as part of holy living, a going back, and there is a tearing down of the high places. There is a removal of all the other things that we've looked to for life and security and protection, right? Because that's why those other idols remained. It was like God plus, right? It's God, I'm going to do all the things that you told me to do, but I don't totally trust you to come through with the harvest, with bringing new life, with keeping people from dying. And so these other gods were just, it's plan B. God, you're plan A, but you're not the only plan. And we do that. We do that. You probably, I'm guessing, don't have idols up in your house. You probably don't have a pole up in your front yard, but we do this, right? We do this. I do this, have done this, and there's still places where I have my idols that haven't yet been torn down, right? I've done this with money. It's God plus, God, you're going to come through for me, but if you don't, my checking account will make up the difference, right? God, I trust you to come through for me, but if you don't, I trust my brain to make up the difference, that if you don't come through, then I can figure out what to do. God, I trust you, but if you don't come through, then I trust my physical abilities, right? God, if you don't come through, I trust my words. I trust that my words can get the job done where yours don't, right? We have our idols. And so holy living is not just about doing the dues. It's about heart level change that helps us see differently, not just what's ahead, but what's come previously. And so, because of that, this call to holy living, we're living holy lives through the help of the Holy Spirit. We're then connected to and guided by a fundamentally different source of life, Jesus, the Holy Spirit, God the Father, in us being citizens of the kingdom. And then that result is not only do we actually know we're citizens of a different kingdom, then we're to live like we're citizens of a different kingdom. And that's when it calls it aliens and strangers. And again, going back to what we said, and this is where we're gonna get really practical in this time, not that we haven't been practical already, alien and strangers doesn't mean alienating and strange. They're not the same thing. And one of the things that I find is this temptation that, especially in the United States of America, so I'm assuming that if you're watching this, most of us live in the United States of America, and especially in what I would like to say, the American church. There's this conceptual idea that's going around a lot right now that the American church is being persecuted. All right, so I'm gonna step on some toes here. I might agree with saying the American church is being pressured, the American church is being pushed, and I would like to say that there are probably people out there who would like to persecute the American church. But this is what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna sort of grade it on a curve, right? So let's use a good teacher analogy. Comparatively, not just to what's happening here in 1864, let's just pick what's happening in China. Let's just happen in what is happening in some of the closed countries of the world. We're not experiencing anything like persecution. We are experiencing a different culture than what we've had. And I think in the midst of this cultural shift that's happening, especially in the American church, that it could be really easy to follow the temptation that I need to go from being an alien and stranger to being alienating and strange, and this is how it plays out. So I used this many years ago at Christian Fellowship Church. We did a series called Grace and Truth. Based on Jesus Christ, he said he was full of grace and truth. And I was trying to draw out this analogy of this teeter-totter that most of us are probably either more grace or more truth. We're probably not balanced super well, and Jesus was balanced perfectly, right? So he never avoided telling what was truth, but he was never mean for the purpose of being mean, that sort of thing. He also had grace. And so I started this series, and I just walked out. It was my opportunity to speak after some music, and I had had someone on our staff make something. She's very gifted with artistry stuff. That mimicked something I'd saw in downtown DC, and it was a big picket board sign with a poster board in the front of it. It had flames on it, and this is what it said, repent or go to hell. It was very quiet when I walked out with that. And this was my question, is it true? And the answer is yes, absolutely true. Then I said, though, is it helpful? Is that the way? And the point is God can use anything. He can. But in general, understanding one needs to live in wisdom and live that, is it helpful? And I think everyone in that room is like, no, that's not helpful. But without even trying, I think it's really easy in our culture, whether it's through social media, whether it's through that sort of thing, to become different versions of that, to where what we're doing is we are throwing rocks of truth. And again, if that is the last way to do it, we're to throw the rocks of truth. But that's not how Jesus led and how he did that. And so what happens is we pick up rocks and we throw it, and then people may call us names or that sort of stuff, and we think that, ah, that's a proof that we are living the way God wants to live because people are now persecuting us. And just because you're alienating and strange doesn't mean you're being holy. It may mean we're being unkind. It may mean we are being a jerk, right? How do we balance that out? So we always have to go back to God. So don't hear me say there are not times to stand up and wave the proverbial or metaphorical fist in the air and saying, this is truth. There absolutely are. But what the call for holy living is about first defining how we do things as well as the what that we do. And I think what happens a lot in our lives is we read the what's and we choose the how that we are most comfortable with. So some of us love conflict. We've never seen an argument that we felt we weren't invited to. Or couldn't win. Yeah, exactly. Others of us, we avoid that one way or the other. And that is more indicative of what our wiring is, not necessarily what God has always called us to. Yeah. Because there's some times where God wants us to be quiet. Sometimes we're God against everything inside of us that we'd like to speak up. And what I'm really trying to get us at is that we need to understand the definition of holy living comes first and foremost through what Jesus says through scripture and the power of the Holy Spirit that tells us how to do it. The what that it gives us in that way. And so there are some things that I think we need to keep in mind. And so that's why I kind of wanted to bring that sort of picture. And I still have it in my head of what it looked like. Am I choosing to tell the truth? These things live holy lives in a way that is more indicative of what I choose to do in my own personality and wiring first or saying yes to how God wants me to do it. And so again, a very practical thing that we say over and over again, we've already said once again, ask God, God, how do you want me to step in this? You know, and there are some things, John, and I love some of these questions you have that we need to be keeping in mind when we're living this out. Be more aware or be maybe aware for the first time of what our weaknesses and brokenness is. If you find yourself wanting to be really, really passionate about this aspect into our culture, that is wonderful. That's not good or bad, but there are other equally as bad things happening that you're like, yeah, I don't ever deal with it, or you don't deal with your own life. That's a clue. Not that you shouldn't be passionate about those, but why aren't you passionate about these other things? What are some things that we need to be aware of our weaknesses or brokenness? I know because of personal life experience that there are things inside of me that God's still working through that when I see certain things or whatever may be outside of me, that it just takes me to death con five really fast. And then I see other people going to death con five on things where I'm like, come on. And that's probably a good illustration of my proclivities, my weaknesses, and my brokenness coming before how God has asked me to live on a particular issue. And I also discover that if I begin to look at other people, and because they are not doing what I'm doing in the way that I'm doing it, if my first thought process is I'm more holy than they are, or they're less holy than I am, then that's again a point to say, what is this revealing? What do I need to keep in mind in that way? Because there are times where God is clearly going to call us to use our strengths. However, God is also in no way, shape, or form above using us in our weaknesses. Why? Well, when Scripture says, from when I am weak, you are strong. One of the reasons that God might often call us to live out from the how differently than we would choose to do it in our own strengths is so that when we live out from the how, there's no one else we can point to other than Jesus. And so I think that's part of it. And I think, John, you also bring up this point of fear in the notes, and I think it drives so much around this idea of holy living. And, you know, we've said this over and over again. Scripture says God has not given us a spirit of fear, so let's define that again if you've never heard us define that. God is not saying fear is wrong. God created the emotion of fear, right? If you're standing in front of a lion and you say, I don't have the spirit of fear, you're right. You have a spirit of stupidity, and you're about to be lunch. Fear of the Lord's beginning of wisdom. Fear of the Lord's beginning. That's a much more biblical version than I just gave. Thank you, John. You can send all your spiritual emails to John Ackerman. No, it is. So fear is not wrong. It's what you do with it. It's never designed to be controlled. We're designed to be controlled by the Spirit of God that sent us as believers. But I do think that when it comes to this holy living, if we're not careful, fear could drive how we're doing it over and over again. I'll give you an example of a way that I never thought fear would drive it. When I was young, I had this fear that if I did not say blank that I knew to say about God to someone at every opportunity, maybe just maybe that person would never have a relationship with God, and it was on me. That was a fear-driven thing that was even based on, oh, I want this person to know Jesus, but it was broken. It was all kinds of things that God could still use, but that's not how he wanted me to live. So if you find yourself living a holy life, what you're doing out of fear, so you could be fearful and be quiet. You could be fearful and be screaming. That's not the motivating factor, and again, and that goes into the heart thing that we're talking about, what's driving it, because I think there are a lot of people, now I'm back up, I know there are a lot of people out there that look like they're being brave for the kingdom, but actually it's fear-motivated. I know that there are people out there who look like they're being wise for the kingdom, but they're just not saying anything because it's also fear-motivated. It's just reality. It's one of those things that we have to be aware of our weaknesses and brokenness. We have to be aware of our fears, and then we have to be aware of our motivations, why we're doing what we're doing, and it's really interesting. I'm only going to speak for me because I'm the only me that I know. It really is amazing how many times that as I engage with people, they take what I do for a living, which isn't my identity. My identity is the son of God, but I happen to serve at a church, and I am a pastor, and I'm held to an account, Scripture says of that, but my job is not any more biblical than anyone else's job if you are called to that job, right? That's the key, right? But it's really interesting that there are times when I find that people want to motivate me almost manipulatively, and they're not intended to do it, and I didn't even realize it for a time. Because you are blank, you should be doing blank, and then you ask the question, are you doing blank? That doesn't mean I shouldn't be doing it, but you ask the question, are you also doing it? Those sort of things, and I think that there are times where our motivations, while at first glance are well-intended, but they're manipulation. We're trying to... And it goes back to this, when we're checking our faith, we're checking our actions, doing an ungodly thing for godly reasons never has the godly outcome that God desires. So that means doing a godly thing for an ungodly reason like fear or manipulation or out of a brokenness. And I know for some people are like, oh, is he saying not share faith? Absolutely not, not at all. It's this... Paul is... Peter, I keep seeing Paul, it's twice now. It's the New Testament. Yeah, in this context, he's like, look, there's a whole lot of things that are coming. Peter sat there and he was watching it. I mean, what was about to happen in Rome was half of Rome was about to burn down or more, and Nero, who historically we know did it, is going to blame the Christians. They're going to start being filleted. They're going to start all this sort of stuff. He's saying all of this is coming. You got to live different and talk about some motivations that we think, oh, why I'm going to speak or how I'm not going to speak. I'm going to do this. Fear of life is a big one. I think that will be a big one, and that's why he talks about this idea of living properly, because the goal of how we live in a couple of weeks, when we get back to 1 Peter 2, I'm going to talk about this idea of, I use this term, subversive submission. It works the opposite of how we think. The goal of this is to live such a holy life, one we know from chapter one we're going to look at next week, that it changes us, but also that people are in the midst of, and most likely because of persecution or whatever we're experiencing in the United States, a push or whatever it might be, to see how they live and to live so differently. There's got to be something about them. If I look at my life, and this is the diagnostic question, if I look at my life and the way I'm responding to a life scenario or persecution or whatever it may be seems to be fundamentally no different than someone who does not have the Spirit of God in them, it doesn't mean I'm responding wrong, because people without the Spirit of God every once in a while will act the right way, but it is a checkpoint to me, especially when we're under persecution or difficulty or challenge and those sort of things. That's why I says, so even if they accuse you of doing wrong, because you know, here's what's about to happen, they're going to be accused of burning down over and over again the church, and they're going to be accused of being cannibals because of the way they believed about communion. They're going to be accused of trying to subvert Rome by the way they looked at the freedom that God gave their families, but the freedom that God gave them as individuals because their identity was no longer Roman citizen or captured Roman citizen or slave, it was son or daughter of God. Even in the midst of this, you're going to have to choose to live in such a way that they have to still give honor to God. That's the challenge. Yeah. Yeah, we said we were going to jump all around the scriptures, and so I'm going to take us all the way back to the very beginning, to Genesis. There were two trees in the middle of the garden, the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and God said, one of those is going to kill you. And none of us, I heard a friend of mine said it this way, and this was one of those moments where I can't now but help think differently about all the things that I've ever thought. Adam and Eve had a way of thinking, a way of being, a way of living before they tasted the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, right? They were fueled by, you know, we said we're connected to and guided by a fundamentally different source of life. They were. They had the breath of God in them and nothing in the way, and then they ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and that became their power source. That became their lens. That became their decision-making paradigm. It wasn't what does God want me to do, it's what do I think is good and what do I think is bad, and which solutions seem right and which solutions seem wrong. I can figure this out. And this friend of mine said, all of us, unlike Adam and Eve, every single person thereafter is born with a Genesis 4 mind. However much of your life you lived prior to accepting Jesus and beginning this process of transformation, you lived with a Genesis 4 mind. You lived with a mind, a soul, powered by the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil, powered by you as your source of power and life and wisdom and everything. You had a lot of practice with that. You had a lot of experience with that. And so what all of us are now having to do is learn to live holy lives by plugging into the source of life, not by trying to live holy lives through our knowledge of good and evil. And so that's the fundamental shift that has to happen for all of us, is that the only way you get to live a holy life is if you become powered and guided and directed by the breath of God in you, by the life of God in you, by the spirit of God in you. And so when we're talking about become aware of your weaknesses and brokenness, a lot of that is, you know, just things that you've grown accustomed to over the years or decades of your life, but a lot of that is become aware of that piece of you that's still trying to be the little g God of your life. And that hasn't yet fully submitted that part of your life to the breath of God, the life of God, the spirit of God in you, that piece of you that still feels like it's all up to me, either out of fear or out of a desire to keep control of this crazy thing. And that's the shift that Peter's describing, that people are going to look at you and they're going to go, okay, I know they've been accused of some weird stuff, but there's just something about them that's different and not dangerous different. Well, dangerous in the way that it's unsettling, but not, right? There's something, I don't know what it is, but there is something about them that just makes me think there's something else going on here, that these are these are good people, not in the sense that they never rocked the boat, but in the way that God called things good. There is life in them and that life seems to create life around them. And, and I don't know what to do about that, but man, it's messing me up in the best possible way. And I got to know more. That's the holy life that we're being called to. I think maybe a way to even frame it is it's strange, but it's not alienating. Right. It's attractive. Yeah. There's something about it because you do look at it. I mean, there's nothing per se wrong about being strange, right? It's not the definition. It means you're doing the right thing. Right. But I do think when we talk about over and over scripture, go back to another John chapter 17, John chapter 17 in Jesus high priestly prayer about having unity. Part of why people were going to be attracted to God is that it is strange to look at so many different people from so many different backgrounds and all that walking unity. Like that's strange, but that's not alienating. I want that. It makes no sense, but it's undeniable. Right. Right. So, yeah. So friends, as we wrap this up for today, it's good to be back in the studio. It's good to be back with you. It's good to be talking about the personal application of all the things that we do on Sunday. And it's not that Sunday is insufficient. It's just that there's always more. There's never enough time to talk about all that's going on in the kingdom because there's always so much going on in the kingdom. You know, that could be the third name of the podcast. We said faith forward, ask God, and there's always more. We could, you know, say there's never enough time. Well, that could be true. It could be true. So as always, if you want to continue the conversation with us, you can email us at faith forward at cfcyr.org. We would love to continue to engage in your story and where you find yourself right now in this life with God. Um, but for now we're going to call this good. We'll be back next week and for the next several weeks, talking more about this book of first Peter and what it means to live this holy life and how we can do that. So on behalf of Brian, I'm John, and we'll see you next time.
