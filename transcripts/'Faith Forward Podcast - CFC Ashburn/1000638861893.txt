Welcome back to the Faith Forward podcast, John Ackerman, Brian Bales, and we have reached the end of Nehemiah. And to celebrate the end of Nehemiah, neither one of us are wearing plaid. It's Christmas season, which, you know, doing Nehemiah isn't probably what people typically think during the Christmas season, but I do think there's a whole lot of good stuff we've been talking about that apply at any time in our life, especially during December. Yep, absolutely. So hopefully you were able to hang with us the entire way, or if you've just recently found us, I mean, we're a little biased, but I would say it's worth going back and checking out the previous episodes associated with this series, because there really has been a lot from God's initial call into Nehemiah's heart to do something greater than he had considered. When he was already sort of at the heart of a pretty massive and successful empire, God calls him to something that was after God's own heart, but deeply resonated with Nehemiah. And so Nehemiah does, but he doesn't just jump right in. He learns how to navigate heart level desires with God, and then he goes back and oversees this tremendous undertaking of rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem. But then we come to find out that it wasn't just about the walls, that the walls mattered, but there was something else that God was after even more so, which was the restoration, the rebuilding of his people into his people as he has intended them to be. And so that took us all the way up through last week where Pastor Lee was here, as well as on Sunday, talking about the thing that God was after in the lives of his people at that point, and still in the lives of his people today, is the reordered life, following God, God's way. And so as we come to this week, we reach this really bad ending as far as we define it. Well, yeah. No, I think that's fair to say, and we don't say that sacrilegiously because we're not from an earthly standpoint saying God wrote something poor. But I will say this, when someone asks many times, how can you trust the validity of the Bible? There's many, many, many things that we could go into, but I really believe one of the very effective things about the Bible is the Bible actually many times ends in ways we wouldn't expect it. Like, if we were making up this story in Nehemiah, as certainly as Western Americanized or actual American believers, we would tie a bow on the end of this, they would have reordered their life at the end of chapter 12, and therefore they would live happily ever after. As every good Christmas movie should. Exactly. But, you know, there's no person coming from the big city who meets her old boyfriend, right? With the red truck and the wreath in this. There is reality, and life doesn't always follow the typical expectations of this is how it ends. And the reason why I go back to one of the ways to talk about the Bible as being something that is trustworthy is this does not end this way. If you're making up a story, you don't end the story this way. You end the story with it lives happily ever after, but chapter 13 is a discouraging reality that we discover. And in between chapter 12 and chapter 13, depending upon who you read or whatever, there's about a one-year to two-year gap. And it's almost like if you've ever watched one of those movies where it has an epilogue, where they go forward so many times and they look. In most of those movies, everything's gone well, right? You know, now the lady, she's got her life in order. They've got a kid. They own some little, you know, Christmas trinket place somewhere, whatever it might be. I'm thinking Sweet Home Alabama in my head right now, but that's not a Hallmark movie. That's a different sort of movie with the same theme, right? Oh, no, this is not. The best way to summarize Sunday was this, is that everything they promised to do in chapter 10, 11, and 12, they broke, they went back. And that is something that we began to deal with because I think that's true in a lot of our lives. Maybe not at the grand scale of all the things that they talked about, but I know, I know, I know in my own life, and I know if you're a human being and you're trying to follow after God, you probably have this experience as well. There's been a discouraging reality sometimes where we've gone backwards to the very things that we said with the help of the Holy Spirit, we're not going to do again. We made a covenant on our heart. We maybe wrote it down. We spoke it out loud, and there we are again. And so this week has really been a study and a look at what are some principles we can draw from, not just the first 12 chapters, but the last chapter, Nehemiah 13, about what it looks like to sustain the set apart life. What does it look like to continue living in a way that not just for one moment, for one period of time in 12 years was a good amount of time. That's how long Nehemiah was there in his first go around in Jerusalem, better together for something greater, but it is the lifestyle, not just a moment in there. And so that's where we ended our time together on Sunday, really kind of walking through that. We're going to talk through some of that today, a little bit deeper. Yeah. And so it's a really helpful reminder, I think, to one, be confronted with the reality that we are people just like these people that a friend of mine from high school said anytime you're tempted to complain about traffic, because this was in Chicago, remember that you are traffic. And so the temptation here is, as we look at this, how could they go back after just a year or two? We are people. We do this as well, but then not to swing so far to the other extreme of, well, everybody does this. Sure. So, you know, excusing, it's okay, it's fine. There is a middle ground here of we need to see ourselves clearly and we need God to help us see ourselves clearly so that we can actually live the way that he's inviting us to. Because that's the third way, as is so often the case with Jesus. It's not, oh, look at those people, glad I'm not that way. And it's not, well, everybody's like this, so what are we going to do? It's see yourself clearly and we need help seeing ourselves clearly because there is another way to live. Yeah. And so we're going to dive into that. Hopefully we teed it up. Before we dive into it, because we forgot last week until we got to the end and I jumped ahead. In fact, even just so that our listeners know, I always sort of keep time right here because when we record this on video, there's certain things that are starting to happen. So John, in case you didn't notice, I started three minutes late. I forgot to hit the go. So we don't want to miss that in the middle. Like we're just talking. Yeah, there it goes. So we'll try to remember that later on. You, if we do our job, we'll never have a clue this happened, but this is real. This is out loud. One of the things that we do know is that we're coming up on our hundredth episode. I don't exactly think it's our Superbowl, but it does coincide with Superbowl Sunday. So what are we asking the people? Yeah. So we've said this now for a few episodes and the request is the same. We've already had a couple of responses, which is exciting that people are hearing this and responding. But for the hundredth episode, we're finishing up a series at that point, February 11th about being better together. And that's really what this Faith Forward platform is all about is the strength of this community being authentic in our pursuit of this life with God. And so the ask is simply this three minute video, three minute audio recording off of your phone, an email that Brian or I can read on this space, letting us know what God is doing in your life as you're taking your faith forward. What it is about this community, about this platform, again, not to give us attaboys or pats on the back, but because something happens when a group of people decide collectively we want to follow God together and benefit from the experiences of each other. So send it to faithforward at cfcwired.org. It'll come to one of us, both of us. And for that hundredth episode, we'll do a compilation of your stories of what God is doing in your life. So again, if it's your video, we'll just add that into the clip. If it's your audio, we put a little graphic up and your voice will run underneath. And if you just don't want to see yourself or hear yourself, but have your story told, send us the email and we'll do a dramatic reading of it. So if you can get those in, again, this episode will be on Sunday, February 11th. So we're going to need at least a few days before that to get that all in. And by we, that's kind of the Royal we, John does all the hard week actually. So by we, I'm probably not going to do anything, but whatever John says. You'll be supportive and encouraging. Oh, thank you. Yeah. You're doing a great job, John. John, did you see this one? Add this one in too. Yeah, exactly. So with all that said, look forward to hearing the stories of what God's doing in your life. In particular with this week's episode, there's a lot of opportunity for us to see God do important and powerful work in us because we are people and that doesn't make this unavoidable that we will all always relapse forever, but there is a way to follow God that results in lasting change. And so Brian, on Sunday, you raised a few issues in this message of the lessons that we can learn from this 13th chapter of Nehemiah. And one of the points you brought out was that our internal commitment must be higher than our external dependence. Yeah. So talk about that. Well, I think it is good to have external things that motivate us. The old statement I use on Sunday, like when the boss is away, somebody say, well, the people or the mice or whatever they would play, right? But when the boss is away and you still work the same way that you work, when you show just as dedicated, it shows that what motivates you is not the fact that there is an external presence holding you accountable. There's something internal inside of you that's moving in that direction. But I will say this, there's nothing wrong with having external things. I mean, we all have moments that we wane and all of that in our spiritual vitality. So having things on the outside, having accountability, that's something external. Having a process and a plan, those are external things. But when it's only the external things that happen, what we're going to see is in many ways what seemed to happen here once Nehemiah left, I mean, once Nehemiah left, over this period of a year to two years, they broke all of them. The one that I spent the most time with is Tobiah, the enemy of the people of God. The one who wanted to see them destroyed, Sanballat's second man in charge, most likely not at all Jewish and certainly not a priest, was given a room in the temple, but not just any room. He was given the room where the tithes were supposed to go and the offerings were supposed to go. And a lot of people say the reason he could have that room was not only because, you know, the high priest at the time put him in there, but because it was empty, because all the things that they promised to give to take care of the temple wasn't happening. There's so many things here and it just showed that when Nehemiah wasn't there, something about their rhythms of life was not sustainable from an internal standpoint, but they needed all the externals. So the one thing I just wanted to be clear on Sunday is it's not that externals aren't helpful, but what happens when they go away? I hope you're watching and listening to this podcast, but if we never did a Faith Forward podcast in the world, you have his Holy Spirit in you. You have his word right here that can help guide and direct you. John and I, I mean, say we get in a car later on, we're heading to Chick-fil-A. Say we were. Say we're not. Who knows? We get in a car accident and we're gone. Hopefully, you know, people would miss us, definitely our wives. So shout out to you again, Brooke, and my wife, Kathy, now in that way since we're giving shout outs week after week. But I hope my wife's spiritual vitality is not dependent upon me. Hopefully I'm a help. I hope that we don't need that pastor. He's helpful. And so I think that is a first thing when we look at principles, that we have to be based first on internal commitment that the externals help, not the externals are what conforms us on the inside. And I think I'd make a great case that at some level, this is what happened. You know, when Nehemiah left, when all these other things happened, they went straight on back for one reason or the other, which is, I think, sometimes interesting when scripture and God through his writers chooses not to give us reasons, just results. And because one of the reasons I speculate about that is, well, maybe it's not important in the story. But the other one is, is I think that sometimes when we see other people's reasons, we can then justify our reasons if it doesn't line up, right? How easy it is when you use the traffic analogy to say, but I'm traffic, you know, forget that I'm part of that in this same way. And so I think our focus is, is that result was there, not what the reasons are. And so I think you asked, well, not I think, I know you did. You asked this question here and I know it's that I thought was super introspective because it brings out the external versus the internal, like, why do you want a life with God? Yeah. Yeah. And that's probably the first place of invitation to just sit with that question and reflect on a little bit. Why do I want a life with God? And there's a few parallels that run through this for me because sometimes examples are an easier way for me to access something deeper and more difficult. But I think back to when I was in middle school choir and I was supposed to be practicing and I had a practice sheet that I and my parents were supposed to sign off on, but I didn't want to practice. I just enjoyed showing up and singing in the choir. I didn't want to have to do that. So I forged my parents' signature and just made it look like I had completed all the practice sessions I was supposed to. And then when I showed up, I wasn't as good as I could have been. So then I start playing sports as an athlete and I have an internal drive to be better, but there's still things like wind sprints that I have a hard time motivating myself to run. Yeah. And I needed my coach to say, Hey, run that faster, run that faster, run that faster, run that faster. Because they were able to push me to a level that I would not have pushed myself, but I was still willing to put up shots on my own. I was still willing to go run on my own. I was still willing to go lift on my own, but they were able to bring out a level of effort, a level of commitment that surpassed what I was able to do on my own. And so as we're looking at this tension of the internal commitment has to be higher than the external dependence, like you were saying, that's not to get rid of the external motivators because we're better together. That's what we've been saying for this whole series is that we're not now flipping the script in the final episode and saying, this is all up to you. Go figure it out. We are better together. And this is part of why is the people around you will push you to levels of connection with God, to realizations about yourself and the kingdom that you wouldn't have had on your own. And God designed it that way. He designed us to be interdependent, but he also designed this to be a very personal and committed relationship. And so if the only reason that I was playing sports was to appease my parents or because my friends were playing at some point, my level of commitment is going to seriously wane. Well, and I think going back and reinforcing this idea that we're not saying we're better together, we're not saying not to be better together. It's just about us where it gets revealed here for them is that their motivation, at least from my perspective, looking at this text at some level had to be, I am now going to be together because this is the best thing for me first, not the best thing for us. And there is some reward punishment idea behind that so that when Nehemiah was not there, they hadn't understood that they are better together period, not whether or not it had some benefit for them. And so it became a point where for some of them, they may just have actually have been because when Nehemiah showed up, you know, he took some receipts, man, on some stuff that was going on and you did have to fall in line, you know, in some very significant ways. We discovered in one of the chapters that actually I don't get into it this week in chapter 13, that when he discovers some things that happens when he comes back, he rips some guys' beards out. There's a lot of cultural understanding behind that that I could go into, but I just did not have the time to get it. But if you read chapter 13 and you want some insight and a holy cow, he's taken some receipts, just email me at faithforward at cfcywire.org, I'm happy to talk about it. But there could have been, I think there was here a lot of people who when the punishment, and I use that term very loosely, doesn't seem able to be meted out anymore, then I'm not internally motivated anymore. You know, when the coach isn't going to bench you for not running your wind sprints anymore, then running the wind sprints isn't there, doesn't mean your shot isn't good, doesn't mean that sort of stuff. And I know exactly what that is. I hated running wind sprints. If you did me the we called it the star drill, the five star shooting drill, I would do that all day long. But if you kept lining me up at the baseline, baseline to foul line foul on the baseline base, I mean, you know, I we used to call them something else. We're not allowed to call them anymore. And what we call them now the technically correct term is to call them but you know, I hated that. But I knew it made me better my shot later on, man, when my coach wasn't looking, I'll say this for me, I'd be like, there's some few times I didn't quite make it all the way to the lines. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And so take stock of that question. And be willing to be honest with yourself. You know, for some of us, why do I want to follow God? Well, there's been family pressure. Or I want to be a good example to my kids. There's nothing wrong with either of those reasons, but that's not a strong enough commitment. That won't get you all the way through to what God's inviting you into. Or like we were talking about just before we hit record, you know, the I don't want to go to hell. That is a great reason. But that just goes right back to the I want to avoid punishment. And avoiding punishment will only take you so far in this life with God. And along the way, it's going to seriously distort how we look at a life with God. Well, if we think of any relationship that we have with people here on this side of eternity, whether it happens to be a family member or a coworker or a neighbor, if our motivation in connecting with them isn't even just to avoid punishment, it's just to not do something wrong. We know that fundamentally that isn't going to be a healthy relationship because the lens for which everything you're acting is is a distorted lens. And as again, we're talking about pre time we got to record too often when we talk about, you know, life and life to the full. It's this here, but it's also for eternity. And we miss what it means life and life to the full here, which is what God is calling the people to hear what we call people to what God calls me to and all of us have relationship with him. But then by accident, we think about eternity. We sell it as fire insurance, like it's a way to avoid hell and hell is real. Scripture makes it very, very clear. But the part I want to be very careful, I say this and hear this that makes hell hell is not the torture is the absence of God's presence. And so that when we think about heaven, it's not that we get to avoid hell. It's that we get God. And so there's a difference. And I think sometimes, John, I don't know about in your life, for me, sometimes parsing that in real time can be challenging because I am a mixed bag of motivations. Many times I can look at many times in retrospect, sort of doing for lack of better terms an autopsy on the last, you know, two days of my life or two hours or two seconds of my life. And looking back, it was very clear this moment where that's where it switched. Like it started because it was a good thing. It started with this. And then it became a lesser thing because on the outside, what's so interesting is, is that for us, if we're in this place in our life, that for a very, very long time, for 12 years, for many of these people in Jerusalem, it was unclear where their motivation came from, whether because from the outside, it all looked the same. Only God and they knew. And in the same way, we can go a long period of time and people on the outside not recognize that and in some ways be self-deceptive. Absolutely. I was just having some moments this week with God about an issue that I struggle with constantly that I go back to and how I want to become fearful, I become a control freak. And again, it's not a control problem, it's a sin problem that shows up in control. All of a sudden, something that I'd never recognized before, I was like, oh, okay, that explains this, that explains this, so that I can start really well. But when that sneaks in, it still looks the same on the outside. But my motivation then becomes, I don't want to lose this relationship instead of I want to follow Jesus. Yeah. So I don't know if that made sense as I said it out loud, if it didn't, again, send me an email, cfcwired.org, faithforward, because it makes sense in my head, but sometimes coming out doesn't make as much sense. So again, sit with that question for a little bit. Why do you want a relationship with God? And just see what surfaces and be willing to be honest with yourself. And like you said, similar to other relationships that we have, do you want to get married because you don't want to be alone? That's a reason, but that's not a sustaining reason. No. Do you want to be married because it'll make life more comfortable to have a second person there or a second income or whatever? Again, that's not a bad reason, but that's not a sustaining reason. So at some point, if the reason isn't, I want to be with this person for the rest of my life and get to know them and all that they are and all that the two of us can become, if that's not, that's the thing that will get you through so many other things. And so at some point in our relationship with God and in our answer to the question, why do I want this life with God, at some point it has to be something other than avoiding something or getting something. It has to be something about getting a connection with someone. That abundant life that we get starting now and into eternity, it's his presence. And so if that's not the orienting principle, if that's not the foundational reason, again, that doesn't mean it invalidates our faith. It doesn't mean we need to give up on our faith. It doesn't mean we don't have a real relationship with God. It doesn't mean we're not saved. It doesn't mean any of that. It just means that there's a whole lot more that God's inviting us into. And that brings us to the second thing that you were talking about on Sunday, which is there is sort of a growth trajectory to this. When I started playing sports, I needed more external support to build more of that internal commitment. But over time, the internal commitment grew and that's the goal. And so it is with this, the internal commitment is designed to grow, but that also means that sustaining doesn't just happen naturally. Yeah. And as I was processing through, you know, what are some, maybe some principles of sustaining? It is just recognizing that it is the nature of our humanity to not sustain something. We have a relationship with Jesus Christ and he has saved us, but we still are a broken people this side of eternity. We are not identity people who are identified by our sin or identified by the righteousness of Jesus Christ. But we still are broken, still have some sin in us. And so that means that entropy is what's going to happen in our life. And so again, we've talked with this, I don't know how many times in this podcast, is it the same guy that ordered the physical world is the one that ordered the spiritual world? And rarely do the rules that apply in the physical world not apply in the spiritual world. Sure. We would not say that, all right, we got in great shape. We did this. We lost 30 pounds, whatever it might be, and then not have a plan to sustain it. I mean, we've maybe done that, but we wouldn't say that out loud. But I think it happens a lot in our spiritual world. We get things lined up with that and that does two things. Number one, it denies the reality of who we are, but also denies the reality of who our enemy is, is that our enemy, who's the one that sneaks around like a roaring lion seeking may devour. He never stops and says to himself, all right, I'm going to say, I mean, this text itself proves it. Tobiah and Sanballat at the end of chapter 12 had lost from an earthly perspective. A year to two years later, they're right back in. They're right back in. Something happened to not sustain that. So there is a mixture both of our brokenness and the enemy's attack that we have to make sure that we remember two things. One, that what got us where we are, didn't happen by accident. And what will keep us where we are and grow up won't also happen by accident. What's your plan in some ways? And to be motivated simply by the results, not the plan. So I just want to say this up front for those of you like me who are planners, for those who like to see this, we are not saying that the plan is the results. What we're saying is the plan can motivate us, it's external, it's helpful, but the results are what matters. I was using this pre-podcast. My wife got me a Fitbit for some health things I've been trying to do a while back. And I was at the gym recently. I've been there about 30 minutes or so. And I looked down on my watch and it said that my heart rate was at 79. Now, at a certain level of my heart rate, it's about 95 to 100, I can't remember which one it is. I start getting credit for activity points on it. Right. And I realized that I was sweating like crazy. I could tell my pulse was at least 110 or higher and it was stuck at 79. Now, the end goal of going to the gym is not to get activity points. It was to get healthier, it is to do all these sort of things. And that occurred whether or not I had activity points. But you know what I realized, John? It felt like in that moment I hadn't done anything because I couldn't see it. I couldn't see my activity points. And that's an example where it all got off kilter for me, where all of a sudden what matter was what my score was, what not the development was. And that is something, as we talk about developing a plan, I really want us to be careful of is that it is not about what your score is, because maybe part of your plan to stay more, you know, sustaining wise is, for example, I am now going to spend an hour a day for three days out of my week reading scripture. And how easy would it become to say I'm more concerned about checking off my hour than I am spending time with God in that hour? And so just as we talk about this plan, I just want to get that out out front. So, yeah, I think it matters. And I think for me, it's an easy one to fall to. Definitely. And I think for me as well, I was realizing that as I was asking this question of what's your plan, that you almost have to first ask yourself, what are my assumptions? And so recognizing that if I assume that inherent in my plan is that if I just keep showing up, I will automatically grow. It's not necessarily true. Right, because you can go to the gym every day and derive minimal benefit depending on how you spend your time at the gym. You can show up to church every Sunday and experience minimal growth. And it's not what you're doing. It's how you're doing it. Lee and I talked about that last week and recognizing that we play a part. We can't do it all on our own. God doesn't ask us to do that, but we play a slightly more active role that also then doesn't put all of the responsibility on us. And to then also recognize that this isn't just about when we talk about our spirituality, learning things, like you said, reading an hour of scripture three times a week is not just about learning information. It's about the information informing the way that we experience our relationship with God and live our life. And so recognizing that your plan needs to incorporate understanding and experience, and that needs to be fairly well balanced. So one of the things that we're going to talk about in just a sec is what's your plan? What are your assumptions about that plan? But then also what's the goal? What, you know, you've talked with physical activity. There's a goal in mind. So what does it look like for not for us to not just have a plan, but to have an understanding of where we're going to have a goal? So I think it's an interesting question. What is the goal? And as I was sort of reflecting on this internally, I recognize that the goal if it's right, will often influence the plan and also allow the plan to be flexible. If it's not correct, the plan is inflexible and the goal becomes submissive to the plan. So let me give you an example. Um, recently, um, I'm in a group with some guys and we had 10 different categories of things that we could sort of choose from. And we all had an overlapping one. And then we had four others. She had five out of 10 and you could set some goals. So one of the things that, for example, that is, is one of my, one of my current goals, and I'm illustrating it this way, the difference between I could set a goal that says I want to lose X amount of weight. That's a very, very, uh, tangible, strict goal that can dictate my behavior about eat, but don't eat healthily. I can, you know, work out in a way that's not healthy because I've learned that once you hit your fifties, rest matters a whole lot more than it used to when you were in your twenties. So, but if I have just a strict number, right, it sort of gets off. Now, bear with me. I think I can make this point without belaboring it too much. Here's my goal. Actually, my goal in getting healthier is so that I have some genetic things in my life that I know that are true. Now God can heal those. God can keep those from happening, but wisdom and history says genetics are genetics. And so John, one of my goals in my life is that if I, if my wife is living longer than me and my genetics kick in like it has for the past two generations of my family, I'm getting healthy so that Kathy has to do less work for me when I'm older. That goal is clear. How that looks is different with the plan because I could be down 30 pounds and not be healthy, not for what that is. And I'm bringing that out specifically because I think, especially when we start making plans, we get really, really tight and say, again, I'm going to read the Bible three hours a day or three, three hours for a week, but the goal is to get closer to God. And it's possible if you approach it wrongly to spend three hours reading the Bible and as the Pharisees did have it memorized and missed the God of the Bible. And I hope that makes sense because I think, again, when we think about this plan, what's my assumption? My assumption is this. My assumption is, is that the goal has to be more principle based and the plan has to move with it. And the goal of my spiritual life is simply this to grow closer to God. That's it. And while that seems very vague, you know, some people are going to go, well, that means you should pray more. Sure. Absolutely. I should. But if I find myself in the moment go, well, I haven't gotten my X amount of time. I don't talk to my wife after 10 o'clock at night. Now I will if she invites me to conversation. So I don't have a lot of quality prayer time with God after 10 o'clock at night. I will if he wants me to do that. But I know I'm in trouble if my plan says I need to spend 30 minutes in time with God and it's 1030 at night and I didn't get it in today. So I'm just going to do it in my marriage. What that I tell you what, if I had that same approach, that is a recipe for arguments, misunderstandings, and unfruitful conversations. And that would be when, okay, I'm just checking a box. I feel like, like a lot of times in this podcast, for any people who've listened, I often go off on tangents and it's John's job to just reel me back in. Um, but that really, that's when we think about plan, that's what just sticks out of me because for so long in my life, I was a box checking person. You know, the fact that, you know, I could rattle off all of these dates in Nehemiah when this was happening, because I'd memorized them at an early age, but I couldn't tell you per se what God was trying to do. Right. That's knowledge without experience and application and information, knowledge without application. And there's actually, um, if you've ever been to our encounter conference at John Leeds, you have a really cool graph that you bring up in there. Yeah. Yeah. And it's, you know, simple X, Y axis. And if we grow on the understanding side, you know, so almost exponential growth, almost shooting straight up, grow on the understanding, but not the experience we're replicating the Pharisees approach to faith that if I just know enough, if I understand enough, then I will have a close relationship with God. And Jesus was pretty direct with them in John five, criticizing them for their emphasis on understanding. He said, you search the scriptures for life and I'm standing in front of you, offering it to you, and you're not accepting it. You have all of this knowledge and your knowledge is supposed to point you to the reality of what I'm offering and you're missing it. You're missing out on the experience. But then if we just only ever chase experiences without growing an understanding, you know, pursue the other axis to the detriment of the first, we remain fundamentally immature. You know, Jesus told us, you know, come like a child, right? To be childlike. And there's a difference between being childlike and childish. You can have, especially at this time of year, Christmas, I mean, come on. The wonder of Christmas in an adult is fantastic. That's being childlike, childish in an adult. It's just a pain and nobody wants that. And so this is the invitation from God that, that when we're talking about the plan, that's, that's probably the more tangible. It's probably the more quantitative. It's more easy to assign numbers to that, but the plan is something that's a little bit more qualitative. It's, it's something that's maybe a little bit harder to put your finger on right now because you haven't gotten there yet. You know, if my, like you were talking about losing weight, if my plan is to lose 10 pounds, great. If my goal is to lose 10 pounds, I can lose 10 pounds and not have experienced a shift in the quality of life that I'm ultimately after because it's not just about the number that the scale says. It's about longevity of life. It's about quality of life. It's about the things that I'll be able to do for longer because I'm taking better care of my body. And that's a, that's harder to put your finger on and say, these are all of the things, but it points us in the direction. As you transition it back to a life with God of the invitation to a life with God is to continue to get closer and closer to God. Are there quantitative steps for that? Yes. Does that involve reading your Bible? Yes. Does that involve praying? Yes. Does that involve sacrificing? Yes. Does that involve serving? Yes. But what's the goal goal is to experience greater closeness with God, to experience more of his presence. And whether we realize it or not, I think we can fall into this trap of shortcutting the process because if it's spiritual health, we're after growing closer to God to keep the analogy moving. That isn't a shortcut process. You know, one of the genetic things for me is blood pressure. So in general, losing some weight helps your blood pressure, but there are also some shortcut ways to lose weight to make your blood pressure worse. Now I could take a whole lot of caffeine and some energy drinks and curb my appetite, which will keep my metabolism up and burning through faster and be great. But at the same time, those things in the way that I'm doing it is blowing my blood pressure like crazy, but it's faster, but it's the wrong thing. And so for some people, I think depending upon how you're wiring, let's, let's go to the, you mentioned falling off earlier on one end or the other spectrum for those people who are super goal oriented, who, who want to have everything written down. And if you didn't accomplish everything on the goal sheet, you feel like you didn't accomplish what it was. This is a helpful paradigm to think through. The question is, did not, did you accomplish everything on here that you wrote down in your plan is, are you closer to God because of this? Now, again, if you're super driven, you may go, yeah, but I could have been closer. Okay. All right. I get that. On the other hand, for the other extreme, like, Oh, well, you know, just my time with Jesus is we kind of figure out as we go. That's true. That can happen, but maybe there's all kinds of other things. You're not allowing freedom in, in those other areas that you would never allow that you don't approach your spiritual life in the same way. We don't approach these other things. I'm not being clear, but you have a plan and there's other things we don't have here, but you never say that about your finances. You would never say it about those other things. So, you know, what is the goal? Um, you know, and, and again, you've been asked another question too. Like, if you're not sure where the goal start thinking about what we asked for versus what Jesus offers. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Getting to a place of need. What's your need. And it's interesting to me that again, the scriptures don't explicitly say this, but it seems like at least part of what was happening in those 12 years with Nehemiah is the people were acutely aware of their need for God. I mean, their city was vulnerable. There were enemies all around. Nehemiah was acutely aware of his need for God. He personally was being targeted. It's easier to focus on our need for closeness with God when we're aware of our need and when things are comfortable, when things are easier, when things get better, you know, when I meet my goal weight, I'm less strict with my diet because I got there, right? The need isn't quite as pressing. And, and so I think if we're often asking God for things that are moving us in the direction of comfort, that are moving us in the direction of easier, God rebuild the walls, metaphorically speaking, whatever's needed in our life. God saved me from my enemies, metaphorically speaking. Again, that's not bad, but what happens when the walls are rebuilt and the enemies are defeated? What's the internal commitment to closeness with God when the external needs seemingly have been met? In other words, are you aware of the internal need? Is there an internal need to be close to God? And I think that's one of the things that Nehemiah was helping people to see during these times of repentance is there's something inside that needs to be addressed, the walls were great. You know, not destroying your own people by, you know, uh, predatory lending practices, good thing, but those are being driven by something inside. And it's just so interesting to me, the way that Jesus constantly shifts our understanding of what he's offering. Um, I hadn't seen this until recently, but Jesus and the woman at the well, he meets this woman at midday and she comes to get water and she sees him sitting there and he asks her for a drink, culturally taboo, weird in all kinds of ways. And she calls him on that. Why are you asking me for a drink? And his response is it's, it's just so disruptive because he immediately flips things. And he says, if you only knew the gift God has for you and who you're speaking to, you would ask me and I would give you living water. Right? What she's asking God for coming to the well at that time of day is water and avoiding ridicule and rejection. And what the God of the universe in human flesh sitting next to that well says there's something you're not asking for something that you don't even know to ask. But if you knew who was sitting here and you knew what he could offer you, you would ask a different question. And they go back and forth in this way over the course of a conversation where she keeps focusing on the tangible, on the material, on the felt need. And that's not wrong. We all do that. And he keeps redirecting her back to a larger reality that there's something that she's not aware of. And there's something that's available that she doesn't know to ask. But if she were to ask for that, it would change everything else so that the felt needs would be different. And so perhaps more importantly than what's your plan and what's your goal is, do you understand what's possible? And the answer for all of us has to be no, we don't. And that's part of our need for closeness with God is to show us this abundant life that he's offering us, that he's inviting us into. There was this book that I read by Thomas Merton called the Wisdom of the Desert Fathers, and it's early century Christians, first, second, third century Christians. And it's people that had already committed to a life with God, often out in the deserts, in the Eastern Mediterranean. And this, this guy who's committed his life to God and has been faithful and reads his Bible and prays and serves and sacrifices and all that, comes to another who seemed like he was a little bit further along. And he says, you seem to have a life with God that's just different than mine. And I read my Bible every day and I pray every day and I care for the poor every day and I sacrifice and I do a little bit of all these things. And his little bit was so ridiculously more than any amount that I do in my life. And he looks at this, this father, this spiritual father, and he says, what more do I do? And do with this what you want. But the way Thomas Merton tells the story is this spiritual father extends his hands and there's flames. And he says, why not become fire? You know, Jesus says, I came to baptize you with fire. And so the spiritual father seems to be pulling at this idea of there's more. And so take the, the literal or the metaphorical of this, however you want, but he was pointing this guy to a higher opportunity, something different than just, well, read your Bible more, pray more, serve more. It was, let's look at this whole thing different. That's what Jesus is doing with the woman at the well. That's what our need for Jesus must ultimately bring us to is this can't just be more quantitative in the life that I'm living. At some point, there is a qualitative shift that I don't fully understand that God's inviting me into. And so it brings us to our favorite part of the show where we say, ask God, that's the invitation is that it doesn't have to be something weird. It doesn't have to be something weird, but there's more. Yeah, there's more as you close most every service with the God who is able to do immeasurably more than we could ask for or imagine. At what point do we start to take that seriously, that that's what a life with God looks like is a life with God is a life with a God who is doing immeasurably more than what we could ask for or even imagine. Well, there's a lot I could say about that, but I think you said it well. There's there's more. And so please don't hear the title of what I said today and on Sunday, rather a sustaining as the same thing as maintaining. It's not complacency. It's sustaining that same fervor and that same fervor and the same desire for God and hope that that they had when they rebuilt the walls would have continued them moving on deeper in a relationship. It's not sustaining the same place. It's sustaining the same heart and attitude, which will constantly move us closer to that. But also, I think that, you know, the last thing at least we're going to cover here today is that. What you can't miss is. Chapter 13 specifically mentions very specific things that Lee talked about last week when he preached a chapter 10. Those are the things that they went back to, and I think there's a principle that we need to be aware of that recognizes our weaknesses often repeat. When I first wrote this line, I said this weakness, our weaknesses will remain our weaknesses. I think a better way to say it will be our weaknesses will remain our vulnerabilities. That's what I meant by our weaknesses. But, you know, he talked about syncretism leaded last Sunday about, you know, if you saw it, you saw the visual of the blender, not very tasty, but he talked about that putting this all together. And it happened because they were marrying people of other religions. They went straight back to that. They went to do all this sort of stuff. There was something about that particular weakness, whether it was the attraction of how someone looked or whatever it might be. And so for some reason, they, as part of their plan, didn't probably have one. But we, as part of our plan, need to recognize that even if we've made progress in every weakness, most likely it's still going to be a vulnerability in, you know, having people around you, having a part of that plan to externally help you. And that is important. Again, we have to make that decision. John can't do for me what the Holy Spirit needs to help me do. But John can say, Hey, Brian, I know that this is one of your vulnerabilities. You've shared this on the podcast or you've shared this in the conversations that we've had. It sure does look like right now that you're living out of that weakness instead of living out of that. And so that's one of the things that I need us to understand. But also that if that is true, that means that we need this rhythm of confession and repentance going back. And here's the good. None of us want to mess up again. I don't think any of us want to mess up again, but we're also naive to think that we won't. And so there are times where clearly we know that we've messed up again. We need to go back again as 1 John 1, verse 9 says, you know, if you confess our sins, it's faithful and just forgive us. And it may feel like this, God, it's me again. Yeah. Yeah. But go back, he's gracious and kind to forgive us our sins again, because he already knows. Right. So it's not new information. But I do think there's an aspect of confession, repentance that sometimes I don't engage in enough is that goes like this, God, I recognize my vulnerabilities and my my weaknesses are always my vulnerabilities. God, so I'm coming to you and I'm asking you to show me where they are. See, the confession aspect is I'm recognizing I'm saying the truth. This is my vulnerability. And then God will speak back and go, Brian, you're being controlling in this area. And then it turns to a second confession and then it turns to repentance in that way. And so for some of us to don't just think of confession, repentance as a lifestyle of reactionary living, but it can also be an aspect of proactive, inviting the Holy Spirit into our life, confessing. We don't know all that we know, but we know this about our nature. It's less than perfect. And, you know, sustaining is difficult. It doesn't happen. We tend to go the opposite direction. So if it's not natural, I'm going to come to you even maybe assuming that some things going on, it matters. It does. It really does. And and again, it's not just a lifestyle of endlessly apologizing for behavior, but it's getting at what's driving those behaviors. It's it's the people that Nehemiah was saying, hey, that that's not a good activity. What's driving that? You know, second Corinthians 10 talks about the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but they're spiritual for tearing down strongholds, every lofty argument and opinion that would raise itself up against the knowledge of God. That that's what a lifestyle of repentance gets at. It's thoughts and beliefs, not just trying to clean up bad behavior. And that's why a lifestyle of repentance is just that a lifestyle. It's a rhythm. It's not a, it's not a, well, I repented for that. I'm done. And one of the things that makes me laugh now is when I find the words coming out of my mouth, oh yeah, well, I, you know, I've, I've dealt with that. It's not that I haven't, it's that there's more, there's more that's still affecting me than I realized that's driving, not only behaviors, but ways of thinking about myself and about God and about the world around me. But if I don't get in the habit of bringing myself to God, not just the things I'm aware of, but the things that I'm not aware of. The things that I'm not aware of and saying, God, help me see. I'm not as close yet as I know I could be. I don't see myself as clearly yet as you see me. Show me more, show me more of what's available. It's just this, it's this chipping away. And God's so kind in this that I love the section in Exodus where he's just brought the people out of the wilderness. Finally, at the end of 40 years of wandering, he's brought them into the promised land and he makes him this incredible promise. I'm going to drive all of your enemies out, right? This land is yours. And you have to imagine like, they're all, they're all excited. The wandering is over. We're home. Those whole thing's going to be ours and make God's making it sound like he's going to do it all at once. So we just get to move in, like move in ready, the furniture conveys and everything. And then God says, but I'm not going to do it all at once. I'm going to do it a year at a time. Because if I, if I removed all of the enemies from the land, you're not actually strong enough and numerous enough to hold it. And so it would become overgrown and the wild animals would come back in. It would be no better off than it was before. And so it is with us, right? We so want, we so often want God to just come in and whoosh it all the way. What are we asking for? We're the woman at the well, just give me water. Oh, there's water that'll never make me thirsty. Okay. I'll take that. Not because of what it offers, but because of what I won't have to do then go to the well every day. I'll just whoosh my problems away. And his invitation is a year by year, stepping into increasing in our strengths and our understanding and our experience of what a life with God, with, of what a life with God looks like, of what a life with him looks like. And so often that's when we want to give up. That's so often when the backsliding happens is I started and it got hard. I started to lose weight and I hit those last five. I quit. I started to pursue sports, music, whatever. And I got to a spot that I couldn't master. And so I gave up and God's invitation is I'm leading you into this a year at a time, bit by bit, I'm preparing your strength. I'm developing your capacity. There's more, don't give up. And that's the invitation on this platform always is taking our faith forward. There's no finish line. No, there's not. But I do think we've come to the finish of our time together. And if you are a faithful listener or viewer of this, just a little heads up. Um, this is coming out on the 17th of December or sometime after that. You're catching this. We are not going to be producing a podcast on the 24th and the 31st on Christmas evenings, but we will be back in the new year, taking a two week sort of Sabbath for John and I and picking up on a whole new subject, but just because we pick up on something new, it doesn't mean we can't revisit something we've already been to because, um, God works that way. And you just said little by little. And so maybe over these next several weeks, something sinks in from this podcast or some early ones we've talked about, look in the book of Nehemiah, or maybe something back from one of the first, you know, a hundred and a hundred good night, 90, some episodes we've done before this one. Uh, we'd love to talk about it. Right. So you can send us an email, faithforward at cfcywire.org. Yep. So until then he's Brian I'm John. Merry Christmas.
