Welcome back to the Faith Forward Podcast, John Ackerman, Brian Bales. We are in week six of this series on the book of Nehemiah, where we're focusing on the reality that there is something greater that God is calling us to, not just in this life with God that we get to have individually, but in this life as the people of God. And so if you've been tracking with us over the previous five weeks of this, honestly, I'm blanking now on the entirety of the narrative arc. So you're going to have to go back to the last episode that Mike and I just did to catch the narrative arc at the beginning. But over the last five weeks, we've been building this, this reality that God places burdens on our heart for things that burden his heart, but are in line with the things that we are passionate about. And that it requires us then to engage in something greater with God as part of engaging in something greater with God out there. So greater prayer life, not just more words, but more connection, more intimacy, in some cases more listening rather than more speaking, as well as a tolerance for greater risk, inviting God to take us into places of discomfort where we're not sure we've got it. We're not sure we know what to do. We're not sure if it's going to work because that's when we get to see God be as big as he is rather than as small as we've often made him. And then the necessity of going slow, right? To not rush out in front of God, the months that Nehemiah spent praying before the, what is it? 52 days? Yeah. Of actual work. Yeah. Next week, yes. And then like Lee talked about that something greater requires something greater than what I have. Both what I'm capable of doing on my own, greater than what I have access to or capability to do. And then that's part of the plan is the invitation for the people, the God to act like the people of God rather than the persons of God. And then like Mike was talking about last week, apparently the narrative came back, that often to experience and participate in something greater outside of us, there has to be something greater that happens inside of us. The work of the heart before the work of the hands in many cases. And so today we're going to talk about sort of a combination of the two, the inner reality that sometimes needs to be addressed in the midst of doing the greater work. But what that looks like in the context of the group, of when the people of God need to have some internal realities addressed. So with that said, Brian, you want to give us a quick summary of where we're going? Yeah. I don't know if I ever do anything quick, but we'll give it a whirl. I didn't mention this on Sunday, but I don't know if like your family had like particular sayings that were very unique to their family. One particular mom, if you're listening to this, please don't be offended. One particular saying that my mom has always had that just was just weird to me. And when I exposed Kathy to it, it was very weird to her. Like if someone starts coughing while they're eating, my mom will ask this question, does it have bones in it? Right. It's, which I think it's her way of saying, did you swallow something? You know, maybe like how concerned do we need to be right now? Yeah, exactly. It's kind of gross just to be honest. But that's such a very like uniquely Baylesian family tradition about that. I suggest you don't pick it up in your own family. But I mentioned at the beginning of Sunday that here's a statement that probably no matter where you come from, you've heard if at first you don't succeed, try, try again. And most of the time we use that statement in a positive way. You've failed. So just keep going. Keep going. When we look at Nehemiah this week, the challenge is, is the context of that is the enemy is using that to get people to fail. If at first I don't succeed in getting to fail, try, try again. And what you discover as we get right before the chapter next week, so next week is when the walls are going to be pretty much completed. The enemies of God, both the adversary and guys like San Violet and Tobiah, they get increasingly desperate as they see is happening in what is unique about this particular section of scripture. So when we stop and we, you know, we pick it up and we look in Nehemiah chapter five or like, okay, what's unique is here is up into this point. All the opposition has been external. This is uniquely an inside job where the enemy is now going to expose some things that have to be dealt with or have to be ignored. If they're not dealt with, they will not be better together for something greater. If they are dealt with, which they are, and they respond, well, God can do something. And I made a point on Sunday that I want to reiterate here. If you're hearing this, I want to be clear that building the walls were difficult. Building the walls were hard and a lot of stuff, but building the walls did not cause the problems we see in Nehemiah chapter five. They only exposed the problems that were already there. To my point, whatever you think about the pandemic, whatever you think about the last three and a half years, I'm not here to make a political statement. I'm not here to make a medical statement. I'm here to make this statement though. It didn't cause anything. It only revealed stuff already in us. It didn't cause anything. And what we've seen over the last three and a half years, four years amongst the church of Jesus Christ, the big C church is the enemy doing an amazingly good inside job. Like I don't have to bring it from the outside to destroy the walls to do something greater for God. I can get the people of God to be against each other and stop the work that way. And so I'm pretty passionate about this chapter more so than any others. Not that the rest of the chapters don't matter, but it just really sort of drove home. And so I just made this point that if we are to be better together, if we're to be something greater, it requires the crucifixion. And I use that word very specifically, very on purpose, the crucifixion of selfishness. Because in my personal opinion, take it from my personal opinion, selfishness is one of the greatest enemies of being better together, of doing something great. When the people of God are supposed to be together and they can't. And so we fleshed this out a little bit, taking a look at what happened specifically that some of the Jewish people had been taking advantage of the other Jewish people after the famine, after the difficulty, after all the taxes, they were charging interest where they shouldn't charge interest on loans. They were taking improper collateral when they shouldn't. And of all kinds of crazy things, they were taking their other brothers and sisters into slavery. Now, we're going to get into this a little bit, but I want to say this upfront. I think we're going to do ourselves an injustice in this text if we immediately start looking at the Jewish people who were hurting the other Jewish people as caricatured and sort of big black hat evil people, because they were also building the wall at the same time. Some of them could have been, don't get me wrong, but they still repent. But I think more likely, as we'll explore in this, that for many of them, somehow along the journey, they lost their way and they began to become blind to some spiritual realities that God used Nehemiah to bring it. And we're going to just give you a heads up because we're going to say again many times, ask God. But one of the practical things we're going to get to later on today and taking our faith forward is who's your Nehemiah? Who do you have in your life? Who is in your life that when you have spiritual blindness, because we all do, or spiritual deafness, that they may have the vision of God that's come to them. They may have the heart of God and the voice of God that they can speak into your life. We all need it. So with that being said, that was my somewhat long-winded and going back, even though John did actually give a good review, even though he said he wouldn't, that doesn't mean don't go back. So with that said, Brian, on Sunday, on Sunday, you, you gave us a few topics to consider when it comes to this idea of the crucifixion of our selfishness. And one of the first takeaways that I had looking over that was it's not just the crucifixion of your selfishness for you so you can be less selfish. It's the crucifixion of your selfishness because your selfishness is affecting others and you don't realize it. I mean, it's hard to figure out which one's worse, right? Your selfishness is affecting others and you do realize it, or your selfishness is affecting others and you don't. But in either case, it's having an effect. And so you sort of fleshed out three different areas where our selfishness has an effect that we often need to have our eyes open to. And so the first one was just in the area of self-protection. In other words, this is mine, I want it, or this belongs to me, and so I have the right to hold onto it. And you said this, or some version of this, because again, we record in advance. There's still people that stop me on Sundays and they're like, don't you have to get upstairs to record the podcast? And I really appreciate the fact that they're giving me the out, but no, so we're in advance. We're pretty sure you're saying this, but selfishness misunderstands the origin of things. That essentially what I have was given to me and the giver has the right to tell me what to do with his things. And so one of the areas where our selfishness needs to be addressed is in how we view the things we have and how we view the origin of the things we have. And if we stop there, one of the things that we can think about God is that really what God wants to do is just pry our fingers off our stuff, sort of that forced sharing that maybe you had to endure when you were a kid. I know I had to do with my younger brother of, no, let him play with your toy. And in some cases they had to pry my fingers off of my toy and give it to him and say, good job sharing, to which I was just secretly plotting in my head the amount of time I needed to allow to elapse before I could quietly yank it back. And then if he complained, you know, push him. God's not just after the forced relinquishing of our stuff because it's his and we recognize his legal authority. But more importantly, what he's after is the cultivation of our heart to go back to Mike's point last week about something greater happening inside of us. So that it's no longer about him telling us what to do with his stuff, but that we have become so like him, that we think like him, we feel like him, we live like him and we give like him. And that seemed to be one of the things that was fundamentally at odds with the situation Nehemiah found himself in. Yeah, a lot of the tension culturally was there around land, right? And so I don't, in case you didn't listen to Sunday, right, or didn't pick it up because I may not have made a great point on it, was around people, land being taken from them and that was used as collateral and that sort of thing. And a lot of the people who are getting rich off the other Jewish people, land was at the basis of it. Well, there's this verse in Leviticus that says this, this very land that they're in, God said this, I'm the Lord, your God, who brought you out of Egypt and gave you this land. I bring that into this point that somewhere in the midst of our selfishness sometimes, we forget who gave us what we have in the first place. And instead we develop, this is a mine attitude instead of more, this is a steward attitude. If someone's ever been around a young kid, you know, at some point, you know, they have something, they say, it's mine. All right, let's flesh that out a little bit. Did they buy it? Who gave it to them, right? The answer is no, and probably someone who cared about them, maybe a friend, maybe a family member, maybe a parent, whatever it might be. Yes, they have ownership of it, but you see something kind of at odds when they're not unwilling to open their hand to someone else because someone opened their hand to them to give it. And when I think, you know, about what it looks like to take my faith forward in this sort of crucifixion of my selfishness, one of the diagnostic questions that I sort of ask myself is, where is this sort of like mine showing up? Like where like, oh, this feels like mine, this feels like mine. And because I believe, at least looking at the text, when you start with a premise that it is mine, which is a wrong premise, it's something we're stewards of and given, it can allow us to then begin to make other little small errors. It's much like if you're just one degree off true north and you go a hundred miles, you're going to be a long way off where you need to go. So I think for many of us, it starts with these small imperceptible problems that then leads to another, it leads to another, it leads to another. And if we start by looking and say, Jesus, all right, show me in my life where I have this self-interest that I'm saying mine. And for me, I think it goes depending upon my season of life in different areas. My current mind, just to be honest, is more my time. This is not meant as a confession for anyone to feel bad for me or any of that. I have a phenomenal gift of God in my life known as my family. Great job. But I'm tired. I'm tired. And so there are times where I feel like God's asking me to do something with my time. And I'm like, that's mine. Like I need, I need a nap. And listen, you need to understand napping is one of my spiritual gifts. I can do myself a nap. But then I realized, okay, it's not the question of whether this is mine. The question really is, did the Holy Spirit ask me to do it? Even if he did, I know that anything I do is for my good and his glory. And we have to start though, by recognizing the time that I have, here's what the time that I have, I have, because he gave it to me. Every breath that I take, every movement, every, that is a gift of God, right? I was going to sing the song, but I didn't do it. Thanks for the smile on that one. Now I just got it in my head the whole time. It's from God, right? And so the point is, is that I've been given a gift of this time. How do I make sure I not hold it this way? How do I make sure I hold it this way and say, Holy Spirit, what is it you want me to do with this? Do you want me to do this extra thing or do you not want me to do this extra thing? And that can show off on both sides because we've talked about on this podcast before, at least for me and for you as well, not being good at resting when God says no time. So we can go off both ends. But I think that's a good question. When we're self-protecting, when we're being selfish, are we forgetting the actual where we got something from? We got our breath. We got our time. We got the land in this case that they were taking from people from God. And so as the giver of something, he has the inherent rather right to actually put some conditions on it. And that's not trying to be like, I'm pulling strings. But as the donor, it's okay to say that, right? Because he said, I'm going to let you steward it, but you need to try to do it this way. And when we get that out of line, then we begin to see some of the things that are happening. And it's so kind of God to recognize sort of our fundamental condition that we need constraints put on things because we're not yet at the point of seeing it naturally. So I think back to when I was a kid and I was going to Sunday school and my Sunday school had the little envelopes for the kids to put their offering in. And so like, you know, my couple of quarters or whatever I was doing, and either nobody taught me, which is probably not fair because they probably did, or I just wasn't at a place yet where I could understand why other than because I had to, I had to. All I knew was somebody was taking my hard-earned allowance, which is a joke as a seven-year-old to say my hard-earned allowance. But something that was mine was being taken from me under protest because there was a rule that said I had to. I know what you're saying, but I want to pause just for a moment. And I'm not trying to poke anyone in the chest when I say that. It's a joke as a seven-year-old, it's a joke as a 57-year-old as well, right? It never stops being a joke. Because what's hard work for a seven-year-old? Like, oh, that's not hard work, but they're seven, right? And that same lie, that same, I've got to deal with mine, I've got to deal with, and I think that was most likely very real because again, if we think about the context I talked about on Sunday, they had just spent a lot of famine, right? Some people got crushed by that famine. The people who didn't get crushed, it would have been easy to say, well, another famine could come and I have to make sure I don't get crushed next. And so the way that I make sure that I don't get crushed next is I'm taking advantage of this business opportunity that's shown up in this moment. And you see how it moves a little bit? In that point, it's like, I'm not trying to take advantage of you, but I'm trying to take care of me and not trust God, which is mine. And ultimately going back to the selfishness that you said it before, it winds up hurting everyone because at least as I understand the text, I can be wrong, the greatest crisis and the greatest chance that the walls were not going to be rebuilt was right here in Nehemiah 5. Not from Tobiah, not from Sanballat, not even from the obvious attack of the enemy, but from the internal strife that happened. It all stopped for a moment. I mean, they were looking around and going, we're building these walls with you and you're taking our kids in slavery. We're building these walls with you and by the way, you took wrong collateral. By the way, you're charging me exorbitant interest, which they weren't even supposed to charge any interest, which is a conversation that we can have another time. But yeah, I mean, look, it's one thing to say you and me, John, against the outside in me of the world. It's another thing if I feel like you're the one that's clipping me. And I think a lot of people who listen to this, a lot of people who've stopped coming into a church gathering, who may just watch online, it's like, Jesus, they're still good with, but the church they're not, they've experienced from their perspective and in some cases very much a reality, a version of that. Other believers who have clipped them, whether they've done it by accident or done on purpose, it doesn't change the fact they've been clipped. And so what happens when that occurs? We want to quit the team. We want to quit the better together. We want to quit the something greater. And that's what was happening here. Yeah. And, and again, in God's kindness, he's set up these guidelines because he knows that this is an internal gravitational pull for our flesh that needs to be crucified. And so whether it's me as a seven-year-old or me as a 37-year-old, right, and this was my journey with recognizing where my stuff came from, right? As soon as I stopped going to church as a kid, it was like, well, good. I am back to where things are supposed to be, where my money's mine and nobody's taking it from except for, you know, taxes once I start working. But then as I came back to faith and came closer and closer to God, and I allowed him to start talking to me about some of these internal realities, we got to the point where he started talking to me about my money and about this word tithing that I had fiercely avoided for so long. And I had been playing the game of self-protection of, no, God, you don't understand. I don't have enough yet. I can't afford to give my stuff to you the way that you're asking. So I'll dole out a little bit here and there just to, you know, sort of artificially check a box so that I don't have as much guilt. But the more that I started to understand God saying, no, the way that I've designed this is, this is mine. And because this is mine, I'm telling you that you need to give up part of what I'm giving to you so that you have to confront the reality that you're not providing for yourself, that I'm providing for you. It changed my life. It was incredibly disruptive and wildly painful for long stretches, but it forced me to begin to live differently, see differently, hear differently, understand differently, and to live out of the reality, no, this is his. This isn't mine that I am choosing to be generous and give to him. This is his, and I'm being obedient, and I've had to do the same thing with my time. I mean, just in the last year between work and work on this house that if you've been a long time listener, I'm still working on my house. And I was sort of complaining to God over the last year, God, I don't have enough time and I need you to do something miraculous because I need more time. And God's invitation was, I want you to start regularly practicing Sabbath. Yeah. And I was like, you know, is this thing on? Did you, did you hear me? I need more time. And he says, yeah, I want you to start practicing Sabbath. I want you to come to a place of surrender where you recognize you've already begun to recognize so differently than you used to that the resources you have are mine and I've given them to you. I need you to start to recognize the time you have is mine and I've given it to you. And so I need you to start living in the way that I have asked people to live since the beginning where you take a portion of your time and recognize I gave it to you. And so you spend that time in the way that I've asked you to spend it, which is not trying to get ahead, which is not trying to knock off the to-do list, which is resting and delighting and connecting and trusting that in six days I can do the work of seven because you can't do the work of seven days in seven days. You have enough life experience that's proven that to you. And so I need you now to live differently and you're not seeing it clearly yet, right? You're blind in this area. You are fairly convinced that if I just did something miraculous for you, John, you could make it all work. If I just gave you more than you would have enough and I'm inviting you to live differently so you can see differently. You know, connecting back to one of the main points that Mike made last week is I think we can make this observation and I believe it's absolutely true. There is a correlation between my level of selfishness and my understanding of my identity in Christ. The deeper I live and understand that I'm the son of the almighty God, he perfectly loves me, unconditionally accepts me and always protects me so I don't have to fear or perform. The more I live and understand that, the less selfish I naturally am. But when I'm not, I see that come up. And again, I want to go back to these people who were doing the wrong thing. I'm sure that there were some absolute positive evildoers in there. I really am. But experience tells me there's also a whole lot of people that wind up doing some things like in retrospect like, how did we get there? Little by little and missing the mark and starting this idea of this is mine and I've got to protect myself and I've got to do that, not trusting God. I think that that opens a doorway, not only for the lack of growth in our own personal life, but again, how it affects others. And, you know, when we look back to the ultimate, you know, statement of Jesus, when he was asked, what are the greater commandments? He said, love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul and your mind and love your neighbor as yourself. Selfishness is by nature the archenemy of loving your neighbor. And so we've got to sort of just grapple with that, um, in how it shows up in very obvious ways or maybe in less obvious ways it's snaking into our life. Yeah. And so this may be a good time to hit pause and just invite God to help you begin to see differently, think differently, hear differently about what's yours and what he might have to say about that. And not only how it's affecting you personally, but how it's affecting the people around you. My view of what was mine when it came to resources was having an effect on not just me and my heart, but on the people around me, people I knew and people I didn't know. I mean, there was a long stretch where I was attending CFC before I was on staff where I felt like that's a big church. They don't need my money. That had an effect on my heart because it shaped my view of resources, but it also meant that I wasn't providing resources where they could have been utilized in ways that would have helped others. Perhaps people I knew, but people I didn't. You know, with time and money, and this isn't, you know, a podcast about time and money, but they are probably, in my opinion, two of the greatest doorways into how our selfishness works. I also want to say this, and I know exactly what you were saying, John. I just want to flesh it out just in case someone hasn't listened to us talk for a while. Yeah. I want to be clear. CFC doesn't need your money. Yeah. God has CFC under his control. Yeah. However, the reason that God uses people who call this church their home church through their time and their resources is not so that all of a sudden the corporate entity of CFC won't go under, but rather we see this miraculous interplay, how God shows up as father in our individual lives, and then how God brings us together in our corporate lives to do something better together that when it's done, we go, wow, look at what God did. Look at where I stepped out in faith and he answered and he was true. Look at where we stepped out in faith and he answered and he was true. And I only bring that up, John, not because you were unclear, but because there was a whole lot of time in my life where it turned to a different part of selfishness. So hear me this, it can be selfish if you say this way, well, this is mine. I don't need to do this. Or you can say, well, the church isn't going to get by if I don't do this. Both of them are very isentric statements. And in that point, any isentric statements by nature is rooted in some level of selfishness. Yeah. So again, maybe hit pause there for a little bit, see what God has to say. But Brian, you'd also talked about the, the second area of selfishness was selfish when we misunderstand who we represent, that in some cases, this isn't just about self-protection. This isn't just about, you know, this is mine and I don't want to let it go, but rather, and you didn't use this word, but it was the word that came to mind for me. This is about self-glorification. This is about the building up of what I think is important. Or it's about the glorification of God on my terms. I'm going to do this the way that I think it should be done for God's glory. And we had talked about that going back to God placing a burden on Nehemiah's heart. It wasn't Nehemiah feeling burdened for something objectively related to God and saying, you know what? I think I'm going to go do this for God. And I hope God likes it and appreciates it and recognizes how much I've done for But it was the recognition of this is what God is burdened by and what I am burdened by. And sometimes when we misunderstand who we represent, we decide I'm going to do this my way on my terms with my things. So anything you want to flesh out about that? Cause I had some thoughts from Romans that just felt like they really tied in here. So, yeah, I do have a couple of thoughts on it. Um, first one is, is the irony of what's happening here. So you fast forward to the sermon on the mount, favorite section of scripture, knowledge, scripture, five, six, seven, just side note. If you have to pick, in my opinion, three chapters to read every day for the rest of your life and had nothing else, that would be pretty good. Um, Jesus said, Matthew chapter six, verse 33, seek first his kingdom and all these things will be added unto you. What are all those things? Well, you back up and it's probably all the things that the people in Jerusalem were trying to find after themselves. The irony of it is to gain. We have to give away to get what we're concerned about. These things we're holding here. We've got to let go of them. It is the very invert inverted life, so to speak, compared to what culture in the world is. And that's where God shows up. That's where he shows his God. And that's where you're looking at some of these things you have here in Romans. That's really a lot of what also Romans talks about when it says, if you want to gain, you got to give a, there's a section in Matthew chapter 16, verse 24. Anyone who wants to find life must follow me and deny myself. There's a lot of opposites in this, but that is where God shows up and that's what he's calling us to. And so for us, I think a lot of times the tension is, you know, okay. I understand it, but do I really believe it? So what were we going to say about Romans? Yeah. So I was, I was teaching a class a couple of weeks ago on a Wednesday night and the class was about renewing the mind. So Romans 12 too. And for whatever reason, I just, I had this thought. Um, my wife Brooke was opening up the class cause we've been team teaching it. And yeah, Brooke, hi. Um, last week I made a obnoxious grammar joke for her that I knew because I knew she, because she watches that she would appreciate and she appreciated in the way that I knew she would, which was not at all. There you go. Um, when she was opening up the class and I just had this thought, I don't remember the context of 12 too. I don't remember what comes just before and just after, right. And so I sit down and I flip over to Romans 12 and for whatever reason, I had a couple of highlights in my Bible from different times that I've read through Romans and I was just drawn to the space that I had highlighted right before Romans 12, it's the end of Romans 11 where it says, oh, how great are God's riches in wisdom and knowledge, how impossible it is for us to understand his decisions and his ways for who can know the Lord's thoughts, who knows enough to give him advice and who has given him so much that he needs to pay it back for everything comes from him and exists by his power and is intended for his glory. And so all glory to him forever. Amen. And then Romans 12 starts. And so again, we go back to the whole biblical idea that chapter divisions are something that happened well after. Yes. But it can, so it rather than it being a fresh start, it's the continuation of that thought and it begins with an and so meaning take into consideration everything that just came before. And so I plead with you to give your bodies to God because of all he has done for you, let them be a living and holy sacrifice. Yeah. And so you've probably heard the, let your bodies be a living sacrifice and you've probably heard, you know, let your minds be transformed or renewed, but I had never seen all of these put together in one thought in my head of everything comes from God exists by his power and is intended for his glory. And so give your bodies as a holy sacrifice. And as a result of that, let God transform you by changing the way you think. And then Romans 12, three was, I give each of you this warning. Don't think you're better than you really are. And it was just one of those times where suddenly the, the reality of scripture and what Paul is saying across what has previously to me been separate verses that I've looked at separately is this much larger idea of this is exactly what Nehemiah is wrestling with in this section. And this is exactly what these people have been wrestling with. This stuff is mine. I'm doing the logical thing that you would do if this stuff is mine, right? I'm, I'm charging interest because I have to get through and everybody else charges interest. It's just what we do. And I understand we're not supposed to, but you know, it's the way of the world. And if people don't pay what they owe, well then, you know, there's consequences and you shouldn't have, right. And you know, what could you have possibly expected us to do? No one forced you to do this. Yeah. Right. But everything came from him and it came from him because it's intended for his glory. And we're not just talking about resources because you came from him and you are intended for his glory. That's why he gave you to you and to this world is so that he would be glorified. And so the way that we respond to that gift of us and what he's given to us is we give it right back as a living sacrifice. And this isn't just about your body. This isn't just about physical health and nutrition and diet, because immediately after that, he says, part of being a living sacrifice is you sacrifice the way that you think and you allow your mind to be renewed, to be transformed, right? It's a, it's a change. It's not a marginal improvement. It's, it's different. Yeah. And I'm giving you this warning. Don't think that you are better. And this isn't a, let me smack everybody down a little bit. This is, you don't see yourself clearly, right? There is the flesh that needs to be crucified. And so it was just, it was one of those times where this was just front of mind because I hadn't seen it. And then I see your message and it's like these two things just slam right into each other. And it finished with this thought that as I've been reading books a few years ago, I came across this quote from one of the early Christian fathers in the church, St. Irenaeus, you know, second century AD. And he said this, the glory of God is man fully alive. And it was just so disruptive when I heard it because it ran so counter to what I felt like I had pieced together from everything else, right? That, that can't be it, right? The glory of God is obedience. The glory of God is God has all the resources that he wants. The glory of God is more people coming into the kingdom. The glory of God is serving the glory, right? The glory of God is you fully alive because he gave you to you for his glory. And his invitation was give it right back to him and be transformed because a transformed you is the most glorious representation of God on this earth. There's a lot that I love about that Romans chapter 12 section. And thank you for bringing the, the, the part before it, because that is, that's the, you know, therefore in light, you know, a lot of our versions say therefore, which is just, I don't know, friend said this cheesy joke, but it's true. Whenever you see, therefore you look what is therefore like in light of what I just said, but there's this, this thing about sacrifice that in almost every occasion that we think about sacrifice is dead. This is different. This is living. And so maybe a practical question to take your faith forward is, is that, you know, when we think about living sacrifice, we understand number one, it's voluntary. So we are voluntarily laying ourselves down for God to be God in our lives. He's not forcing it upon us, but if we voluntarily lay it down, that also means that we can voluntarily hop off. And I know for a fact, there's been times in my life where I feel like I am literally like the person who's up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down on that. Um, and especially when he begins to work at my selfishness, work at some things to conform in the image of God, to renew my mind, as it says later on, if it gets uncomfortable. And sometimes I thought it's something I wanted. And then when it starts happening, I'm like, I'm not so sure. There's a whole section of, uh, I guess we can go in chronicles of Narnia and the dragon and the scales that I want to talk about, but we'll get to a different point where it's painful and it's hard for that to be removed. And so what I like to suggest, if you're thinking about, well, how's this practical to me? I said before, you know, where are you tempted to say mine in my life? Maybe another way to approach that question is where in your life, if you hopped on the altar and it got uncomfortable, you'd be tempted to hop off or where do you already know you've hopped off? Maybe you stepped into something that you felt like God wanted to help you learn not to be so self-focused, but to be focused on him and to be better together for something greater. Maybe. And we've stepped off because lots of things happen and going back to maybe the thing that happened was, is it another person in your community hurt you? And so for you, when God asks you, it's not about give more time or give more money. It's, it's be with them, you know, allow these other broken people to be around me. And we're not saying there shouldn't be good boundaries. I'm not saying that that's probably a conversation that could go farther than what we have time for in this particular podcast, but it is a sort of reminder. That's where we become fully alive when we're fully living and fully trusting from God, um, that, um, we are most fully alive when our self is most fully crucified in that way, which goes back to this idea again of self-deception. Um, uh, again, I mentioned Matthew six, seek first the wrong. I don't think we seek first God's kingdom. I don't know that I wake up in the morning going, I'm seeking my kingdom. Like first off, if I did it that cheesily, you should make fun of me, but you know, it's reflection of what am I building that day? Maybe not physically building, like you would physically build with a hammer, the stuff at your house, but where is like, is this about this or this one of the temptations that I am currently working through as I, as I age is I'm a lot closer to retirement than I am to when I started, you know, working and, you know, you, you look at the money that you've put back and you look at these sort of things and you think to yourself, God, if you want me to work till I'm 90, I will. You know, if you say that, but I don't want to put myself in a situation where I have to work till I'm 90 saying, welcome to Walmart. Here's your cart. Better probably do that with dentures at the time. Um, and so I can become unbelievably focused on, well, what is my retirement say? I got two kids that are entering college area. What does that say? And that's not wrong to look at those things where it gets off kilter is when we begin to say, well, then now it's fully my responsibility to do it. Or God, if you ask me to give up what's in my kid's college fund, what I do it, you know, and trust that you have another way for me to help my kid through college. You know, somebody like, well, I wish I had a college fund. I don't want you to get distracted on that. It didn't say mine was very big. I'm just saying the point is in that moment, what am I doing? What am I trying to build? Am I trying to build God's name or my trying to build something for me in a godly way, but I'm first. And so if I'm building something for me in a godly way, you know, it's not really godly in that way. I don't know if I'm fully making sense, but I'm just trying to highlight how easy in my life it is to be self-deceived without even knowing it. Yeah. Yeah. And I think as we look at the folks that Nehemiah was addressing, none of them would have said they were actively building something against God. I totally agree. They, they were, they were taking advantage of opportunities that had presented that may have been in a questionable gray area, but were not considered, you know, deeply, wildly, objectively immoral that made them, you know, black hat villains. Sure. Yeah. But they were seeing an opportunity to expand what they had to create greater comfort, to create greater possibility. And what Nia points out, what Nehemiah points out to them is you're not seeing clearly and it's having an effect. And that is the case for all of us is that there are parts of our life that just seem logical, that just seem like, why wouldn't I do this? This, this is a no brainer and they're not even necessarily wrong. They're not even necessarily evil, but we're blind to the reality of what they represent and we're blind to the reality of the kingdom that we're focusing on developing. And the promise of God is if you seek first the kingdom, I promise you everything else will be taken care of. And yet there's something in us that goes, I don't know if I trust that. And so it comes back to this selfishness of, all right, well, I'll hop on the altar for a little bit, but then I'm going to hop off and go squirrel away something, a little nest egg, just in case you don't come through and I'll seek your kingdom for a little bit, but I'm going to continue to back build somewhat as a fail safe, as a plan B, because I'm not entirely sure that I trust that if I seek the kingdom first, everything else will be added. Well, and that goes back to what we said at the top, that that's why we need other people like Nehemiah in our life to show us in those areas where we're self deceived at. You said something that just popped in my head, didn't say it in my notes, probably won't say it coming up on Sunday, but when I think you mentioned it, the words are really close to each other and made that connection. One of the greatest self deceptions I think that Western Christians have is that God is concerned about our comfort. It's super interesting where we design a whole thought process around that God's goal is to make us comfortable. God's goal is not to make us miserable. God's goal is to make us more like Jesus. What sometimes comes with a lack of comfort. That's a very Western thought process. By the way, in the Eastern world, Russian orthodoxy, for example, has a really good example of this. They actually believe God is blessing you by how much pain you're going through because they come up in a, you know, you think communism, a lot of that sort of stuff. There's a lot of persecution. So they look at it and say, Oh, God must really love me. Here's all these bad things that are happening. Both of them are off kilter. Right. If we find ourself, if I find myself seeking comfort, seeking my way first out of the challenge, out of the moment on the altar without first saying, God, what are you doing? And I can't leave until you accomplish what you want to accomplish in me. We're accidentally self-deceived and that's free. That wasn't in the notes. I just think comfort is a really easy one for me in my life to get deceived by. And I know it is for others because lots of times the problem of pain, the problem of evil, the problem of difficulty is one of the greatest things that people say. I'm not gonna be better together. It could certainly happen here in Nehemiah. Here are other people causing me pain. Here are other people causing me difficulty. Now, the end of the story of Nehemiah, right, is again in here is like it all got given back to them. It all came back right, but it didn't mean that it wasn't hard until then. And so the question there again is it's not so much where are you blind because blindness is really hard to self-diagnose, right? If you're not sure if your vision is working correctly, you go to a specialist and they check your vision because they have an objective standard of what clear sight looks like. And so it is with us. If you sit around trying to figure out where you're blind, you will probably just become more blind as a result. Yeah. I mean, mutual friend of ours uses this example. You use it. I use it in the encounter conference or in, you know, other classes that we do is that it's spiritual blindness is the only thing that we know that we have blindness that we're not aware of. You know, it's like we lost our glasses, our way of seeing the analogy. The problem is we got two problems. We can't see and we can't see to see the thing we need to see. And so God uses his spirit directly in our lives. And we never, ever want to, to underestimate that. If you aren't sure where you might be spiritual blind, ask God, he will tell you. But I will say that often the ways that he tells us is through the other Nehemiah's he puts in our life, you know, ask them. So, and you know, it's a hard question. I'm like sometimes like, oh, I'm going to ask this question. Do I really want to hear the answer? And the truth is sometimes, no, I don't. But I know that I probably need it. Uh, and so then I asked God's help in that way, but this isn't necessarily about me. I just think for all of us, that blindness is a big deal. It is. And the invitation here is not to go out and help other people solve their blindness. That takes us right back to the log and the spec that Jesus teaches on, but it's, it is an invitation for people, for you to invite people to speak into your areas of blindness in both the field of communications and psychology, there's something called Jahari's window and it's a four quadrant thing that is, I see clearly and other people do too. And then there's, I see clearly, but other people don't. And then there's, I don't see clearly, but other people do. And that's a really helpful space is to invite people that see us more clearly than we see ourselves, which is not an all the time thing, but it's a some of the time thing. It's what Nehemiah is doing in this instance. He sees the situation more clearly than those people at that moment. That doesn't mean Nehemiah has a monopoly on truth and clear sight for the rest of his life, but it means in that moment, he saw them more clearly than they saw themselves. And most importantly, they were willing to listen. And so that's the invitation is who do you have that you're allowing to play the role of Nehemiah in your life that not only has permission to speak, but that you're willing to listen. And so ask God and ask others. Yeah. Which brings us, you know, kind of right back to where we started that in order to do something great, to be better together, we have to crucify our flesh. Now, I didn't even say that well, because we actually can't do it, but we have to submit to that crucifixion. You know, Galatians chapter five is where I ended. Those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with the passion and crucified with its passions and desires. If you understand the context, they're not saying they've done it themselves. Hop on the altar. But then it goes to say, if we live by the spirit, let us also keep in step with the spirit. So here's what I want us to understand. This is not a call to get rid of desires. No. This is a call to examine the source of those desires. We do not have time to go in this. I mentioned encounter now twice, but one of the most profound things I think that we teach in Encounter is helping people that many times when we think about the tree of the knowledge and good and evil, both are rooted in ourselves, that we sometimes recognize some very evil things that we could do that are selfish. And then what we try to do is we just try to do good things, but it's just the other side of the same tree. It's in ourselves. We're self-oriented. And so I think that's where a lot of the deception could have happened here. Good things and some bad things for the tree of knowledge of good and evil. And by the way, if you did not follow that analogy, just, I encourage you just email John or I at faithforward at cfcy.org. We'd love to just flesh that out. We don't have time to that today, but I will say this. This is not about not having desires. It's just not about that, but rather it's putting ourselves on the altar, let him crucify us and then delighting ourselves. It says also in the Lord, and they will give us the desires of the heart. That's what it means to be fully alive. Not living without desire, but living with all the desires and living from the desires that God has placed in our heart. Because I think, you know, we can be people of extremes. We can go, Oh, I've got all selfish desires. Now I'm not going to have any desires. God did not make us to be desire lists or did not have desires. He made us to live from his. So again, as we reach the end, the invitation is not just to go on to the next podcast, but to pause and to not just pause and reflect, but to pause and listen, to pause and invite God into that space and ask what he has for you in this moment. And to recognize that the crucifixion of our flesh is not just something that happens in a moment, that it's an ongoing process, it's remaining on the altar. And so in the days to come, in the weeks to come, in the months to come, allowing this to be a category that informs your time with the Lord, that is something that you not only allow him to speak to when he chooses to bring it up, but it's something you ask about. It's something you become curious about, not fearful of, not ashamed of, not guilty of, but curious about, curious about these areas where you don't yet see clearly, curious about these areas where he may yet want to give you more than you had previously expected or asked for or imagined. So pause and listen, and then continue to ask, knowing that if we ask, the promise is that he will answer. Anything else? No, just know that if the enemy first doesn't succeed, he will try again, but greater is he, God is in us and he's in the world, and he provides the power that we need for the circumstances in that the enemy is trying to just truthfully create an inside job here at Christian Fellowship Church, here at the church at large, for us to do the work of the enemy on his behalf. And listen, we're broken people. We will make mistakes. We will fall. This is not a judgmental statement. It's a truthful statement. But the difference is whether or not when the Nehemiahs come in our life, when God uses others, we do what they did in verse 12 and verse 13, and that is repent. Think differently, walk differently, change our behavior, crucify the flesh with the help of Jesus, and then we'll be better together for something greater. At least that's what scripture says. So that's what I believe. Again, if you want to talk to us, you can send us an email, faithforward at cfcwired.org. We'd love to talk to you. Yeah. Until then, we'll see you next time.
