Welcome back to the Faith Forward Podcast, John Ackerman, Brian Bales. Actually Barry White, Brian Bales. You're going to hear the deep soulful voice of the man with a cold today. So thank you for gutting it out in advance. We've been doing this too long because I was, I was cracking myself up this morning as I was getting ready. I was doing some like, you know, outro takes in my head of like, this is the Faith Forward Podcast, God's love all the time, morning, noon, and night. Can't get enough of your love, baby. I don't need that. All right. So sing and done, sing and done. Now that we're back, um, before we dive into today, uh, which is the second to last message in this six week, two part series of better together and give away people, give away people came first, better together is where we are now. Um, it's episode 99, episode 100 is next Sunday. Again, there's no rules. Got to come on fives and tens, but we wanted to take this opportunity to commemorate you as people that have chosen to walk with God and take your faith forward. And so one last request, send us a video, send us audio, send us an email that we can read on the podcast of what God is doing in your life as you take your faith forward, it's not about the podcast. It's not about what the podcast has done in your life. It's, it's not pats on the back for us. It's an opportunity to share the stories of what God is doing in your life, because as revelation tells us, and you mentioned it last time, that's how we overcome. It's the blood of the lamb and the word of our testimony. And there's never a bad time to share those stories. So if we get enough to run a hundredth episode, that's partially full of stories. Great. If it's totally full of stories, great. If we open up with a couple of stories that we've already gotten, thank you, Jenny and Elam. Um, we'll run those and, and then we'll just talk about the next message. You know, God is good at providing what we need when we need. And one of the things when we do ask for feedback and isn't necessarily for John and I to feel good, even though we don't mind feeling good, it is in some ways understanding a little bit of what we're going to talk about today, that when we show our story with a community that we're called to, and if you're listening to this podcast, you are part of a community in some ways that it can often be encouraging to other people. So part of this, you know, obviously is to help us, you know, celebrate what God's done, but as we think about today, um, maybe we should think about if you have a chance to send it in, encouraging other people and showing your story. Now, this has nothing to do with a podcast, but this is just getting the squirrels out of my mind. So if I was super, super creative, I thought about putting 99 red balloons right here behind us for our 99th episode in my low key eighties reference at the same time, but I'm both cheap and not creative. So I just got the thought out and be it done. So this is the Naina episode of Faith Forward. We're very glad that you've joined us, uh, as we pick up where we left off on Sunday and as always, hopefully you have listened either in person or online in advance of the time of taking this in because it does help a little bit, but not necessarily something that has to be done. I'm just thinking that maybe in post-production, I can just insert some balloons back here. We'll see what happens. And we don't want to get people too excited. We don't have that much post-production. All right. So, um, in this second to last episode on Better Together, uh, last week we talked about the importance of being known and the importance of knowing others, that that really is a both and when it comes to this idea of community. And so this week, Brian, you're talking about the necessity of your story being shown in the context of community and in the context of biblical love in community. So tell us a little bit about what you think you're going to say on Sunday. I will, but I'll also ask a question. I think I know the answer to this and it's, it's germane. It rel it's relevant to what we're talking about. So you grew up in the Midwest. If you would have gone to the store or gone to a restaurant or wherever it might be, and you would order a drink that was carbonated and fizzy, what would you have called that drink? Uh, me and my people would have called it pop. Okay. So being from the Midwest pop as well, but I didn't start from the Midwest. And so depending on where you're from or that sort of stuff I've talked about on Sunday, you might call it soda. You might call it pop growing up South of the Mason Dixon line. So, um, for the first 14 years of my life, I never lived North of Tennessee, the Tennessee, Georgia, and Florida. We called it Coke. Now the problem with that is Coke is a brand, but it is also a soda or a pop or whatever it might be. So if you went to the store or you went to the restaurant and you would say, Hey, can I have a Coke? They would respond with what kind, which we'd be like, what do you mean? What kind? I just gave you the brand name. It's a little bit like when someone says, go make a Xerox, they're giving a brand name to go make a photocopy. I bring that up because in the South Coke means everything, but it actually means something specific if we're careful and we look at it, I think that's what happened in the church, a lot to communities become to mean everything. It's about wherever we're hanging out. It's about an experience. It's about a geography. It's about a podcast and all of those are true to some ways, but it's really important that if you say Coke and you actually mean Coca-Cola that you get Coca-Cola, not they bring you a Mountain Dew or Dr. Pepper, which I've never liked. I don't know why I know some big Dr. Pepper fans that I don't want that. And it's not helpful for the scenario I'm in. And so I just want to remind us in this, that when we talk about community, we're being very specific. We're giving you a brand. We're not giving you, it means everything. So community is, is where it's not a geography, even though I live in a community, it's more an experience, a group of people. It's kind of hard to, to nail down. But what I said on Sunday is, you know, when you say, Hey, these are my people, those people where your story, that means your life, when we say story is known, grown and shown key here in the context of biblical love, that's what makes it Christian versus having a community experience, maybe in a non-Christian environment. So we said about that known, we've said about that and shown, and what's interesting about showing is that there's a little bit of overlap between knowing and showing that when we show our story, it is both a service of things that we do like being a giveaway people, but it's also the inside parts of us so that when we show the inside parts of us, by the way, about their hurts or feelings of things God's doing in our life, people are knowing us as well. So it's not quite as linear as my very waffled mind wants it to be. And so if you're engaging this conversation day around, Oh, I need to show my story and you, you limit it to just a group of people that I'm going to serve, which is good, but not talk about showing these other things that God's doing in your life, it won't hit the full aspect. So at best to keep my very poor analogy up, you'll get diet Coke instead of regular Coke. And some of you people love that stuff, but it's just nasty. So anyway, so I just wanted to get that out of the way. And so we began to talk about this idea of showing our story. And I spent some time talking about the struggle that we have of showing our story and it's not new. In fact, one of the things I wanted to bring up is that sometimes we struggle with bringing our authentic self, right? Because that's how we've defined showing, bringing our authentic self, our giftings, our time, our resources to other people. We can struggle with that. Um, accidentally it happened in the book of acts in of acts. Chapter four has this great story about everyone sharing their story and their life and their resources together. It's what everybody wants, but you start acts chapter five and there's this two people, Ananias and Sapphira who, um, in the middle of that context and the great story began to fall to some traps because one of the things that I mentioned on Sunday that I repeat here again is that when Ananias and Sapphira brought their offering for the community, they were doing a good thing. In fact, they gave half of everything, which all of us would say, that's an amazing gift. Now the challenge was, is lots of people were giving the whole thing. Here's what we don't know. Their half could have been more monetarily valuable than their whole thing. We don't know any about that, but because they were bringing half and other people were bringing the whole thing, they fell into this trap of other people thinking certain things and other people there. And that is not what community is about. And of course I didn't get in deeply too much about what happened when that occurred, but it is a reminder that even in the best of communities, the enemy has the opportunity. And this is what I'm trying to make a point to get in and to present us plausible alternative truths, which just fancy word for lie to say, we have to live a particular way. And so when we talk about bringing our authentic self, we're going to talk about what it looks like to bring the real you warts and all, with the help of the power of the Holy spirit into, and show that to others through our experiences and through our giving to each other and through our sacrificial service to each other and many other things. So I just wanted to sort of walk through that again, because even for me, someone who's teaching this, I was just telling John off podcasts. I don't feel like I really own this yet. And by owning it, it doesn't mean I don't believe it, but there's that fine line between what we believe and what sits right in us, uh, that we're able to live more naturally. It's something I'm working on. Absolutely. And I think that's one of the tension points as, as we're doing this three week series on transformational community is this is something that all of us are in process in for the remainder of our life, that there's, there's always more. And I think I had shared at one point on a previous podcast that I don't remember at the moment of, as a staff, we were sitting around looking at this document that we created, this paper on community and the conversation that ensued around the table that I was at was every single person describing the reality that, well, when I was at this point in my life, I thought, man, I've got community. And then I experienced a level beyond that. I went, wow, I didn't know that was available. And then I started to live in that reality. And then I discovered at another point in my life, there was even something deeper available. And I went, wow, I didn't even know that was available. And I started to live out of that reality. Right. It's this ongoing invitation into more. It's the beauty of the gospels. There's always more. Yeah, we have been doing this for a very long time now together. So I feel like sometimes, um, one of us are just puppeting the other person, what we're saying, but I, I wrote a note under the fourth thing we're going to talk about. And sometimes the last thing it takes a little bit longer to get to when we're going to talk about later on falling into the trap of not trusting God's heart. Many times we can begin to step into community and this is what you're saying. And we get something, but then we stop and go, that's enough, but there is more. And that does mean by nature that in every aspect of showing our story and whatever way God is calling us to do inside of biblical community, there will always be risk. And by risk, I just mean this, this uncomfortable place where we know we do not have the ability to control it. We have only the ability to obey Jesus and what he's asking us to do. And we trust him with the outcome. Yeah. So as always, the goal is to take practical next steps based off of Sunday's message. So if you haven't seen Sunday's message, pause here, we'll wait for you. Go check out Sunday's message. As we talk through the practical application that you really, you teed this up for us at the end of your message. Um, the thing that came to mind for me as I was thinking about, all right, where do we go with this was four traps that we can fall into. And, and similar to what you were talking about with Ananias and Sapphira, that they, they had already experienced a level of connection and community and it was powerful and it was dramatic. And it was the kind of thing that most people would, would give anything to have, but they fell into a trap. They fell into a trap that stopped them from experiencing the next step. I probably said this already, but I just feel like I need to go back to it again. For, if you've grown up in church, one of the things about Ananias and Sapphira that you might hear all the time is painting a picture that these people were intentionally bad people. I don't believe that's what the context of this is showing. They wouldn't have gone that far in community up to that point. They wouldn't have gone that far or even brought half, right? Because they presented as the whole, but they still brought half. I mean, that's the thing. And so these are legitimate traps that I don't think when we think about ourselves or other people that we need to paint, you know, sort of like evil mustaches around Ananias and Sapphira or other people, the enemy's good and we have to be aware of these traps. So one of the first things you talked about was we have to be willing to risk if we're going to go further into transformational community, you know, not just having our story be known and knowing the story of others, but our story actually has to be expressed. And when we say our story, that's not just more details of our story. That's our authentic self. That means gifting resources, time, right? All of us, all of who, all of what God placed in us, all of who God made us to be interacting with, all of what God placed in others and all of who God made them to be. And the first trap is not choosing to risk or not choosing to continue to risk because this is ongoing. And so one of the things that I was thinking about, and it's sort of a, you know, focus on me, focus on them. For my part, one of the places where I can choose to risk more and so not fall into the trap of not risking is just thinking about who do I wish that I knew better? I super practical who in my group of my people do I feel like, you know, and honestly we've known each other a while. I don't think I knew specifically Tennessee, Georgia, Florida. Yeah. I don't know that I've ever said that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so that's not, not something I need to beat myself up for and go, man, I am such a horrible friend to Brian. I didn't know that about your life, but it's a reminder of, there's always more to discover in the stories of others, in the giftings of others, in, in what God put in them to bring into this community. And so to ask yourself the question, who do I wish I knew better? Yeah. And, and I would add to, if you're unsure about that, ask God, who should I know better? Yeah. Because I think there are two realities. I was thinking through this aspect of there's a high probability that God has already placed someone in your circle, but say you're just trying to understand what biblical community looks like. You're like, well, I don't even know where to start. We've encouraged you to try group life, but ask God and God might do some interesting things. I got an example, a friend named Scott and a friend named Brad. Uh, and Brad was up one Sunday talking to me. Uh, we were talking about relational connection and that sort of thing in a message. And frankly, I don't remember exactly what we're talking about. But he shared part of his story at the end of when his time talking, he said, Hey, if you just like to talk about your story, different language, but the same thing, I'd love to meet you. God spoke to someone in the room that day named Scott who came up afterwards that I don't know you, but I'm supposed to take you up on that. Right. Which started for them and which I'm a part of now a different community. So you don't have to constrain it inside of people that you already know. But I would like to say that's most likely your best fishing pond with the wisdom of the Holy spirit in your life. And we'll talk about wisdom of the Holy spirit and how you do it in a second, but also don't put God in a box that he can't lay someone on your heart and it's risky to step out there. But following God, even if we don't get the response that we would want to have, it's never a bad thing. It's never a bad thing. No, not at all. And so as you're thinking about that, who would I like to get to know better? Also that can feel risky, right? I'm sure that felt risky for, for Brad to offer. Yeah. Anybody that wants to hear my story, I'm willing to share it and then realize, Oh my gosh, people might actually take me up on this. And they did actually. And then for Scott to walk up to it and go, Hey, I don't know you, but you said, so I'm going to, but the power of vulnerability there. Right. And that's this idea of the, as, as he began to show his story, he began to get known better and vice versa, back and forth. And for lots of times people are just waiting for an invitation. And I think that's a big hump in some of this. I remember moving into my neighborhood, um, 11 and a half years ago. And my assumption was that everyone in my neighborhood knew each other and I was the new person. And so what we did, Kathy and I was, is we created this moment where we have about being there four or five months. We just do it like a barbecue. And, and this is what we said. We put little notes in people's mailbox. I said, Hey, thanks for welcoming us into the community. And people like individually had been really kind and we just figured they all knew each other. Here's the reality was our barbecue was the first time some of these neighbors had ever talked. Yeah. Right. And they were just waiting. I thought we were the new people imposing on someone that they were waiting for someone to invite them into a level of community. And so sometimes we are people who wait, someone's going to be inviting me into community. And what, what happens if there's 10 people in a room all waiting for the other people to, to step in? So the question isn't per se. You know, is someone going to step in and ask me, even though we always hope that is what's kind of asking me to do. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like there's more we could talk about there, but yeah, me too. But I feel like already with time, I'm already going away. Go ahead. Yeah. Um, so again, just, just recognize that like we had talked about, you know, the enemy's really good at setting traps. And so one of the traps is creating the spaces where we're not willing to risk either out of fear of embarrassment or fear of inconvenience, or just the trap of believing that something else is true. All my neighbors know each other. And if I try to interject myself into this, I'm really just messing with what they've already got. So you know what? I'll just, I'll wait for people to approach me and you've got a whole community of people that are all waiting to be approached. You talked last week about actively choosing to find rather than waiting to be found. And that is one of the things that we can offer as uncomfortable as it is. So another trap, once you've chosen to risk and you've risked asking people about their story and you've risked offering yours, the second trap is not choosing to be authentic. And again, that's ongoing. That could be in the initial encounter. That could be in the repetition over time. And we fall into this trap of wondering what will people say if I or don't, what will people think? And sometimes that one's even more vicious. Because our ability to create the dialogue that we think would happen in their mind, that they would be far too kind to ever say publicly, can really just douse any attempts at actual connection and growth. And again, this isn't just about sharing the details of your story. This is about bringing your authentic self into the connection. So this isn't just, Hey, here's the story of my life. It's the recognition of, Hey, here's something that I could help with. Right. You know, you're driving down your road past your neighbor's house and you see him out in the driveway doing something. And it looks like it could maybe use a second pair of hands, but you're like, well, you know, I don't want to make him feel like I don't think he can do it. So I'm not right. Just say, Hey, can I give you a hand with that? Yeah. Right. It's, it's not just, and can I tell you my whole story while I'm doing it? But can I engage in this moment in your life? So let's use that and let's flesh it just for a second. A way that, you know, you can share your story and also be known. I would want someone to stop. I almost guarantee it because I'm not very handy. So I wouldn't receive that as I'm not able to do it. And so in that case, if I was really hearing from God and doing it well, and I saw someone, and if I was afraid, or I was concerned that they may think by me offering help, they can't do it. You engage the story of being known and showing at the same time, this way, say, Hey, I don't know what's going on, but I know you, it looks like to me, that's, that's pretty rough and I wouldn't be able to do that alone. Would you need any help? Right. And so what I've done is just two things. I've told you, I'm not judging you. I'm actually, I here's something to know about me. I'm saying like, if you see me and you grab by and you can help, I would love the help. This is why we're doing it. And so there's a way that we can know and show at the same time. I'm not saying it's easy. And I'm not, by the way, saying that I always think about that. Cause a lot easier to think about how I would do things than I actually do things. You, especially when you're doing a podcast, but there are ways and do that and inviting them in there. Yeah. And one of the other things that I was thinking about in this idea of the trap is not choosing to be authentic is there's times that we doubt the giftings and abilities that God has given us. And we doubt our ability to utilize them correctly in a given moment. Yeah. You know, I talked in a past episode about driving down the road and seeing somebody pulled over on the side of the road and thinking, I don't know enough about cars to help anybody. I'm just going to drive on by and God using that moment to change the way that I was thinking to recognize not everybody pulled over on the side of the road is pulled over because of car issues. If it's because of a car issue, sometimes what they need is a phone, not a mechanic to get to a mechanic. And sometimes it's just helpful to have somebody else standing over the hood going, yeah, me neither, man. I have no idea, but you're not alone in this. And, and so there, there is a tragedy. There is a tragedy. If we try to interject ourself into situations and force our giftings and force our abilities and force our resources there, there, there is a trap and a tragedy of immature showing of our giftings and resources and time and our authentic self and it's happened. And I think we've all been on the receiving end of it. We've seen people try to interject themselves into our life and it's not gone well and in response that's made us go, well, lesson learned. Um, maybe I'm keeping them out of my story, but I'm also not going to do that to others, but there's a greater tragedy. There's a greater tragedy than immature showing. And the greater tragedy is not showing at all. Yeah. There's a whole lot about authentic self that Analyze and Sapphire bring to the table. I don't want to spend any more time there just in saying that that was one of their big traps. And I think that, as you mentioned, there are times where we go, I'm not gifted in that. And so we don't say, what does God ask? So, cause, cause I want us to understand this. A lots of times God does ask us to step outside of our gifting. I think another way though, that we don't show our authentic self is we have been blessed by someone showing their authentic self and it's helped us. And so whether we realize it or not, we begin to believe that the best way to bless someone else is the way that we've been blessed. And so, you know, we have someone on staff here, Pastor Fred Clark, many, I mentioned him several times. He's just naturally gifted as some things I'm not naturally gifted at. And I have been blessed by him many times in my life. Well, I can do one of two things. Um, I'm not as gifted as that. I could go think that everyone I need to bless in my community, I need to do that way. Now, if Jesus says do it, I try, but I think that's also without getting God's confirmation, not living for my authentic self because first Corinthians chapter 12 verse 11, Romans chapter 12, Ephesians chapter four talks about spiritual giftings, wherein that every single believer has been given one at the time of conversion can be getting more, could have a lot. I think I've met a lot of people that feel like, man, you've got the full 64 crayon Crayola box, right? And I'm just dealing with the basic eight, but you know, those are how God has gifted us for particular reasons and purpose. And by the way, if you don't know some of your spiritual gifts, I imagine that you do, but if you don't just a side plug, we have a class called square one here at Christian fellowship church. If you're a part of our community, uh, actually we just held one this morning before you're hearing this podcast, but it's on a Sunday, we'll hold it again. One of the aspects in this is understanding your gifting. What happens, I think a lot of times is, is that we don't live our authentic self because we try to live out of a way or serve or show out of a way that isn't necessarily our best gifting. And it's not that it can't be done, but say I was a runner. I'm not. Uh, but if I borrowed John's shoes to run, they are shoes and it can be done, but it will be ultimately much more difficult to run in John's shoes because the size or the way his arches, the way the width of his feet is pick up a bunch of different reasons because those are his shoes. They're not mine. And so even when we think about our authentic self, it's not about this idea of intentionally, we're trying to take our faith for intentionally being dishonest. It's about taking paradigms where maybe other people have been using their gifts towards us and believe that we have to be like other people, but we don't, we know that there are specific gifts given to us and that each of us, it says in Psalms are fearfully and wonderfully made. We're a piece of art. We're made very specifically. And we show our story most of the time best when we live from those giftings. Why I say most of the time, it's God still has the power to say, do something outside of your gifting. Yeah. And that makes me think of another piece about the authenticity is I think sometimes we feel like being authentic means bringing only our best gifting rather than the whole box of crayons that if I go into every situation, only offering the gift of teaching, I am shortchanging my community and I'm shortchanging myself. And so part of me showing myself authentically in community and inviting others to show themselves authentically is they get to see the whole box of crayons. They get to see the ones that are worn down to a nub from use, and they get to see the ones that have barely ever been pulled out of the package and still look like they've got a freshly sharpened tip because I've been uncomfortable using them in the context of that community. So it's another good place to ask God, what are you inviting me to offer here? And we've talked about this last year in an episode or two on gifting is that Paul seems to have the 64 crayon box when it comes to gifts. And yet God shows Paul that oftentimes what I'm asking you to, what I'm asking you to do is operate in your weakness because it's in your weakness that God's strength is made perfect. That's part of showing your authenticity. It's not just bringing your put-together self, it's bringing your authentic self. So the next trap is not choosing to grow in discernment. And this is a tricky one because there's an adage about, you know, fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. But the goal is not to risk for a moment. The goal is not to risk for a moment in community. And if it goes poorly back away. And so Brian, how do we navigate growing in discernment without extricating ourself from community at the first sign of difficulty? I think a navigation, as you said, is very tricky. It made me think of an old adage when we were talking about crayons that broken crayons still, still color. They do. And I think emotionally, when we step into community and something goes wrong and the analogy is going to break down, but say our crayon breaks, like we're, we're showing our story and just something goes sideways. There is a temptation in my life. I can't speak for other people, but I'm a human. So I think it's a fairly human tendency to, to want to then not do some things. So navigating it, I think has several things. One is to understand, especially if you're showing your story and hurt came right. Number one, try to begin to understand through the power of the Holy spirit and conversation. Was that hurt intentional or was it unintentional? Because that creates a couple different scenarios. If, if I intentionally hurt someone, how someone shows me community needs to fundamentally change. I need to fundamentally repent some things. If it's unintentional, it doesn't mean that the hurt isn't there. It, the hurt is still there. It just means how I go about navigating that. So begin with the help of the Holy spirit and to the way you feel comfortable. Um, understand if it's intentional or unintentional in that to navigate that tension when we show and something goes sideways. Secondly, really understand what forgiveness is and what it isn't. You know, I heard actually John Orberg on a podcast. We were just talking about before mentioned this idea about forgiveness and I'm still processing it. So give me a little grace to process it. He said, forgiveness is dealing with something that in general is unexcusable. It's unexcusable when clearly he's talking about intent when it's intentional. And so we got to kind of grapple with that. They're in a broken, sinful world when we're in community, broken, sinful things are going to happen. Not God's plan, but that's the reality of it. So when we have to engage with something that's happened to us, that seems to be unexcusable, there's no reason that should have happened. It was out of their brokenness or whatever it might be. We have to understand that God does call us to forgive, right? But forgiveness isn't saying that what happened wasn't hurtful. Forgiveness isn't saying that what happened wasn't wrong or that what happened was excusable. Forgiveness is saying there's a debt that you owe me that can't be paid. Then I'm releasing to Jesus, which is the model who we're supposed to live by. Right. That's the first thing that sort of, so I think if we've been in relationships, we've stopped showing community because we're like, someone hasn't said we're sorry, so I can't forgive them. That's not really what forgiveness is. That is more restoration, right? And so forgiveness doesn't mean that restoration is supposed to happen in this community. There may be times where we realize, Hey, this isn't the community experience that God wants me to have because it's not functioning or chooses to not function in the context of biblical love. Be very careful before you step out of that. But God does call us to step out of that from time to time. And so when we think about this idea of, you know, intent or unintentional repentance or no repentance in the midst of this, that helps guide us. How then we sort of take this next step, like, am I going to continue to, to share my story, to draw with this broken crayon inside of the context of community? And, and I think that's the tension when you want to step by about having what you call healthy boundaries. Boundaries is a, probably an overused term. And that's why I love how John wrote this healthy boundaries, because there are some boundaries that frankly are just excuses for cutting ourselves off. There are excuses for not allowing the Holy spirit to get us to risk, but then there are healthy boundaries. And that's where sometimes you need the help of God through his spirit spot, speaking directly to you. And if it's a deeply complicated thing, if you're like me, sometimes it's difficult for me to hear God. I like to call it a, I have static on my line in my conversation with God, like on a phone, especially in some very specific areas of my life that God wants other people who are in that community, who you don't have that tension with, or you don't have that for them to come in and help you. And by the way, when they step in, that's them showing their story in you, that's them knowing you that's the reciprocal nature of biblical community and how it's supposed to work. So it's not calling people just to step in. And that's why I said, make discerning choices. You know, when Matthew chapter 10, when Jesus was sending his disciples out into the world, he said, I'm sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves will be wise as serpents and innocent as doves specifically. He's talking about there, what it means to be people who want to hurt them and unbelievers, but I do believe that the wisdom principle there is still the same. That we're not just supposed to be jumping out in this without discernment, but it also isn't saying that we're not going to jump in because we can't figure everything out in advance. There has to be, um, that attention. And so there's some things, John, that you mentioned about asking God, because when we ask God, not questions about others, but questions about us, sometimes it begins to reveal some things of why we have some tension showing and being known. Yeah. Yeah. There's so much in here about this, this trap of not growing in discernment of how we engage in community, not just who we engage with, but how we engage with them. Um, and so, like you said, this drives me crazy. How badly forgiveness has been taught sometimes, especially in Christian spaces, that forgiveness is equated with being a doormat that, well, you're just supposed to forgive them and keep subjecting yourself to the same thing over and over again, because that's what Jesus would do. And it drives me crazy. The other thing that drives me crazy is when we're not aware and we're not curious about what past experiences have taught me about future interactions. And so this is absolutely a place to ask God. This is not a great place for self-diagnosing because most of our protective behaviors feel completely rational, completely natural, completely appropriate. And so if it's a space that we're not willing to invite God into and say, God, I need the way that you see reality and truth to inform the way that I see reality and truth. So, God, when I think about friendships, what do I believe at a heart level? And you might be surprised at some of the things that sort of just pop up if you're not paying real close attention. Things like, well, people are just going to leave me. We've talked about this before. When we ask God those questions, he begins to reveal things that we don't even know that we believe. Both of our experiences were different growing up. I, at one point, began people were going to leave me, but mine started with more like, well, nothing is going to last. Because I moved around a lot. That was never intentional. I never heard a voice of the enemy come into my life. And if you walk into a scenario thinking it's not going to last, by definition, you're investment in the scenario. And so if I thought it was going to be moving, like the big event. So this is the true story. Um, the longest singular span of time, I'm now 52 years old that I've lived in one singular place is right now. It'll be 12 years. Some people are like, well, what are you talking about? That's crazy. Like I've lived in the same place for 30 or 40 years. For me, the great risk actually isn't bouncing from place to place. For me, the great risk is going past year five, going past year six and exploring things that God wants to do in my life that I've never had before. Because some people could have looked at a lot of my life as risky because I'm bouncing around every five or six years. But I would say that it wasn't as risky as someone thinks, because I was just repeating those same five or six years in version two, three, and four. Now I'm in a completely different unknown place. And when God revealed that to me, like, no, Brian, your risk actually here is that you is stepping out and saying, ah, being known at this deep level, you've never been there. Uh, and I didn't even know it was there. Yeah. And so it's, again, it's important that you know your story, not just the people around you and that you'd be aware of the effect that your story has had on the way that you engage in community. If you're used to bouncing around all over the place, are you aware of how you're engaging with community? Are you coming in with sort of a, you know, one hand in one hand on the doorknob sort of approach? If however, your experience is you've, you've stuck and stayed in one place for a long time and you've had deep lasting connections and now you're looking to bring other people in. Are you cannonballing into the deep end of their pool because that's what you have in these other parts of your life. And you're expecting them to have a 10 year old friendship with you right out of the gate. Are, are you aware of what your story has taught you about community, both what's helpful and what's not. And then how have you navigated the pain? Because I think pretty much all of us have either experienced pain at the hands of people or experienced pain from the absence of people. Yeah. And that pain has told us a story and that pain has created self protective measures. And in some cases it's been the, I'm never going to forgive. I'm going to wall them off. This is done. You're dead to me. And other cases it's pushed us to the other extreme of the doormat of I will do anything to maintain connection. And so that was where this idea of healthy boundaries came in was, you know, we're not just about eighties music references here on the faith forward podcast. I'm a fan of all things eighties and something just came to mind that it was an expression that Ronald Reagan used in the mid eighties trust, but verify. And so I was putting this together. I was just, I was double checking my history brain that that was Ronald Reagan. Right. And so I went to the Google and there was just this fascinating, like geek out moment for me of the origin of that expression. Ronald Reagan didn't come up with that. One of his advisors, a scholar told him that this is a Russian proverb. And so Reagan went into a meeting with Gorbachev with this Russian proverb and said it in Russian, which as best as I remember it was, trust, but verify. And Gorbachev looked at him and went, say that every time we meet, because that means something to us. And so it was this beautiful insight of this isn't the Ronald Reagan of, I'm going to show the Soviet union who's boss. This was, I'm saying something that's meaningful to you. And you're telling me this is a good way to navigate our relationship. Yeah. That for me was just this beautiful, like box opening moment of this is what it means to grow in discernment is not, this is how I'm going to treat people. I am growing in my ability to understand how people want me to treat them in unique and specific circumstances. The other thing that made me think about, the other thing that made me think about is something that I now can't remember. So we're just going to move on to the last thing. Yeah. And actually what you don't know through the magic of editing, we spliced a lot of the time out, but here, here's something that I was experiencing in the editing part that you didn't see. I know John, but also I just responded to John in a way that I want to be responded to. And this has nothing to do with biblical community. We have to knowing someone's story. If, if I, if I'm really trying to think about something and I go blank, it is completely unhelpful for people to start talking to me when the midst of that's happening. Was it this, was it this, was it this? In fact, it frustrates me because it throws me off. And I realized in that moment I was sitting here, we're talking about community, talking about knowing and helping someone, even a small area. And I'm like, huh, I don't know about that. John, about that. About that. About that. Was it this, was it this, was it this, or will it be like me and be annoyed in that way? And we'll find out the answer off podcast. What should I, I should have done, but there's just examples of that that come out. I just, I just in community with John, who's my friend, I treated him the way that I want to be treated, but I don't know his story enough to know how did he want to be treated in that moment. So I have illustration from Jesus. So now you remember, I was money. I was money. I was money. I was money. I was money. I was money. I was money. I was money. I was money. I was money. I was money. I was money. No. So the other thing that came to mind that I'd wanted to talk about and then blanked on, and now it came back was, and you know more about this than I do the section in acts where Paul and Barnabas and John Mark have to navigate how they're going to engage in transformational community because they hit a bump in the road in their relationship where it seems like they're at a bit of an impasse and they don't just jettison the whole thing, but they establish some healthy boundaries for the sake of the ministry as a whole. Yes, but also for their connection, not only as followers of Jesus, but as people that have been in community. And so it was just making me think about there's some really great examples. I feel like as we dig into the scriptures of not just biblical truth as in rules, but examples of real people navigating the messiness of connection, we talked about Ananias and Sapphira, but that, that other grouping of those three guys working through their friendship was helpful. So one of the things that that particular section of scripture, and I'll just make this quick in there that matters is, is that we often live in a world that says we have to stay in community forever in a group of people, or if we remove ourself from community, we are now no longer friends. We're now no longer, whatever it might be. That isn't what happened. They had a distinct difference and they said, Hey, we need to separate on this. So Barnabas went with Mark and Paul went with Silas. They continued, they stayed friends because later on in Acts, you see Paul now speak positively of Mark that Barnabas is there. So there are natural times where God in his discernment will say, Hey, grab a different community. And that's completely okay. This isn't, you know, anything other than following God. But even if he says grab a different community, that doesn't mean that all of a sudden the community that you're no longer in is bad. And this is good. It's time and calling and obedience. Which, and that's part of the discernment piece is the recognition, not out of your own understanding, but with God's help, recognizing these are people that I need to stick and stay with through the discomfort, or this is a time for a little bit of space to either allow something healthy to grow later or to allow something healthy to grow in its place. And so don't hear us talking about transformational community as you better find your five to nine people and stick with them forever, no matter what, because that's the expectation, but also to then not just party hop in community of, well, I was here for a couple of hours and it got a little uncomfortable, so now I'm going to go find some new people. Yeah. Which takes this to the last part of the trap of not trusting God's heart. You know, what is God calling us to do when he does it? And so, um, you know, I talked about bouncing around a lot as a kid and I developed some things that I didn't realize I developed, um, both healthy and unhealthy. One unhealthy thing that hit me one time, um, about not trusting God's heart is someone looked at me and said, Brian, you manipulate people. And now they meant that in a, in a kind way, I did not receive it in a kind way. Um, and I began to unpack that because I heard manipulation in this way that like if John, who is my friend, I would use John to get something for me. And that wasn't my heart. That wasn't that. But what God would reveal to me was because I didn't know how to get close to people because I was afraid of getting hurt. My crayon had been broken more than a few times. Didn't believe, you know, it could color anymore. My manipulation wasn't based getting something from John. It was making sure John didn't hurt me. So that means I would keep him outside of my bubble. And that is more of a defensive manipulation than it is an offensive manipulation, but nonetheless, neither one of those trust God's heart. And so, you know, sometimes, you know, we try to control people instead of trusting God when we walk into that, but God calls us in, that's why there's risk. Got to know what he has to say. Sometimes we try to manage expectations, manage the outcome. I know that was me accident. I always want to manage the outcome and it was, I don't want to get hurt. I don't want, I don't, I'm not trying to hurt you. I just don't want to get hurt. And so that matters, but we also made this note about stepping in gradually. We do tend to be binary people, zeros and ones, something or nothing, everything or nothing, but there's, there's a gradual progression in this. And there might be people that you step into biblical community with that in, I'm just going to make up a time in a year. You feel like you've known them your whole life, but there shouldn't be an expectation, right? Like, do you know them or what someone should healthfully know someone in a period of time that you've been with them with the investment that you've made? That's probably the right thing because I think what happens is sometimes we begin to step in community and we bring those expectations. You just mentioned it early on. I've got friends from 30 some odd years. I just spent last weekend with, we know each other a lot, but I can't expect to know John and John and Omi and me and other people community, no matter what, like those people know me, you can't substitute some of that sort of stuff, but that doesn't mean, Oh, because I don't have this with this group of people, like I have with these other group of people, I shouldn't have it. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. It's that idea of not trusting God's heart in some ways ties a whole lot to the past point about discernment is just recognizing what we assume in this case, not about ourselves, but about God, that in some cases, community has been really hard to find for a really long time. And so there's a distrust that we have towards God's heart for us that God must just not want this for me or it's we we've established through grit and an effort and sacrifice, a connection with a group of people. And it feels like God's tearing that away. And we don't trust God's heart, that there's something better that he's taking us to. And so we're, we're, we're fighting and clawing and kicking and screaming to hold onto this thing that, that God's actually trying to separate us from. Every time that you mentioned something like that, or so much like that, I have this, this picture in my head of a meme of, you know, European Jesus is what I always call John, right? He's standing there with this massive teddy bear behind his back, asking this little kid to give up the small one, but they couldn't. And he, in getting the big thing from Jesus required releasing the small thing. And that's why our trust in God's heart so matters. Cause sometimes when we're staring at the little teddy bear metaphor of whatever it is, it is so difficult. How could anything be better? And the question again, isn't whether or not we can see it. It's whether God asks, which is why we say this over and over again. The second name of this podcast is ask God, because all of these things are wisdom principles that God teaches in scripture about how to live life. But there are times where God says, I'm going to have you step out, but you better know that very, very clear outside of some of these wisdom principles. Yeah. And so again, that has to be a place where you invite God into conversation. God, what do I believe about you and your heart for me when it comes to community? Because for some of you, it's God, I believe you've got nothing for me in this area because my past experience confirms that reality. And for some of you, it's God, I feel like I'm just supposed to settle for something because something's better than nothing rather than believing you'd actually have something good for me. And for some of us, it's God, I don't trust you with discomfort because I've worked so hard to make this community comfortable. And for some of us community is we have connections with people, but it's not transformational community because in transformational community, there has to be a little bit of friction, right? It's the iron sharpening iron part. If there isn't a piece of you that's being, that's being, how do I want to say this? Cause there's so many ways that sound wrong. Um, there are supposed to be challenges within transformational community that help all of you grow. And for some of us, the, the distrust of God's heart is it's a fear of being made uncomfortable. It's a fear of being put into community with others that aren't like me in the ways that I prefer to have people be like me. And, you know, as I think about the group of the group of people that God has brought into my life, there are some beautiful similarities that allow us to have really good close connections. And there are some incredible places of friction and tension that have been and continue to be for my good because it challenges me to think differently, to live differently, to act differently, to love differently. And it took me a while to believe that this was actually part of God's best for me. So again, those aren't things that we necessarily process through on our own, but it's an invitation to ask God, God, what are you up to? And what do you have for me that I'm afraid of risking or trying? Yep. So hopefully this has been helpful. We've got one more episode in this series and we'll spend as much time as we're able to on top of the stories that you all are sending in for us to share about what God's doing in your life. Maybe it's in the area of community, maybe it's in the area of gifting, maybe it's just in the way that you and God interact. So whatever those stories are, we look forward to hearing them. We look forward to sharing them and we look forward to ourselves growing in this area of being a part of a transformational community because that's God's invitation for all of us. Amen. So until next time, he's Brian, I'm John. Take care.
