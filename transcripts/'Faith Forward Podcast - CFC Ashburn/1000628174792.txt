Welcome back to the Faith Forward Podcast, John Ackerman, Brian Bales, and it's fall. It's the return of the plaid. You know, we didn't even talk about this. We did not even talk about this off podcast. And that was going to be my first comment that long time viewers, maybe not necessarily listeners view this, know that it does seem that at some point or another, one of us is always wearing a version of a pattern or plaid, which again, this is not, trust me, a fashion podcast. Um, but last week we didn't, you know, maybe that we forgot, but yeah, yeah, yeah. So I don't know what this is right now, but now we're officially, we're officially, we're officially back. All right, there you go. Welcome back. So if you're new to the podcast, uh, we kicked off our newest season last week as we're at the same time kicking off a new series on Sundays and that's what this podcast is for. It's not a replacement for Sundays. It's a supplement. It's a compliment to Sundays. It's, it's the direct application. It's getting to the how after we've discussed the what and the why. And so today's going to be no different. We're going to try to take what you talked about on Sunday and really dig into the practical. We also try to be as transparent as possible because we are obviously very much in process as well. We are on the same journey. We are not leaps and bounds ahead of anyone else. And if you didn't know that already from watching this, this podcast will probably make that abundantly clear, not, not just this podcast in general, but this today, this episode, this episode. Um, and so as we always do, uh, because we know that sometimes people do for whatever reason, access this first, especially if you're accessing both the service and the podcast virtually, um, you, you bump into here before you get there. And so Brian, if you want to give us a quick recap of what Sunday looks like, and then we'll dig into the nuts and bolts today. Right. So, um, this whole series is called retuning and the idea is, are we, are we retuning our life back to the vision that God has placed? And it started two Sundays ago, this idea that we are salt, we are light, no matter what we think as believers, and that we are to be a salt and light are indispensable to the world we've called us to. That was the premise. So we started with that. And as we ended, um, last time looking at, on a Sunday, not this sermon, but the one that we looked at from the sermon on the mountain, Matthew chapter five, um, what we noticed was is that one of the big challenges to being indispensable is how, right? And so the second name of this podcast, we jokingly say, but we're serious is ask God. It's not faith forward. It's ask God. Um, and so that is behind everything we say, but as we are now making it into these next three different talks in this series, we're getting really practical around philosophy now, not principles. That's the term I'm looking for, wherein if we live by these principles with the help of the power of the Holy spirit about how to live these principles out, we believe will be more indispensable. And so we dug into the first principle, things that we're focusing a lot here, Christian fellowship church in this year, and that is this idea to be giveaway people. And so the idea of being a giveaway person is to be a servant in Mark chapter 10, verse 41 through 45, um, in, in the book of Mark, Jesus is often referred to as the son of man. That doesn't mean he's any less God. It's another theology statement that we can get to at another time. But he talks about the son of man himself. Jesus came not to be served, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many. Now that might be just great for us to read that and say, great. If there wasn't another section of scripture, Philippians chapter two, which says, let this mind, let this attitude, let this way of living being you that was in Christ Jesus, which means that Jesus, who has been referred to in scripture as the second Adam, he is the model for our behavior. So if we're to be as indispensable as salt and light, as Jesus is indispensable, one of the behaviors that we need to have principles to live by is to be a giveaway person to serve others. And that that's just the bottom line, right? But we also know that just because we know information doesn't mean we're changed by it. We talked about this two weeks ago. We're not formed by information. Information is used by the Holy Spirit to form us because we can know lots of things, but again, don't live from those truths. And so there are things that get in the way. We don't let the Holy Spirit come into our life. And where I spent the last part of our time on last Sunday is walking through what I've just identified in my own life. And frankly, I do believe they apply to more than just me. But when I sat down and I began to spend time with Jesus and I said, okay, God, I know that I'm supposed to be a giveaway person. What are the things that I am believing? And when I say believing, I'm not necessarily would tell you that I think them, but my actions would reflect that I think them. Okay. So by life, that's the idea of believing here. Things that I'm believing, some principles that I am struggling with inside that goes against me being a giveaway person. I just had a little bit of time walking through those on Sunday as you know, we're often limited. And so today we're going to expand on this. And now I really have to tell you this. People have listened to this before. John is the main content driver for this podcast, which means he takes the notes that I do or who someone else does, and then he makes his podcast. And I just saw John last night and I was just confirming, you know, that we were going to record today. And then he's mentioned, Hey, I'll send you the notes in a bit. And then he told me what we were going to do. And I didn't like it truthfully, not because it's not good, but it continues to dig in a place in my heart. And my hope that for you, as you process through this, that it'll dig in the place of your heart as well, not to make you feel guilty and not to make you feel shamed, but to help you understand maybe at a greater level, some of the things that God wants to do in your life. So that was a long winded introduction. No, that was good. So welcome. This is going to be fun. So like you said, the focus today is being giveaway people and Jesus very clearly gives us the mission. Yeah. He gives us the overview, he gives us the blueprint. But if you've ever gone to Ikea and picked out furniture, there's a difference between seeing the finished product and then seeing the box that all the pieces come in and then opening up the instructions and going, Oh, well, this is how we get to the finished product. Right. And as one of the seminal, uh, you know, influences in my childhood, GI Joe says, knowing is half the battle and it's a pretty important half and the instructions in the Ikea box are a pretty important half to getting to the finished product. But having the instructions and having the pieces doesn't guarantee you get to the finished product. No, I am. I've been to Ikea in a long time, but I have put together some furniture from Target. Sure. Right. And I don't know how many times I'm like, okay, this says, you know, item a and I pick up item B cause it looks, or I flip it the wrong way. If you look at, I will guarantee you, you know, I'm not very handy. Like John is very handy. If the box instruction says you can put this together in 45 minutes, I guarantee you I make double that time in a window. The first time I try to put together wrongly and the second time after I've confessed the sin of saying bad words after I realized it's another 45 minutes. Yeah, absolutely. And so as we talk about this idea of learning to become giveaway people, right? Last week we talked about you are salt and light and we have to learn how to become not now. We don't have to learn how to become, we have to learn how to be salt and light in different situations. Yeah. Yeah. Effectively in that situation because we do have the tendency of just taking our past experience and applying to the new scenario. Right. And so being giveaway people, we can potentially fall into the same trap of either I don't know how and so I don't, or I know how to do it in this way and so I'm just going to be a giveaway person in this way all the time. And so last week you mentioned formation by information doesn't work. The idea that just because I know something I can now, obviously I can do it and, or obviously I already am doing it. And so with this idea of becoming giveaway people, knowing is half the battle and knowing some of the things that get in the way is half the battle. But where we're going to go today is we're not necessarily going to solve anyone's problems today. And like you said, we may actually just dig around in some uncomfortable places, but the goal of everything we touch on today, it's most practical way is to invite you to then go have conversations with God yourself and to ask him about these places in you. Yeah. Some of these places may already, you know, throw up a flag as soon as you hear it. And that's a pretty good indication. That's a time to, you know, make time to go spend with Jesus. But for some of these, it's not so much a guarantee that it is absolutely for you, but it's things that maybe we just haven't considered before. Yep. So like you said, on Sunday, four things that came up for you as you were thinking through topics, categories, areas that get in the way as the first one you brought up was the long pause. Yeah. So flesh that out a little bit. So here's what I mean by long pause. Is that the adverb long before pause the adjective? Did I get that right from English class? I want you to focus. I want you to focus on the long part if that's the adverb, not necessarily on the pause. One of the things that we teach here at Christian Fellowship Church is living from the seven rhythms are rooted class that we offer on Wednesday nights and other times throughout the year. Helps us understand to live by rhythm in one of the rhythms is the rhythm of celebration and celebration isn't just throwing a party, even though it's great. It's the rhythm of Sabbath pausing. So what I'm trying to say here is not that we shouldn't pause. There is a place for Sabbath in our life. There's a place for weekly Sabbath in our life. And I do believe that there is a place for seasons of Sabbath in pausing to get refreshed by God, to hear by God well, and to make sure that we're in tune to continue to use that analogy with how the Holy Spirit wants us to work. I have to say that because I tend to be a person who doesn't pause. I tend to be a performance based person. We'll talk about that in a second. So I'm not want to talk about long pause saying that pause is bad. In fact, we teach pause. We teach rest. What the idea of the long pause is, is I think that all of us have been in scenarios where we pause something. Who knows the reason, but let's just assume a good reason that it's really, really hard to get back in. Um, say you've, uh, had to pause going to the gym because you had rotator cuff surgery. And then all of a sudden your rotator cuff has gone through rehab. You've got all sorts of stuff and you've got to find time in your schedule again. And you've realized, wow, I really enjoy this pause. I really that. And, and then something that used to be good for you that then was good for you to pause for a while. And it would be good for you to go back and do become something we don't do. And so I do think there has been some cultural things for us that have been good as a community, good as a church to pause on, uh, that are unique just to Christian Fellowship Church. But I think that certainly we just came through a pandemic season and there was a forced long pause for lots of people. And in my experiences is there's still a whole lot of people in pause mode about serving. And the question is, are we still in pause mode because that is what the Holy Spirit is asking us to do, or we have become people that just become really comfortable in the pause. Yeah, absolutely. And so again, this may find you all in very different places. And so one of the best questions to ask yourself first is what's my default. Do I default to rest and pause almost to an avoidance or do I default to work and then more work and then more work almost to the avoidance of any form of rest? And do you know why? What's your why for that default? The last thing we're going to talk about really is kind of the, if you've ever taken a test, this is A, B, C and D all of the above. D stands alone, but really is all of the above. And my default is performance. And it took me a long time to realize the reason my default is in performance is because I can get identity from wrong places in performance. If I'm working hard, at least if something isn't going well, I'm like, well, at least I was working hard. Or if I'm working hard and something is going well, I could tend to give credit to me working hard. And it's, you know, it's this interesting tension between, you know, us working in God blessing our work. And as Ecclesiastes also says, God blesses us in our sleep. He gives good things to his kids just because he wants to. And if we have a relationship with him, our first identity should be secured in who we are as his children. Yet certainly I found myself overworking. And so for me, and John is, you know, a good friend of mine. If you listen to this, you know this and John and I, we have some similarities, but he is clearly ahead of me in the pause aspect of life and working through that. And I say that with all good ways. And he's helped me understand lots of things by example, not just by talking. I know the scriptures, that's not the point. Information doesn't change you, right? But in pausing in that way. So for me, that's the reason I do it. But I do think there are other people who pause and their reasons start out to be good or maybe not even good. And you got to know your why. Because especially around the pause, the pause isn't the problem. It's whether or not this is, you know, God speaking or not. One of the questions that you asked me to reflect on is how do I know when it's rest from serving or rest in the midst of serving? Because actually we're never supposed to rest from serving. It's taking a break. It's in the midst. Those are good things. And I just said, okay, ask God, right? That's what we do. Because sometimes it's really hard to tell the difference. It's really hard to tell the difference. It is. And there's a story we use in square one in the week where we talk about serving and gifting and passion. And it's the story of Jesus in Matthew chapter 13, where he hears about the death of his cousin John the Baptist. And it says he goes away to be by himself to grieve, but the crowds followed him and he took compassion. He took pity on them and he stopped and he cared for the crowd and he healed and he taught. And you end up with the story that we teach in Sunday school about the feeding of the 5,000, right? This miraculous moment that Jesus performs in the midst of his grief while he's trying to get away to take care of himself and instead chooses in that moment to care for others. And it's really easy to take that moment of Jesus and make a philosophy of service around it of this is what it means to be giveaway people, because you just give and give and you put yourself second or last and you just, it doesn't matter what you're going through. Other people have it worse. Other people need more. Other people need you. And if you don't do it, who else will? Right? Because he's carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders, unlike the rest of us. And about five seconds after that story ends in chapter 13, just a few verses later, you get the story of Jesus walking on water and inviting Peter out under the water and Peter walking on water. And there's these two miraculous moments that if we lose sight of it, it's Jesus in the midst of his grief. There's this beautiful thing that happens between the feeding of the 5,000 and Jesus walking on water. And it's after he's fed the 5,000, he sent them away and sent the disciples away. And he went up to the top of the mountain to be alone and night fell while he was there. He took extended hours out of his mission to save the world because he was heart sick because his heart was broken at the loss of a close family member. And so if we don't look at the whole context, there are times that when we feel like we don't have it, that's absolutely the time that we're meant to serve because we discover that in our weakness, his strength is made perfect. And yet we cannot miss the invitation. And this was something that, you know, it was just one of those times that God said something to me and it was just so much smarter than me that I was like, that's, I need to hold onto that. But he said, work without rest makes as little sense as rest without work. And it's just something that I've had to hold onto in the years since because I also have a tendency to overperform. I have a tendency to over-function. I have a tendency to always find one more thing on the to-do list that I could probably sneak in today before the day ends because then I won't have to do it tomorrow except the to-do list never ends. Was that something on the to-do list tomorrow? Yeah. I mean, it's just like Jesus said, the poor you will always have, the to-do list you will always have among you. You're not getting away from it. And so work without rest makes as little sense as resting without working. And I think the interesting thing is because we have some of the same struggles, sometimes it's hard for us to talk to people who don't have this struggle. Like they're really good with a long pause, but maybe their thought process behind the long pause is based out of their insecurity. Like I'm not doing anything because I don't feel like God can use me because of this or whatever it might be. And so there was this thought that I had when processing, how do I know when I've crossed from healthy rest to unhealthy avoidance? And I'm going to take a story from another scenario and apply it here because unhealthy rest has not been my problem unless we talk about unhealthy not resting. But I have had moments in my life that I think that God has given me a moment that is a cross topic. I can apply it to other places. And so there was a particular time, a particular moment where I was still processing through what it meant to deal with some hurt that had happened in my life and specifically around an individual who intentionally or unintentionally, it doesn't really matter, felt like they had hurt me. And I had, I'd felt like truthfully, I'd felt like that I was at the place of forgiveness. I'd released the seeming offense that I'd taken to Jesus to deal with it, whatever it might be. And I thought it was good until like Jesus sort of had this moment, like, and this is how it went. I can't really explain it. It was a moment like, if I asked you to go to coffee with that person, would you do it? And internally I was like, nope, nope. That was a sign of unhealth. I wasn't there yet. And here's why we know that Jesus doesn't ask us to do anything that isn't in our best interest. And he wasn't actually saying, I want you to go to coffee with that person. He was just posing the question to me. If I asked you, would you do it now? He already knew I still had some more forgiveness issues to work through. Absolutely he did. And that was his way of graciously drawing it out of me because I could tell you, well, here's the information. Jesus won't ask me to do anything that's not in my best interest, but I wasn't transformed in that truth at that moment because I would not have been willing. And so that has helped me look into other places. So here's the point. If you want to know how you've crossed from maybe healthy rest to unhealthy rest, if God said to you, because he does speak, I want you to do blank, and it's not a debate whether he said it, that's a whole nother discussion. It was clear. I want you to serve this neighbor. I want you to serve at this place. I want you to serve in this way. I want you to do that. And inside of you, there's some things that this is, oh no, I can't, I won't do that. That's a sign that we've taken an unhealthy pause because he won't, again, ask us anything that's not our best interest. And I'm not even necessarily saying that he'll ask you to do that. He just might ask, but if I did. Yeah. Yeah. And it's so often when we dig into this space, what we usually encounter is fear of something. So when the long pause has gone on too long, is it fear of failure? Maybe I'm not able to do the thing that God's calling me to do, and I'm going to look stupid and I'm going to feel stupid, or it's not going to go well, or it's not going to be good enough. Right? So fear of failure, fear of rejection, fear of inadequacy. Those are all very legitimate reasons to not do something, but they're not meant to persist unaddressed. Yeah. And for some of us who may be on the extreme of overperformance, when maybe we step into Sabbath, we step into rest, another fear could come up. All right, God, if you asked me to step back in, I'm going to start being the overworker I was again. And that's not the point. He won't ask us in without asking us to be dependent. And so some of us are still pausing because we believe we took a healthy step, but to go back, there's no possible way to do it like you used to do it healthily or step into that. And there is. He's not asking us again to not serve. He's asking us to serve healthily from his power and his strength. And I'm always burnt out, always burnt out in the technical way or emotional way or whatever when I find myself serving out of my own power. And I could go a really, really long time and do that. But I'm kind of like the person that all of a sudden goes, goes, goes, goes, goes, goes, goes. The next thing, like they're sick for three weeks. You're like, where did that happen from? Right. So, yeah. And on the overfunctioning end, is it, you know, the fear of being blamed if I didn't work hard enough? Oh yeah. Is it the, I don't know who I am. So there is. So John, when John said that there is one of my greatest fears, one of my greatest fears that someone would look at me and call me lazy. It is a massive fear of mine that I know is not rooted in Jesus. And I know my heart, but there is a, there are so many things in my life. Like if you looked at my calendar, it's probably overfilled, but I actually fill my calendar out with almost everything I do in case someone ever comes to me and goes, Brian, you're a pastor. You only work one day a week. What do you do? I'm like, I'm not being lazy. Here it is. These are all the things. Now. It's one thing to go back and remember the things I've done to be healthy. It's another thing to feel like I need to justify that because of that fear. Worth. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. And so again, invitation is spend some time with God on this category. Are there things that you've been continuing to do and refusing to rest? And if so, why? Yeah. And if there's things that you've been avoiding for not just a healthy length of time because you needed to recover at a physical level, at an emotional level, at a mental level, even at a spiritual level. I remember one of the first times I was invited to lead a small group at a church. It was this church. It wasn't overtly stated, but I walked away from the conversation feeling like I just signed up for a lifetime of servitude. I'm not allowed to leave. This thing is apparently now dependent on me. And if I go, so goes it. And I just, I had this sense of, I'm tired already and I haven't even started. And I think that's really a key thing that happens a lot in church environments, pardon the mixed analogy. And for those of us who grew up, you know, particular age, we have some stories around hotel California, but it feels that way, right? You can check in, but you can never check out once you start serving in a church. It is a lifetime. Because frankly, lots of times as churches, we become people who also aren't dependent upon the Holy Spirit. And we become desperate to do the work of God that we want the servants there, but we get out of whack because instead of focused on those servants doing the work or filled by the power of the Holy Spirit and be healthy and rest doing it, where it's like, we got to get this done. So please don't ever leave your small group or whatever it might be. So yeah, we should probably have a hotel California, a whole message around that. Right. It's going to look good. Yeah. All right. So we could probably spend more time on that, but we're going to, but some of that was intro. It's yeah. So the second thing you brought up on Sunday that often gets in the way of us becoming truly giveaway people is a scarcity mindset. So give us a quick summary of what you meant by that. So scarcity mindset is this idea is that we're going to run out and God is not going to provide specifically how it comes with serving is, is I'm going to do this. And the two places that scarcity mindset comes up to me the most is in my finances and in my time, I'm going to do what you say, God, like I'm going to give away my time to this particular person, thing, event, whatever it might be. But then all the things I have to get done, I won't get done. And then connecting people can look at me. What'd you do all week? And you're going to be, or were you lazy just sitting at the coffee shop, right? Or that God you're asking me, especially when it comes to giving, right? I understand it's all his money, but I mean, sometimes, you know, as you make more money in life, that's an awesome thing. I used to think that as I made more money in life, I'd be less concerned about a scarcity mindset. That's actually not what happened because I've had God has said, okay, you've got more resources. Here's what I'm asking you to do. Give more of it away. And as I watched that number creep up, I'm like, and that's a number that at one point if you'd asked me in life, I'd have been just happy maybe to make that number, but that's how God works. But if God asked me again, it's not bad. So scarcity mindset, and then we'll hop into how it plays out is just simply this, our belief that the God of the universe, who is our father will ask us to do something. And when we do it, we won't have enough for ourselves. Yeah, I really appreciate, and I really don't appreciate you bringing this one up. And I hope you're feeling a little bit of discomfort listening to this as well, because I have yet to encounter someone who doesn't have some place in their heart, because this is a heart level belief. This is not intellectual understanding. This is a heart level belief about who God is, who I am, and what's true about the world around me. That in some part of my life or multiple places in my life, there just isn't enough. God won't come through. God won't provide. It's up to me. I can't do, right? Some version around that narrative of there isn't enough, whether it's finances, whether it's time, whether it's love, whether it's whatever the thing is. And one of the most important places that we can invite God into and not just put the Jesus Band-Aid on it and say, you know, Jesus, make this go away. Yeah. One of the really cool things that I've learned about Jesus, and again, I also don't like it sometimes, is that Jesus very rarely just whooshes unhealthy things away without us recognizing it. And we just wake up one day and go, huh, I suddenly don't have any problem with this whatsoever anymore. And I don't even know why, but, and in part because he loves showing us himself. He loves showing us what he's doing. He loves inviting us into the process of our transformation. But that also means then we have to be willing to step into it. We have to be willing to actually look at it. We have to be willing to invite him into it and say, Jesus, if you'll show me, I'll look like I'm not just going to cover my eyes and you gross, get it out of here quick. And it's one of these places with this scarcity mindset that we often discover that our theology is completely at odds with our heart level belief. Because we could say all the things about, oh, the Lord owns the cattle on a thousand hills, that everything belongs to God and God provides, and all we need to do is ask for our daily bread and he'll, and yet we live the reality that looks anything but. Yeah. We can say, oh, well, he has all that. But one of the thoughts is, well, maybe he doesn't really, like women say it, but that's the way we live. Or I think another one, depending on how we're going to doing in our, the fourth thing we're talking about our insecure identity is, well, maybe that cattle in a thousand hills is for everybody else. Pause. This is not prosperity theology. This is not saying when we serve Jesus, we do the things he has, everything this side of eternity is going to be good. That is not what this is saying, but it is saying that Philippians says God will supply our needs. Sometimes our needs and what we want don't always match up. Apparently there's been times in my life where I feel like God feels like I need a whole lot less time or a whole lot less finances or a whole lot of whatever than I thought it did. But that's, that's opportunities to, to trust him. And, and, you know, an example I gave on Sunday that I didn't flesh out in my notes per se is if you've ever come to Christian Fellowship Church, when I do the close, one of the reasons, one of the things I say is, is that we would love you to find out more about Christian Fellowship Church. But if this is not your place and you know this already, if you allow us a privilege, we'll help you find another place. I've had a lot of people tell me, man, that's really, and then they'll say something kind about that. The truth is that's, that's come out of a scarcity mindset to where there are times where like, oh, no matter how great this other church is or how this, like if you don't come here, we're not going to be able to accomplish our mission. Now, I never say that out loud, but the fact that I wouldn't be open to people who already are going to this church and I, I'm not a big fan of losing friends and people that I know to other churches. But if that's what God calls them to do, do I really believe that God still has something for this church in those moments where I start to get protective and I start trying to hold on and, and say, hey, you know, you should really do this, that and the other stuff. It's my scarcity mindset coming out. Yeah. Right. The big question is, what did God ask you to do? And he asked you to do that. Go. Did he ask you to be a part of here? Nope. Great. Let's help you find a place because you're supposed to be a part of somewhere. And so that's, you know, I think I've had a lot of people say that that seems to be odd compared to other churches. That doesn't mean that other churches don't have that mindset. Hear me that there's a lot of people who have the mindset we do. It just seems to be odd. I say it when I said it and I've started saying it. I started saying it simply because I needed to be held accountable for it. And if I stop saying it, then everyone who's listening to this podcast are going to go, hey, how's that scarcity mindset? How's that going? Because, you know, I can begin to think that God will withhold on me or, you know, boy, I just, I deserve more than what's happening right now. And so I'm going to do things out of my flesh and my way of thinking to justify in my mind what I think I deserve. That's another thing for another time, probably. But yeah. Yeah. And again, there's so many ways that this has gotten itself knotted around in our heart. Because again, this isn't intellectual. This is truly existing at a heart level. And none of this is designed to create any sort of sense of, of shame or condemnation because all of us have these places. This is really more about a willingness to become curious, to become more curious about what else God might be able to do in me that I wouldn't have expected. And so again, the invitation is to sit in this space with him and just ask him about the places where you might have a scarcity mindset. And the more that I've sat with him on this topic in particular, which I don't like that I don't like that. We've had to have as many conversations about it as we have, but it's, it's revealed to me just how much of my heart really does still believe there's not enough. And so here's a few examples. One, some of my scarcity mindset shows up in not asking for help because I believe other people don't have enough time to give to me. If the goal is for all of us to become giveaway people, my reluctance to ask for help actually prevents people from being giveaway people in my life because I'm convinced they don't have enough time and who am I to take up some of that really precious time of theirs to help me because I should just be able to do it myself. Right. And then there's also the financial piece, which I think is probably going to be a fairly common experience for people in, in different ways, but a common topic regardless of, like you mentioned, it seemed like at some point in life, there was a dollar figure that would have equaled comfort. And what's so funny is that, you know, our finances seem to take up whatever space we've allowed them to take up. And the more that we have in some cases, the more possessive we become of it, the more afraid we are of no longer having that. And again, it sounds cliche, but I've seen it. I've seen some really happy people that didn't have much. And I remember part of my growing up time, we didn't have much. And I remember being pretty happy because I had what I needed and I wasn't all that concerned about the rest. But I've also discovered that in this category of, of my finances, even the language of my is indicative of my scarcity mindset, because if we truly believe what we think we know and what the scriptures tell us, that everything we have is a gift from God, then there is no such thing as my money, my finances. God's given it to me and he's invited to me, invited me to be a steward of it. And being a steward means that I understand what the one who gave it to me would have me do with it. I understand his heart of trust towards me, but also that there's an assumption that I will take these resources and use them in a way that is not only consistent with his character, but is actually consistent with his desires. And anytime I started to get wrapped around the axle with a scarcity mindset towards my finances, it's usually because I've discovered a new place at a heart level that doesn't yet believe that if I truly act like a steward of God's resources in my life, there's still a part of my heart that feels like he's going to hang me out to dry. Yeah, there is a tension that you noted in the notes about, um, the truth behind a lot of this is that we feel like if we have enough, we don't have to trust God. And, uh, there's a Proverbs in Proverbs chapter 30, where, um, where the writer of the Proverbs is, his prayer is this, and when I try to repeat to myself, God don't allow me to have so much that I defame your name or don't depend on you and that sort of thing. He also makes it a pretty clear prayer. Don't allow me to have so little that I'm tempted to do things that are ungodly in there. And I've always resonated to that. God, um, truth be told, you know, I certainly would say if I'm going to fall on one extreme, the other, I'd rather have too much. I think all of us would too much time, too much financial resources, whatever it might be, but let me stay in the middle. And I do want to say this before we move on to the next. If you're watching this, one of the scarcity mindsets that I have actually connects to finances in the church. And here's how it works. There's so many people who watch online here, Christian Fellowship Church and watching this, who've been hurt by the church. And one of the ways that they've been hurt is that churches have talked about finances in a way that isn't godly. And so in the back of my head, here's what happens. The truth is we should talk about finances. Truth. We should talk about them a way that gives God an opportunity to grow us. But my scarcity mindset around not having people would say, okay, I shouldn't talk about this right now. And so I'm still trying to work around that. So I want you to hear this. When we talk about finances, this is in the main point of scarcity mindset. We are not trying to guilt trip or shame anyone, but also, you know, when you said, hey, if I don't invite them into the opportunity to serve, I'm losing out there. If we don't invite all of us to experience God's provision that he is our father and he loves us in whatever area of our scarcity mindset we might have, finances tends to be one of them, then we are missing out. And so all I want to say is I do not have this solved other than I can, I can't I love God's boldness in this category that this is one of the places where he says, test me, test me, and let me prove myself to you live in such a way that I have to come through for you and not irresponsibly, not recklessly, not in a way that is counter to what, you know, everything else I have told you about how to live, but put me to the test in this area and let me prove myself to you. And I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. And let me prove myself to you. That blows me away. Every time I come back to that, that promise and that invitation. And yet it still hasn't resolved all the heart level beliefs. So it's still very much, which I think led me a lot to the third thing. I don't know that when I wrote these, they were particularly linear, but I think we've all seen people, and this is one of the things that can get us out of tune is we've seen people have success in our mind. We define it, but not by the way Jesus defines it. And so I use the term it's temporary success. And by that, it means this is that they chose a path that wasn't the path that Jesus called. And they seem to have whatever, you know, more, more peace, more joy, more whatever it might be, but they've done it all without being giveaway people. And that is just so we know temporary. It may be temporary this side of eternity, but it's definitely temporary to be only this side of eternity that this life, as James says, is but a vapor in comparison to eternity to come. And there's no one who will get to eternity and say to themselves, Hmm, I'm really glad I traded off these 80, 90, or fewer Methuselah 969 years for eternity. It is but a blip. And so, but I do think that, that there are other things that, that seem easier. And so that, that really, I think fools us many times. One of the stories I thought about was, um, there was a church many, many, many years ago, maybe like 20 years ago now that opportunity to go to. And, uh, it just, God said, no, actually God told my wife, no, my wife told me no. And that was God's way of saying no. Uh, and it was right. It was totally right. Uh, but later on, but from the outside, it had all of these things that I would have at that point in my life deemed to be successful. And I thought, Oh, I'm going to get a chance to be a part of this team. I'm going to chance to do this. Uh, it wasn't a lead pastor position, but I was, I was actually pretty excited about not the least of which it was 12 miles from the ocean. So that was kind of nice. Um, but clearly through my wife, God said, no, well, here's what I learned. Fast forward about nine months to a year after that. Um, and I was glad I listened to my wife because the things that I thought were successful that I was seeing presenting upfront behind them was a whole different set of things that God was actually protecting me from because everything that I would have went there around this idea of success was temporary and they were now experiencing those things because there are some principles behind how they were doing things and living, especially from the lead pastor at the time that didn't line up with scripture. And so all of a sudden, all this growth and all this development that I thought they were having completely went away, which is this reminder that Jesus is most interested in our growth and development, but that growth and development doesn't look the way that the world always says it does. It has to line up to a scripture. And so don't be fooled by people who are living selfish lives instead of selfless lives and giving away. Yeah. Yeah. Use this line on Sunday that I just, I really like that. If selfishness has led someone to greatness, it's not been true greatness. Yeah. In fact, even when I wrote that line, I had to write greatness in air in quotes. So someone ever read it and said, okay, you know what? Right. But I mean, it really drives home that point of, and again, it's, we know it, but there's something deeper here that often feels like, but I have to, it goes back to the long pause, but I have to be productive. It goes back to the scarcity mindset of if I don't, there won't be enough. And it, you know, whether you're in a church or a business or whatever, the question that you've told me at, you know, pastors conventions or whatever you all do is, oh, they always ask your church. How big is your church? Right. And you see that in businesses, right? Entrepreneurs get together. How big is your business? How many clients, how many, how many widgets, what, how many, how many clients do you have on your, like, how big is it? And the pull is towards build it bigger. The pull is towards success and is so often the case. Slow feels wrong. Slow feels bad. Small feels bad. Yeah. Well, and the point is not against bigness at all. The point is what is God called you to be? A mutual friend of ours, Randy Haynes, used to be a pastor on staff for a good long time before he retired to go to Florida. I've gleaned so much from him. But one of the things that he reminded me of is like growth is applicable to the plant that you are. I, you know, I've got some crepe myrtles outside of my house that grow extremely fast, but they're not nearly as stable as the oak tree that I have. Uh, they can't reproduce themselves like the oak tree. So understanding, um, that we're not talking about against growth. It's this idea of we begin a preconceived idea of what success is. And we see it lots of times we attach it to how much, how many dollars at our business, how many people at our church, you know, all this sort of stuff. And actually success is defined simply by this obedience to God's calling your life did you listen to God? Did you obey what God had to say through his word and through his spirit? And then did you stop tinkering with it in those moments? And it doesn't feel like, um, it's working. I use the term rest, you know, which we've already used here, but I think a lot of us can get to that place where we are. We're learning to hear God. Okay. God, I'm going to obey you until this doesn't work. And it seems like this person over there is doing it in a way that you're not supposed to do it and they're seeming success, but know this, any success that you do or accomplish outside of the will of God, outside of God's ways of doing is at best temporary for the amount of years that you live here. And in my experience, it doesn't even last the full amount of years that you live here on this planet. Yeah. And what's so interesting about this as we sort of bring this episode in for a landing is the first three topics, a long pause, where have we been avoiding things that maybe God's been inviting us into? Or where have we been over functioning in places where he's been inviting us to rest the scarcity mindset. And then we talked about just now about this, this temporary success, the, the ways in which we've tried to cultivate, create, grasp, grow in order to experience a level of achievement and perhaps a level of validity, or it all ties into this fourth thing that you talked about. And it's all rooted in this one place, you know, answer D is all of the above and insecure identity. Yep. So what did you mean by that? Well, uh, I said on Sunday is just, there is a direct relationship from between my security and my identity as the son of God who loves me, protects me and will always take care of me and how well I am being a giveaway person that more insecure I am in that fact, both theologically and practically living out the less I'm going to give away because I will believe it's my job to do things only God can. I will believe that I can do things only God can. There's all kinds of things that are there. And, and I will then go, okay. If I think, I don't think, and we've had this conversation before. I don't think that, um, I just forgot his name. Who's the Prince of England. Not Prince Harry. I was using the brother William. Thank you. All right. Clearly we're not anglophiles. Um, I don't think Prince William wakes up in the morning and thinks, am I going to have enough? Sure. Good. Why? Well, he's the son of a King. I don't think Prince William wakes up in the morning and, um, and thinks about his identity in the way that we do. Listen, if we have a relationship with Jesus Christ, we are adopted. We belong to God. We are, and some of us just going to feel uncomfortable with this, but it's true. We're royalty. We have no reason to be insecure from an earthly or heavenly standpoint. Yet the more I live from that, the more insecure that I am. And by the way, I think his brother, Harry, not to get into this sort of stuff, exhibits an idea that he is royalty, but he still struggles with lots of things. It doesn't mean that Prince William doesn't struggle with stuff. He probably struggles with them differently, but just because we have a position doesn't mean we're secure in identity. He has proven that. And I think that's a great illustration for us. We have a greater King, a greater father, a greater, all of that. And the more than I can live in the security that God is my father and loves me, the better I can do these things. Because if he says, go, go, if he says, pause, pause, if he says, give, I can give time, whatever may be. If he says, Hey, I want you to do it this way, but I feel like this other person's having better success doing it differently. I'm like, well, he knows what's best and he loves me, so I can do it this way. But that is all rooted in how much I truly not just know this, but believe this. And I think going back to this formation by information, there's a whole lot of people, myself included from time to time, more times, I'd like to admit who know their position in Christ, who know their position as a son or a daughter of the almighty God, yet that is just information that hasn't made its way into their heart, made its way into their living so they can live from that truth. And when we begin to live it, that's when we truly have a transformational relationship with Jesus, transformational relationship with God, not just this sort of transactional relationship that we talk about from time to time. And there's not enough information to fix that. Nope. There's no book to read. There's no podcast to listen to that magically transforms that. The only thing that changes our understanding of who we are and who our father is, is time spent, time spent with him, not reading more about him, not learning more about him, but spending time with him and learning to hear what he has to say uniquely and personally to you about who you are, the place that you have in his family, in his household, in his kingdom, the way that he sees you, the things that he thinks are true about you and the things that he knows are not true that you hold at a heart level. Yeah. So thanks for being a part of this today. Thanks for giving us space to continue to be works in progress. You know, I have to be honest in some ways that we, we try to keep this podcast into a particular time window. And I'm kind of glad today we did, because I'm pretty sure that this could be a verbal processing out loud for several hours about where God's still working, I mean, in life. So if you've been hanging with me and John for this long, just thank you. I know that as you're on this journey, you are not alone. You're not alone on this. There are at least two other people that are on there with you and know that these two people would love to hear from you from time to time. If you want to talk about something that we've talked about, you can email us here at Christian Fellowship Church, faithforwardatcfcwire.org. And I know we'll have a great conversation about what it looks like to take our faith from something that is just on paper, in a Bible, to actually forward into every aspect of our life. Amen to that. See you all next time.
