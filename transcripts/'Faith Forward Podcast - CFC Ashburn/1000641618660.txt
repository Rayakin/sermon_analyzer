Welcome back again to the Faith Forward Podcast, which only makes sense if you just happen to watch the last episode, which we just recorded about five minutes ago. So welcome back again. I'm still John. He's still Brian. We're still in the same clothes. We haven't left the room yet. We are here for the duration, or at least till we finish this episode. That's right. So we are in the second of three weeks on this series that we're calling Giveaway People. And before we talk about any of that, I was remiss in forgetting to mention this. I was remiss in mentioning this last episode. By the way, that seems like a little bit of a tongue twister, not to get side-scrolled already from the get-go, but remiss in mentioning the fact that you enunciated that clearly. It props to you. Well, it's not the first episode today. I feel like we're hitting our stride now. 100th episode is coming up. This is episode 96, which is just strange in some ways that we've been doing this this long, which is also really kind of cool. But our request for a while now has been for the 100th episode, we would like to make that a testimonial to what God has been doing in your lives through this platform, or really not even about this platform, but just what God has been doing through your life as people who are trying to take their faith forward using all the tools and resources at their disposal. And so the request is simply this, send us an email, send us a video, send us an audio clip sharing what God is doing in your life as you are working to take your faith forward. So three-minute video clip recorded on your phone, doesn't have to be, you know, production level quality, just send it to us with you talking about, here's what God is doing in my life. Send us the audio if you don't want to be on camera, we'll put up a lovely little graphic in its place and let your voice be heard because your words are important. And if you don't want to see your words or hear your words, send us an email and one of the two of us will do a dramatic reading of your email. But we want to hear your words. And if it's me doing dramatic reading, I just said this to John in our break in between, this is Super Bowl Sunday, and most likely it will once again be a Sunday that is the anniversary of the team that I've rooted for since my youth, never being in the Super Bowl. But they made the playoffs this year and by some miracle, by some miracle, I will be doing a dramatic reenactment if they're in the Super Bowl in my jersey, just so you know. So instead of plaid, jersey, jersey for me. So maybe that's incentive, maybe that's disincentive, whatever that does for you, we would really value hearing the stories of what God is doing in your life and having that be the message of our 100th episode and sharing in this community of the faithful who really want nothing more than to walk with God. By the way, your deadline for that Super Bowl Sunday is the episode. So we would need that prior to February 11th. And so if you can get that to us, February 4th, February 5th, 6th, 7th, just begging you please don't make me do it last minute. So with all of that said, Brian, episode 96, Giveaway People, week 2, what'd you talk about on Sunday? Well, in some ways, this Sunday was attached very much, not in some ways, very much so attached to last Sunday. So when we look at Luke chapter 10, we just talked about last episode that you may have just listened to 10 minutes ago. We talked about Jesus first asked a question of the, you know, teacher of the law, tell me, you know, what's the greatest commandment? It says, love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and your mind. Love your neighbor as yourself. And then it led to another question, who's my neighbor? And then we told the story of the Good Samaritan. One of the big things in the first week we wanted to answer was, let's get this out of the way, who is worthy of giving our life away to? And the answer is everyone. Now this week, we are going to a different section of scripture. In fact, Matthew chapter 22, in the midst of a whole chapter where people are trying to trip up Jesus. Now, Matthew 22 and Luke 10 are separate incidents, but a lot of the same quotes. Jesus has sort of, so to speak, the same sermon more than a few times, the same message to different people. But another teacher of the law tries to trip him up and Jesus answers the question, what's the greatest commandment? And he gives, love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and your mind. Love your neighbor as yourself. And then he begins to go into it just a little bit more. And we go into a little bit more. So we answered the question last week, who's worthy of giving our life away to? Everyone. But then when we got to chapter 22, this week of Matthew, and we dug into the thing that they would quote, called the Shema, which is a mixture of Deuteronomy chapter six. And in this case, Leviticus chapter 19, Deuteronomy six was love the Lord your God. Leviticus 19 was love your neighbor as yourself. Every good Jewish person, every morning quoted the Shema. They said it out loud. And the Shema means to hear. And Hebrew, and for Hebrew people to hear something doesn't mean just to recognize it with a knowledge base. By the way, it means to obey. Much like we've said over and over again in this podcast, we say here at Christian Fellowship Church, our mission statement is a spirit directed church, discipling people to know Jesus as Lord. And we often camp on that word, no, and saying, we're using it the way the Bible uses it. And the Bible never separates this idea of intellectual knowledge and action when it uses the word, no, you know what you do, what you live out in the same way when they did the Shema, when they said to hear, it was a call to live this. The reason why it was so interesting that Jesus gave this is that he was dealing with some struggles that this person was trying to trap him in. So quickly, if you heard last week, there's about 613 different laws that were given the Mosaic law that people had to follow. A good way to remember it is 365 of them were no's. Things you thou shalt not do, to use my good King James version growing up. One for each day, not in 2024, we got a leap day, but that's for a different time. The rest of them were things you should do. And it was just nearly impossible to follow them all. And what had happened in that culture and in that way and in that day was, is they began to say, if we can't do them all, let's create a category that says, these are the really important ones and these are the not so important ones. Said this way, what are the ones I really have to follow and what can I ignore? And there was a lot of debate around that because, you know, as we will dive into this, there were struggles around which ones people wanted to follow and which ones they didn't. And Jesus raised them all up and said, actually, the thing behind everything, all the laws, all the prophets, they lay on the greatest commandment of the Lord, your God, with all your heart are so in your mind. But then he gave more than what the teacher that I'll ask for and gave him a second thing, because you only ask one question. What's the greatest? You said the second is like this. The second is like it. Love the Lord, your God, with all your heart and soul in your mind, and then love your neighbor as yourself. And so what Jesus is saying right there is that the way to walk in obedience, the way to walk and follow Jesus Christ is to love him. And the way you show that you love people is how you love others. And so at the end of the service on Sunday, I asked everyone in there to sort of put their hands up like this and make a triangle. If you're watching online, you can see me doing it. Just imagine if you're just listening. And that's the visual I want to leave you with as we talk through these struggles that we're going to talk about today is that everything that we do in loving our neighbor, actually, they are the recipient of it, but they are not the object of it. Here's what I mean by that. When you make a triangle, if you put God at the top of the triangle, when we do the things that we're called to do to love our neighbor, we do it as unto God, up to him and down then to our neighbor instead of across directly to our neighbor. And I talked about that again. If you've listened to Sunday, we hope that you have. Because the temptation is if I do it just for John and not as unto God, if John responds in a way that I don't like, I don't expect a list of things or not in a time that I want. My temptation to love John goes down. John's temptation to love me would go down. My temptation to love my spouse, Kathy, Kathy, to love me goes down. But when I do it as to God and they just have to be the recipient of it, their response is irrelevant. Because God is worthy of the worship, God is worthy of the love. And so what was occurring in there is they were missing that. And so they were struggling. They were struggling to obey. They were struggling over their personal preferences were. And frankly, they were struggling with just checking a box on the outside of their life. Like, well, I'm loving you, ding, ding, ding. But the heart is what mattered. And that's when I mentioned earlier on in the talk that the section of scripture from first Samuel, where God reminds Samuel, God looks, people look on the outside, but God looks on the heart. When this section of scripture says, love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul and mind. It doesn't say love the Lord your God with all you're doing. It says with your heart, our doing comes from our heart. And if our heart is right, we will do things. But the people here, some of these were struggling. We're doing things, but their heart was not right. There was a struggle of authenticity. So that was a little bit more of a setup. But over and over again, you might hear me when I talk. Hey, don't forget the triangle today, because what I love about what we're going to talk about today is we're going to get practical things because the idea of loving God first and someone being recipient while true is somewhat abstract. The things that we're going to talk about here about how to walk through some of these struggles of obeying and our preferences and being authentic, we're going to get down to some really practical things as we do hopefully every week to take our faith forward. Yeah. And so, Brian, on Sunday, you mentioned three areas of struggle, struggling because, again, the parable that Jesus is telling here, the message that Jesus is conveying, it's not a parable. For once, for once, just answering a question directly, which is really interesting because if you go to Matthew chapter 22, this is the third time he is confronted trying to be trapped in Matthew chapter 22. And it's the only time in Matthew chapter 22 he directly answers the question. And it's one of the few times I can't remember, but I think it's about six or seven. Don't hold me to that. Google it. Of all the times Jesus is confronted that he directly answers a question instead of answering a question with a question. And so he makes it so abundantly clear. And like you had said, the issue for the audience wasn't a lack of knowledge, right? Because his direct answer is something they already knew. Yes. But what his answer is getting at is the obedience and the heart behind the obedience. And so you highlighted three areas where we often struggle with this as well, because this wasn't just them, this is us, this is humanity down through the ages, that we're struggling to love God and love others as ourselves. So again, loving God, loving ourselves, loving others, struggling in the area of obedience, struggling in the area of preference, and struggling in the area of authenticity. And so as we go through the practical things today, the focus, as is so often the case, isn't on what we know and don't know. It's on what we're doing and not doing. And most importantly, the heart behind the doing and the not doing. And so we're going to keep that front and center today is that so much of this is about the heart. And I do want to say one more thing before we hop in, and I did not have time to get us on Sunday, and I didn't even really bring it up. One of the premises behind loving your neighbor as yourself is that you actually know how to properly love yourself. And the definition of loving yourself well actually comes from another section of Scripture where Jesus says, love your neighbor as I have loved you. When you put those together, our love for ourself is supposed to look like God's love for us. And then from that place, our love for our neighbor is supposed to reflect that. So that is fundamental that we're assuming in this particular conversation that we don't, that you, that you understand what it looks like properly in a biblical stance to love yourself. Because if you don't understand that, then some of these other things we're going to talk about will definitely get off on the rail. So we're assuming that don't have time to dig into that, but just in case you're like, well, I am loving other people like I love myself. But if someone looked at how you love yourself and you thought, well, that kind of puts the dis and dysfunctional, and I've done that more than a few times, but the dis and dysfunction about what it looks like to love myself the way God loves me. Well, then we'll be off there too. Yeah. And so this feels like a really good invitation to just pause for a second and allow us and allow you to sit with the question, do I love myself the way that God does? How does God love me? And do I love myself that way? And here's the thing. If even very asking that question has just made your, the hair on the back of your neck stand up, like, I don't like that. Notice what John said, how God loves me. And if, if, if we, and usually when I say the hair on the back of my neck stands up and I feel like something's wrong, when we connect those two, what I'm saying is the way God loves me is wrong because I'm supposed to love myself the way God loves me. This isn't a selfish, narcissistic, you know, list of ways that it can happen. This is actually the way that he's designed it to see ourselves in that way. So again, this is a bit of a sidetrack really quick. You want to talk more about that? You can email us at faithforward at cfcyard.org or maybe just maybe we have a sort of a buffer Sunday when we're out of a series and we want to talk about, I don't know if I like that term, but and talk about, we can go back to that. Yeah. Well, and I don't think it's as much of a side trail as I was initially thinking, because I think this actually leads right into the first question that we're going to talk about. The first point we're going to make is that, you know, in these three categories of struggling to do what God tells us to do, love him with our whole heart, love ourselves the way he loves us, and then love our neighbor the way that he loves us and we love ourselves. If the first struggle is obedience, it's just doing it. Um, two thoughts that came to mind as I was putting these notes together, and one was a mutual friend of ours at one point was relaying a conversation, uh, you know, a moment that he's having with God where, you know, God is inviting him to grow in the area of obedience. And his response back to God was, well, how, how do I get better at obeying? Right. And, you know, let me get out my pen and paper for the three points or the seven steps or the whatever. And he said, God's response was obey. How do I get better at obeying? Obey. And it's just, it's such a great answer. If you're at all familiar with the character and the humor of God that this that's really the answer. Yeah. I mean, if you think about it, God, who set up the spiritual world, set up the earthly world. If I said, how do you get better at running? Someone would go, you got to run. How, how do I, you know, there's, that's how it works. Read 12 books on it, but that's not going to change how far or how fast. It's such a, it's something that our mutual friend has said to both of us over the years. It has clearly stuck with me when I'm struggling with obedience, what is solution to obedience? They, and the reason why is that we will experience the reality of who God is. And then when it calls us to do something, it's always for our goodness, glory. And lots of times when I am struggling, if you are struggling with a bang, when it looks like to love that neighbor as yourself, that means there is a level of concern, a level of doubt in you that, that which you are asked and called to do by God is actually in my own or your own definition of good, because good doesn't always mean easy. Good doesn't always mean comfortable, but good means we become more like Jesus. And so another thought that I had around this question of what makes the struggle for obedience so real for us is in many cases, it has to do with our internal response to the person asking us to obey. It has to do with our internal response to authority and the, the path of my mind went down on this as is so often the case went back to school because that was so much of my professional experience, so much of my personal experience and most people I knew went to school at some point. And it got me thinking about what would happen when I was gone and I had a substitute teacher and the way that my students responded to the perceived level of authority of a substitute teacher relative to me. And that's not new in the 21st century. So no comments about teenagers today, because I was that way. My parents told stories about being that way. My grandparents told stories about being that way, that then when there was a perceived lessening of authority of the person that was telling them what to do, the difference between a babysitter and a parent, right? That this is as old as time that we often look for reasons not to obey when people in positions of authority tell us. And it got me thinking about, you know, this wasn't just a substitute teacher because there were plenty of kids that resisted my authority as the teacher. But then we, you know, we harken back to those Halcyon days of, well, we're going to take you to the principal's office and I can tell you today in the 21st century, that's not nearly as much of a threat as it used to be. But then there was always the, well, just wait until your parents hear about this. And I got to tell you, that was not nearly the threat anymore either. And that's not a knock on parents. In some cases it was the resistance to authority on the part of the child. And noticing even as we go to, you know, away from the home and the family and the school at a national level, as a historian, I look at the progression of the way that we have viewed leaders. You know, the easiest one to point to is the office of president of the United States and the progression in the way that society has viewed that office. I mean, you can, you can point at different points, but since the late sixties in particular, to now where if you stood in front of the president of the United States, whoever happened to hold that office, in many cases, it's a very different response than people would have had 50 years ago or a hundred years ago, and there's just, there's something that we have to come to terms with as we make this parallel between earthly authority and familial authority and professional authority and political authority and spiritual authority, the authority of the God who made the heavens and the earth, that there is something in us that struggles to obey because I don't want to, because I don't trust it. There is something that happens, whether we recognize it or not, that can reveal who we believe the center of the universe is. Put another way, who is our small G God or big G God? We understand that God, the creator of the universe, has authority because he was a creator. There's some structural things, there's some power things, there's some benevolence things that talks about God having authority that externally comes into me. But we have become a people, I don't know when it happened, where more often than not, we reflect the value of authority based internally. You hear people say like, well, that's not my congressman, or that's not my president, and what they mean was I didn't vote for them. Sure. That reflects an internal belief about where authority lies. It's interesting to say, that's not my God, and the only thing that you could say about Yahweh, who is not my God, is that I don't believe in him, but that still doesn't make him your God, right? And so when we think about obedience, one of the basic questions is, who is at the center of my universe right now? Is it me going out, or is there something, someone, some other thing from an authority structure that rightfully has that? And I think some people struggle, I know that I struggle naturally bucking up against authority from a personality standpoint, but I also think that there are people who've been on the other end of bad uses of authority, but that's why it matters, like, well, what do we believe about God? Because while we understand that humanity is made in God's image, God is not made in ours. That means at best, we're a really, really, really, really, really bad photocopy of God, right? A bad photocopy is still an image, but it's not the purity, it's not those sort of things, so it's not necessarily the question of what we believe about other people, what we believe about God when it comes to this struggle to obey, and in that moment, again, going back to hear O Lord, you know, hear O Israel, your Lord and God is one, it's not, tell me what you're talking about, where they tested their belief was when they obeyed, what were they following? Yeah, and so when you find yourself resistant to obeying, and I'm really glad you brought up the part about authority has been misused, mishandled, abused any number of times present day and throughout history, and it often leaves a bad taste in our mouth than when it comes to the topic of authority in general, and there may be times where we think intellectually that we can parse the difference between human authority and God's authority, that we can differentiate between the way we interact with human leaders and people in authority, whether it's a substitute teacher or the leader of a nation, and the way that we would interact with God, and yet, as Jesus was talking about, this really comes down to the heart, and our heart is shaped by our lived experiences. You know, man looks at the outside, God looks at the heart, as a man thinks in his heart, so is he, we are fairly convinced oftentimes that our understanding really is sufficient, that I can love my neighbor, even if I don't love myself, and it just doesn't work. I can obey God if I struggle with every other source of authority in my life, it just doesn't work. At some point, there has to be a heart level investigation of what do I believe about God and his authority as has been illustrated to me through other places of authority. There's an interesting aspect of this section of scripture that, as I was studying this sort of, you know, as I was reading, sort of dawned on me in a way I hadn't thought about it before. So we'll go back to the triangle, because a lot of times we struggle with obedience because of our personalities, but lots of times we struggle with obedience because who gets to be the recipient of the love? Do we not know? Do we not know? When they agreed and said, love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your mind, and love your neighbor as yourself, those are the greatest commandments, right? Both when they agreed in Luke chapter 10 and when it was here. Even if they did not believe that Jesus was God, and they didn't, what they had to accept and understand that Jesus was their neighbor. And because loving your neighbor was the reflection of loving God in that moment, what was interesting was the irony that they weren't loving God by trying to trap Jesus, because Jesus, no matter how they defined it, they had to agree, would it fit the definition of neighbor? So it wasn't about the value of that person. If they thought Jesus was blasphemous, which he wasn't. If they thought Jesus was a liar, which he wasn't. Even if they thought all of those things, the worthiness of the recipient does not change the call to obey God. That's where I struggle with obeying. I'm sure I'm not alone there. When I get my eyes off the recipient, instead of the object, I don't have to keep saying that right, but when I think this is more about whether this person that I'm supposed to love or this whatever is worthy of it, that's not, he is worthy of it and he's asking us to do there and that begins. And then though, there's this part, you have a 1 Samuel chapter 15, verse 23, as a reminder that rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft. Those are some big words, but it's true. There's no other thing, no other word that we can use when we understand this is to God, someone else is a recipient and we still say, I'm not going to do it than rebellion because what we're saying is, is that we believe we're better at knowing what should be done than God. Do I ever come out and say that? Nope. I can't remember ever saying that, but I can know my actions have reflected it. And so, but it's a struggle. And I think John, one of the notes you put here, one of the ways to begin to get over that struggle about how I love my neighbor better is get to know the God who asked me to love him better. The more that I know God, the more that I have a relationship with God that's deep and abiding, where I realized, man, if it was about the value of someone other than loving God all the time, and again, everyone's valuable because they're made in the image of God. Well, God should have stopped loving me a long time ago. I mean, I mess it up a lot and sometimes I willfully mess it up. Like I know, like I shouldn't do this. I just want to be mad. Yeah. I feel like, you know, whatever it might be, but the deeper and the more that I, that I know and abide with God, the more that I'm willing to listen to him. So I love some of these process, like this is how I grow in this, see who the, who I'm doing it for. And the other person is just the recipient, but then also the more I know God, the more I'm willing to obey. Yeah. Yeah. And, and I really like this caveat to where we started with, you know, how do I get better at obeying? Obey. But if you continually obey with a wrong understanding of who God is, if the heart doesn't change. If I don't, he's going to beat me with a big Jesus stick. Right? Right. Continuing to obey with a wrong understanding of who God is probably becomes detrimental at some point. And so how do I get better at obeying? Get to know who God is. And some of that will have to be experiential. It's going to be a trust me moment. It's going to be a God. I don't know if I trust you in this. And that's where the invitation to obey, to get better at obeying is maybe necessary, but then there's also all the times in between where we can choose to spend those times getting to know him. We can choose to get the, we can choose to use those times to not only discover more of who he's revealed himself to be through his written word, but also allow him to show us who he is personally and uniquely to us as we communicate with him so that the next time he says obey, we have a different understanding of who he is. I think they both go together. You know, in our struggle to obey, you know, that aspect of our fears coming in, you know, our pride coming in. I think that really sort of leads into the next one because one of the aspects that sometimes I think is a little more nuanced than just outright rebellion is this idea of preference, like our struggle around preference. It seems anecdotally and from some other extra biblical sources that one of the debates around the great commandment that they would always ask really came about differing people put the greatest commandments on based upon the ones that they preferred, like the Pharisees preferred a set, the Sadducees preferred a set, other groups, people prefer to set. The reason they prefer them could be multiple, multiple reasons, but one usually is comfort. I prefer it's, it's easier to do this than this. And so that was part of the trap. No matter what Jesus would have said, if he wouldn't have answered the way he said it, they would have gone, Oh, but what about this one? Or what about this one? They were trying to, to get people to not like Jesus, right. By pitting him against other groups of people. But I do think without a doubt, we have a struggle with preference. Even if we know that we're supposed to obey and it's not outright rebellion, I might even then take preference and say this way, selective obedience. That's another way I think to say preference. And, I think we got to come to terms with, as you said, both in selective obedience, our pride and our fear. And when I, when I say selective obedience, I really, really want to say this. And I didn't talk about this in my podcast. I just let it get away from me in time. That there are times that we begin to think about groups through, it's hard. I prefer, you know, it's really hard to love this group of people. And when we begin to label them, political labels are just one that are rampant in the church. Listen, be very clear that no matter someone's political label, we are called to love them. Period. Nonstop. My email is brianb at cfcywire.org. I'll give my direct email. If you have challenges with that, that's what we're called. Doesn't matter their political label. We're called to love them. But man, it's easier to love some groups of people. Much like I'm trying to be better in my health. I have lots of reasons I'm trying to do that, but here's what I do. I have things I prefer doing. I hate running, but I know that is an aspect of what I need to do in some ways. And I have to be a great runner, but I need cardiovascular help. But if someone came to me and said, Brian, you could get into blank shape that you need to get into for this blank health reason and never have to run. Totally would do that. Totally would do that. I, and you might have that sort of thing as well. And this is what was happening. They had preferences that I want to follow these high ones that I make high. And I don't want to follow these low ones. Let me just do that. And that is not what it's saying. So we have to, in our own lives around the preference of particular things, whatever come to grips with that. But you know, how, how do we recognize that's happening sometimes? Yeah. And I think the very first step is. As is so often the case, you have to admit there's a problem, right? You have to admit that you are someone who chooses again, maybe not to just be disobedient across the board, but who chooses obedience through your preferences. All right. God said, Jesus said that God said the greatest commandment is love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength. And some people went great. I'll love you with my mind. Yeah. I will learn about you. I will memorize stuff about you, but you're not getting in here. Yeah. Right. Or I will, I mean, look at the times that God says, um, first chapter of Isaiah. He's like, you're giving me offerings. You're practicing the festivals and the feasts that I commanded. You're burning incense. And I hate all of it. You you're, you're, you're activating your preference. God, I will do these things, but I won't do this. And God says, I don't want those things. I want your heart. I want your heart. That's what obedience would look like. Not burning the incense. Cause I told you to, and we have to recognize that we are people that do that, that that is the heart behind this struggle with preference is either the pride of, I think I know better, which is what God is, is critiquing his people through the prophet Isaiah about, you think you know better. You think, you know, the way to follow me. I've told you the way to follow me. And you basically went, yeah, but yeah, but yeah. But if I just do these things, that's close enough. And that's the struggle of preference. And again, it's, it's that, it's that triangle of loving God, as he has said, we should love him, loving ourself as he says he loves us and loving our neighbor as ourself, and when we get that triangle off, we will struggle making preferences about who we love because we'll begin to sort of think, ah, this person, and we won't say it out deserves to be loved. Even though we've said everyone is worthy of giving our life away to everyone's worthy, if we're just truthful, there are some ways of doing things, some aspects of living that inside of us, we struggle because we feel like, I don't know if they deserve that in that way. I, I have, um, something in my life that I still struggle with that, that I naturally my first is judging people that, that whine. I've got my own stuff that Jesus helped me with on that, but like whining, I just, it, it's, ah, it grates me when people whine and I discover something it's, I, well, if I'm not careful in my pride, I think, eh, but it's not about them, whether they were the biggest whiner on the planet, it doesn't matter. They're the, they're the recipient, not the object, you know? And, you know, then when I reflect probably my problem with whining is when I think about how much I whine with God and how his grace to me is there and how it's kind. But if, for example, you're not sure you're struggling with your pride or you're not sure you're struggling with this idea of preference, do you have a moment in your life, not just where it's hard because of maybe this is going to take time or maybe take investment of resources, but frankly, you're looking a little bit down your nose at them. Yeah. Yeah. We all do it. Yeah. You know, we may not lead with that, but inside, you know, we have that moment like the Pharisee did. I thank God I'm not like this publican and sinner in the corner. Right. But that's a talk from a different section of scripture. Right. And so then we also have to recognize that if it's not, pride and fear seem to be the two greatest hindrances to loving God and living this life with God. Pride, I know better and fear what happens if, and as I was thinking about this one, there were a few examples that came to mind that, that seemed to encapsulate a fair number of the fears that cultivate the struggle with preference. And so I'll just, I'll hit all four of them real quick and then we'll go back and, and dig into any of them that feel important. Every single one of these is sermon. Every, I'm like, man, this is a good sermon series, John. We may have to work on this as a sermon series in the future. Great. But four areas of fear that incidentally require a great deal of pride as well, that require a great deal of believing that my judgment, my discernment is correct, but there's Jonah's fear, the prophet Jonah, who is afraid that God won't punish people the way that Jonah believes they deserve to be punished. And his response to that is to take control of the situation, right? To activate preference. And in this case, taking control and activating his preference looks like running away, that if I don't go to where you're sending me God, then they can't be forgiven and they'll get what they deserve one way or the other. There's Judas's fear, right? Judas, one of Jesus's 12 disciples, who is so convinced that the kingdom of God is supposed to come in a way other than Jesus seems to be doing it, that he finally reaches a breaking point when he realizes the kingdom is not coming in the way he thought it was supposed to. And so, again, notice the pride and the judgment that is inseparable from his fear of something else is going to happen and it's not going to work out the way that I want, but he takes control and in this case betrays Jesus. There's Aaron's fear in the story of Moses in the Exodus, where Moses is up on the mountain, connecting with God, listening to God, being face to face with God, and Aaron's down at the base of the mountain with the people, and it seems like the people are on the verge of leaving. They're scared and afraid of what God might say or what God through Moses might say, and so Aaron chooses preference in this moment, that rather than allowing people to scatter, we're just going to take all the gold and make a calf and say, don't worry folks, here's something more accessible, here's something more digestible, don't leave, this is an approachable God, this is the God that saved you. And there's even Abraham's fear. Abraham, as God is leading him out of Ur and through kingdoms that Abraham is afraid are hostile to him or people that might be hostile to him, he tells his wife, let's pretend we're not married, and because you're so beautiful, other men will want to marry you, and I just need you to go along with it so that I survive. His fear of I might suffer causes him to take control and sell his wife, essentially, and all of us, if we're being honest about it, have to come to terms with the fact that when we're struggling with preference, what we're struggling with is pride and fear. Seriously, the more I look at this, the more I'm like, there's a whole sermon series about this because when we think about fear, the key is that fear is real, it's an emotion, God created it, there's nothing wrong with fear. What scripture talks about is the spirit of fear, and that means fear is not designed to dictate our actions, it's only designed to allow us to know that there's problems or dangers or concerns. We're to be spirit-directed people, not fear-directed people, and in each one of these scenarios, Jonah, Judas, Aaron, Abraham, instead of letting God direct them, they let their fear direct them, their flesh, and I think a lot of times that's where that struggle comes in. I think, too, especially in moments, John, and we've talked about this before, where we're called to do something and there seems to be no good choice. This is probably something that I could talk forever about and I'll try not to, but sometimes if we're just truthful in our struggle of preferences, we want to justify an evil decision or a bad decision we made by saying, well, it's not as bad as that decision. Listen, there's this old saying that those who choose the lesser of two evils often forget they still chose evil. There is a way that seems right unto man, but that is not the right way. The way is that of God, and so when he's called us into this loving relationship with others, justifying, well, at least I didn't do this, but I did this, is still not what he's calling us to do. That is wanting to do God's command by our preferences. And so, and I know we could go into a lot of different areas of that, I'm not going to love this person because this person has done this. Irrelevant because they are the recipient, not the object. Now, God will give us very specific ways to love those people who have hurt us. He's not going to put us in a bad situation and wind us being hurt again. Everything he asks us to do for our good and his glory. That's why going back to the more you know God, the more we're able to obey him. And the more we obey him, and the more we do that, our preferences based upon our choices and our belief, they begin to go to the wayside. So, I'm not going to do this because I'm not doing this because I'm not doing this, but I'm not doing this because I'm not doing this because I'm not doing this because I'm not doing this because I'm not doing this because I'm not doing this because I'm not doing this wayside. But I do also, though, want to talk about this last part, and I think there's a tension, John, for us to on the outside, still grit our teeth and do it. But on the inside, not. One of things that struck me is, is in Matthew, Chapter 22, there are three different interactions with Jesus. Every interaction was designed to trap Jesus. Every interaction from the outside, at first glance, was a very polite teacher. It didn't walk up, being mean, let's trap his head. I mean, on the outside, it seemed like everything was well, in fact, in that culture, in that time, it all seemed well, but you know, it's a trap. We talked about that in the middle of Luke, Chapter 10 as well. And it talked about this idea of authenticity. When God calls us to love him with all our heart, I said this at the top of the podcast, that is a disposition inwardly that results in an outwardly doing. Too often, though, we get it backwards. Now, don't get me wrong. There is some interaction, I don't fully understand, where our heart grows when we obey, right? And sometimes, but if all it is, is a discipline of I'm doing this, not out of love, but out of driven duty, we will miss what's happening here. And at some point, when we feel like we've done our duty and God has not responded in the way we want, we will quit, just like if we do it this way in the bottom of the triangle to other people and they don't respond, if we have a misunderstanding of God, even if we're trying to do it him, where he's the object and someone else is the recipient, we'll stop doing it there if we misunderstand that. So, become aware, like what is inside your heart when you are doing the things that you're doing? Here's something that used to be inside my heart a lot, fear. I grew up in a culture that accidentally and intentionally many times said, if you don't follow God and love him, your life will stink. And you know what I didn't want? A life that stunk. And so I lived following those sorts of things instead of, you know, what's a greater thing? Love God. And as a result, I'll have life and life to the full, wrong way of getting the things that he wanted. Yeah. Yeah. And so just take stock of what's inside. And again, notice, notice a pattern over time. Yeah. You know, notice if, as you try your best to love people and serve them, if there's just a steadily building resentment, right? I'm, I'm loving people and serving people and, and who's, who's doing that for me? Right? I just give and I give and I give and I give, and I just feel like I'm getting wrung out, right? What's up with that, God? Now, I'm not saying you can't obey your way out of that, but what I am saying is take a look at the pattern over time. If you've been trying to obey your way out of that for a couple of days, yeah, maybe stick with it a little bit longer, but if you've been trying to just obey your way out of that, just grit your teeth and bear it for a significantly longer amount of time, I'm not going to put a particular number on that, but a significantly longer period of time, and it's not changing. And in some cases it feels like it's growing. What's the definition of insanity, right? Same thing, expecting a different result. Like you, you need to get more curious about what's in the heart rather than just trying to change the outside. And that was Jesus's critique of the Pharisees, right? In whitewashed tombs, you look fantastic on the outside, but inside you're full of dead men's bones, right? You're, you're dead inside. And so become aware, like you said, become aware of what's inside your heart. It does not define you, but it sure is affecting you. What are, what is, what are you most aware of that's inside? Is it resentment? Is it bitterness? Is it unforgiveness? Is it anger? Is it rejection? Is it loneliness? Is it self-hatred? Chances are good that if you've been trying to grit your teeth and obey your way through it, and it's not getting better, that discipline isn't enough, that maybe study isn't enough, that in many cases, if we're trying to just grit our teeth and bear it over a prolonged period of time, the things that we're doing to just grit our teeth and bear it are just a lid on a boiling pot. It's not going to solve the deeper problem. And the only one that can do that is God. And so you made the joke earlier, which is also not a joke at all. Why do I listen to this podcast? Because all you all say is ask God and here we come yet again, because it's the only answer. It's not Jesus is the answer because we're in church and just like in school, the answer is always C and in church, the answer is always Jesus. This is the actual answer is inviting him into this place and not with a magic wand to just swoosh it away so I can get back to life because there again, that's preference, Jesus, I want you to do this my way, but it's the invitation to let Jesus do what he is equipped to do, what he desires to do and to do it in his way. And to submit even there to being loved as God loves you. His desire to serve you in this capacity. Again, we look at what Jesus said about himself when he came out of his baptism in the river and out of the wilderness and into the temple and picks up the scroll of Isaiah and he says, this is why I came. And he doesn't read from that list. I came so that you all would get to work. He said, I came because I have good news for the poor in spirit. I came because there are people that need freedom from captivity. There are people that do not see clearly and I want to give them sight. And there are people in darkness that need deliverance. And the good news is I can do all of this. That's the invitation. So if you've been trying to do it out of just avoiding obedience entirely or selective obedience through preference or just by trying to make it look really good on the outside and just grit your teeth and bear it through the turmoil inside, please know that that's not his desire for you. That his desire for you is that you would allow him to love you even as he asks you to love him. And also know the value that comes from inviting other people into this. This is also not meant to just remain exclusively between you and God so that everybody else only sees the polished veneer on the outside. Dark things grow in darkness. When we allow the light in, the darkness flees. Not always in an instant, not always as fast as we want it to, but this is part of loving others and being loved. But this is part of loving others and being loved as well is the authenticity of life, not just solving problems like we talked about in the last episode, but loving others, even when it's difficult, even when it's hard and allowing ourselves to be loved, even when it's difficult, even when it's hard. Amen. I would just say to that. I don't have anything to add to that. I think it's good. So, hey, thanks for hanging with us. But more importantly, thank you for pursuing the life that God wants you to have, to take the faith that he wants to have out of just a moment on a weekend and put it forward into every aspect of your life. It's not easy. It may be some significant areas of your life that you struggle with, but God's able to do immeasurably more. Ask him and he will tell you. See y'all next time.
