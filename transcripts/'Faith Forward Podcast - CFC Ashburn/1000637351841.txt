Welcome back to the Faith Forward podcast. John Ackerman, Brian Bales, week nine of this For Something Greater series. And I'm not even going to try to recap the last day. It's just too long. That would be something greater if you could recap all this in one point. Plus it'd be half that podcast I feel like by the time we got there. But over the last couple of weeks where we've gone is we've stepped from the plan to go rebuild the wall to actually rebuilding the wall to now the wall is rebuilt, but we're getting to the heart of the issue that God was after all this time, which wasn't just the rebuilding of the wall, but the rebuilding and restoration of his people. Because the truth is, is that the reason the wall wasn't rebuilt is the difficulty in inside. But I think one of the great things that certainly God is brilliant because he's God is that he knew, at least in my understanding of his scripture, that until the wall was dealt with, it would have been very difficult to deal with some of the things that now he's dealing with. Yeah. And again, in his brilliance, often he gives us something external to focus on, to bring us to the internal. That's right. Smart guy. Yeah. So this Sunday, uh, last Sunday we had you and your wife, Kathy talking about the people coming to this place of confession and repentance, but then being invited to celebrate. Yeah. So this week we're getting to more of the meat of the confession of repentance. So give us the quick highlight reel of where we're probably going to go on Sunday. Yeah. So historically, just quickly, you know, the, um, festival of trumpets first day of the seventh month, that was last chapter that we were talking about in chapter eight. It was followed by a thing called the festival of booths. It was this whole thing together. It lasted about 24 days in during that 24 days, it wasn't like they did need to confess and repent. And the focus on that was the character of who God was that joy Lord to be their strength, which means that when they then now do the next work that they're going to chapter nine, they can take confidence in it. And so what we see is when we get to chapter nine, after that was done, they take an extra day and that whole extra day now is focused on confession and repentance. Now I didn't mention this on Sunday. I don't think I will mention this on Sunday. We always do this pre this is it really strikes me not about that confession and repentance isn't important is that there's 24 days to celebrate the goodness and the greatness of God and one day to confession and repent. And I think that'll get at a lot of us when we think about confession and repentance, that we need to grovel and we need to do this for a long period of time. And that doesn't mean that we shouldn't feel bad. We'll talk about this. It doesn't mean this, but it means that sometimes we have it out of order. And so when we get to chapter nine, now we're going to delve into it in chapter nine. As I said, I know this is on Sunday, uh, could be the longest prayer in the old Testament. It's debate whether it's a prayer or whatever may be. But one of the things I brought up on Sunday was if you are not sure, if you are not really sure about where God is in your life and what's going on, the patterns of your life often reveal the truth. Our past informs our present. And so the first 31 verses, give or take of chapter nine is them praying through recognition, a confession of what's been happening in their past. And then when verse 32 comes, they move from, Hey, this is what's happened in our past. And all the times our ancestors and those who've gone before us have, have sinned against you God. Now they're going to deal with their stuff because their whole pattern of this chapter is the goodness of God, how God's people disobeyed and God's gracious response when they confess and repent, which I think by the way, could be a pattern for a lot of our lives. The goodness of God, how we, as the followers of Jesus Christ, sons and daughters of God, always obey, right. But when we come back, God is gracious and kind in his response, which then leads to in this last day, specifically, you should, and hear me this, you should celebrate the joy of the Lord as your strength, but celebrating the joy of the Lord of your strength without confession and repentance on the other end will not be the full understanding of this. And so that's really what we talked about a lot about what it looks like to confess what it likes to repent, because those are the steps to live in spiritual freedom. That's why I called this Sunday steps in spiritual freedom. And then we talked about some specific stuff that we're going to go into, especially around when we confess and we can repent that can make it for us a more meaningful process. Yeah. So as always, the goal in Faith Forward podcast is to be practical. And so for me, as, as I was looking over your notes and then realized it's been a little bit since I've read all the way through Nehemiah, like probably since the beginning of this series. So I felt like I wanted to go back. I mean, reading chapter nine just makes me want to weep. And in part, and this is always, I feel like one of the blessings and the dangers of the scriptures is it's so easy to focus on the them and the they. And you know, how could, how could they do that? How could those people, you know, man, I'm so glad we're not like that and miss the mirror that the scriptures are always willing to place in front of us. And as I was reading through chapter nine, I was just, I was once again, so wonderfully convicted by just how often that section of the scriptures perfectly illustrates my life. And again, I think so often, if we focus on the them and the they, we look at all the ways that we're not like the them and the they, and you know, so all the ways I haven't done the things that they mentioned here, but man, have I acted like that in any number of instances over the course of my life. And so even if you came to faith at the age of three and a half or five or what, you know, from a very young age and grew up in there, there are still, I would guarantee moments in your life where you either got very transactional with God or very frustrated with God. And in your heart, whether it was made manifest in reality or not, it certainly was a truth within of, I'm going to rely on something else. I am fairly convinced that either something other than God or God plus something will get me what I want. And so if you're willing, just hit pause here and grab your Bible or open up the scriptures on whatever platform you access it and slowly read through chapter nine and allow God to hold up a mirror. And for some that's, that feels like a loaded invitation because of what we've come to believe about what confession and repentance and conviction means. And so that's actually what we're going to dedicate a large portion of this episode to because one of the things that I've come to realize, and I think we've both come to appreciate is it's really hard to experience the goodness of what God has for us. It's not impossible, but it's hard to experience it if we have bad definitions of the thing that God's inviting us into. It will always create complications. It doesn't mean that they can't be overcome, you know, because God can overcome anything, but not really proper understanding what when scripture uses particular words, more importantly, when God uses these words through scripture, what he's asking and what he's calling for. And anyone who's ever been in an earthly relationship at all knows the challenges of that. I mean, if you happen to be someone who enjoys quality time and you happen to be around someone else who enjoys quality time, you can say, great, we both enjoy quality time. The problem is defining what quality is to you. If one person's idea is I want to go camping, which sounds horrible to me, and another person's idea is I want to go to the gym, which is much more my speed, well, then you've got this tension, even though you're both trying to accomplish the same thing. And I think that illustrates a lot when we have the wrong, not necessarily, we know what the word, we can say the word, but wrong meaning behind it when it's particularly used in that way, because words evolve, words become greater and they mean sort of different things. But when we go through the lens of scripture, we can't allow what they mean to us to dictate actually what they mean from scripture. That's what matters most. So one of the things that I was struck by, which isn't in the notes, but it came to me as you were talking, is the availability of confession and repentance as an interactive part of the relationship with God is always available. So if you look through chapter nine, you see that there's opportunities where God allows the people to sort of have their own way. Like if this is what you're going to choose, then okay, I will let you do that. And when the people come to a realization of this isn't what we want, this is bad, God has something so much better, they repent. And so it's through the hardship and the heartache that they come to a place of confession and repentance. But then we get to this section that you were highlighting in this part of Nehemiah where last week it was, we recognize there's a moment of confession and repentance that's needed, but no, let's have, what was it, 24 days, 24 days of worship and celebration that lead. And so it reminded me of that line of it's, it's his kindness that leads us to repentance. And so it just made me realize in a different way, I think, than perhaps I've thought of it before, that confession and repentance doesn't just only come after punishment, which I think for many of us is part of our bad definition, that confession often comes out of good things as often as it does painful and hurtful things. And so right there is an opportunity for us to talk about what confession and repentance actually means when God talks about it. That's a great example. I think there is a direct correlation in my life, and I think my life in this case is indicative of everyone's life. But since I've not lived your life, I can't say it for sure, but I feel pretty confident that there is a direct correlation between my understanding and living and truly grasping the character and the goodness of God and my repentance and confession. Because if you think about it this way, if you're in an earthly relationship and you feel like, okay, I'm doing okay, I'm doing this, my half of the relationship. And then you look at this other person, you're in the other half of the relationship, maybe a family member, maybe a spouse, maybe a child, maybe a coworker, whatever it might be. And you start extolling all the things that they've done, and you begin to compare them. And I'm not inviting you to compare yourself on a horizontal plane to other people. But if you began to look like, okay, I think I'm putting effort in on this group project known as friendship, and they're doing all of that, there is just something naturally inside us if we deeply want that relationship, we deeply want that, that's going to respond like, oh, something needs to change. You know, a confession may just be, hey, in this particular case, I've been much more self-oriented than I've been others oriented. So I believe that's the case. And you bring a wonderful point that if we wait to the moments in our life where everything has fallen apart to confess or repent, it's not that God won't forgive us. He will. 1 John 1, verse 9, 2 Chronicles 7, we talk about this on Sunday, right? But how much more would we have life and life to the full that that's what he wants for us as New Testament believers? Would it be if it didn't have to get that way first? If by getting more in the understanding of his character, more in there, that there's a probably an overused statement, but I think it's true that the closer that you get to a light, the more things you can see that may be off. We're in a somewhat dark room. You can't tell because we have all these lights pointing at us. But if I look up, I can't see the ceiling. And so I can't necessarily see some of the imperfections. But the closer the light gets to it, the more is there and the closer that we get to God, not out of a worm theology that with this horrible person, but more than we recognize there's still stuff. And then when I think I'm off topic a little bit, but it really blows me away. Like when that light gets closer in my life and I'm like, I didn't realize it was there or I put that in the corner and ignored it. I'm like, you're still being kind to me, Jesus. You still love me. You've known it's there the whole time and you and your goodness. You are doing these things. And really, while there are other things that we have to deal with later in Nehemiah, Nehemiah chapter nine is really, really God's biggest desire is relational connection in that way. Walls mattered, all that mattered, but all of that, and I wonder what Nehemiah knew and didn't know in light of this, I'm sure he had some insight, but that's really what God's getting at. And so again, wherever you are in your life, God may be fixing this. He may be working those external stuff, but more than anything, this is what he wants, a better, more restored relationship with us. Yeah. And I think that was part of what gripped me as I was reading through the first three quarters of chapter nine before we got to the section you were highlighting on Sunday, which was God's response so often, because I went through and I highlighted it and it was things like you did not abandon them. You did not stop giving them, you did not stop doing the good things, even in the face of blatant idolatry and blasphemy and just fundamentally evil behavior, you did not stop. Were there times where it also says where you handed them over to, yes, but you did not stop. You know, when I, there's a little bit debate about the exact numbers, but I feel comfortable about this. When you look at the whole of chapter nine, there's a lot of confession and our focus a lot in confession is, here are all the wrong things that we did, and we'll talk about this, but there's about 20, give or take, depending on how you count them, sins mentioned, but 74, 74 truths, 74 realities about the goodness and the character and the greatness of God. I have no idea if Nehemiah, when he was constructing this through the power of the Holy Spirit, was trying to make a theological statement about that, but I do believe it makes a statement. So much more of this focus is on the character and the response of God in light of the sins. When I think many times we approach our confession and repentance so much more about all the things that we've done wrong, and then in light of the character of God. And I'm not saying that's a horrible thing, what I am saying, I think there's a little bit of way that we can think about as we take our faith forward that makes it more impactful and more applicable in our lives sometimes than it really is. As we start to tease out some clarity and definition, it was making me think of, like when I was a little kid, this is probably similar for many people, that when I got in trouble, the expectation was I had to apologize. Go tell your sibling you're sorry. Go say you're sorry. Regardless of whether you are or not, right? Right. And so I think without realizing it, there was sort of a fundamental understanding of reality that shaped itself within me of good things stop until I apologize, right? The thing that I wanted to do was interrupted because I got in trouble, and the good thing will not resume until I apologize. Yeah. And so this idea of confession as the necessary evil to overcome the trouble we've gotten ourselves into so that good things can resume is pretty illustrative of the transactional relationship with God that we've talked about now for several years on this platform in particular, but I think it also reveals for us layers of internal reality that have been built up and maybe gone unexamined. And so when we think about confession, I think in many cases we think about it through that childlike experiential lens of confession means I got caught, I got in trouble, I now have to say I'm sorry so that I can go back to playing, so that the good things can resume, so that all the fun will continue. And so looking at chapter 9 and God's response, the 74 times where regardless of what the people are doing, God did not abandon. God did not stop giving. Sort of throws a wrench into the gears of this understanding of good things happen and then there's, you know, something that I have to apologize for which inhibits the good things that God wants to give. And so not trying to oversimplify theology, but it makes me recognize sort of a black and white transactional approach that still exists in me sometimes with this idea of confession. Confession is the linchpin in God being able to do good things in my life if I do or don't. Right. That's a great observation that if we take it back to the Jewish people, now God's, God made a promise. We've talked about in the covenant, Deuteronomy chapter 32, and we talk even farther back and we talk about Abraham, you know, he talks about bless those who bless you and curse you to curse you. That even in the midst of all the difficult things, because if you think about where the Jewish people are, the land doesn't really belong to them. I mean, they're there, but it's kind of owned by the Persians. They got to pay taxes on it. They can do all of that sort of stuff, more freedom than they had under the Babylonians, but nonetheless, it's still theirs. They still had a lot of blessings of God in the midst of that. Yeah. I mean, there are complete and total civilizations that, that, that the Assyrians pre the Babylonians, the Babylonians, and then the Persians were known to completely and totally obliterate that. It doesn't mean that there weren't still descendants, but had no cultural identity, had none of that. God's still in the midst of this, had done good things. And so it's a reminder that when we confess, it isn't the key to getting good things back. That's not it. But it does mean that when we confess, there are made good things that happen that our sin was keeping from happening. That's true. But it's the difference between, am I confessing to get, or am I confessing as a result? And you made this interesting point, right? There's this sort of, I'm apologizing to get out of trouble. That's a get statement, or for us, maybe to get something that I didn't have before versus I'm apologizing. I'm confessing because I understand the impact it had on this relationship. I understood the hurt that I caused or whatever it might be in that particular place with our relationship with God. And that fundamentally makes the shift. And again, it's just this moment where we go back to what you've already mentioned. I've mentioned a few times, it's the kindness of God that leads us to repentance. There's so much kindness here, even before that. And I love that observation just made, because see, that's the type of thing that I think sneaks in really easy. Number one, I got to confess so I get good things, or number two, when we've messed up, we still forget that good things have been happening. Maybe not the good things that we would have written our life out for, but God is continuing doing good things. Yeah. So another helpful thing that, for me at least, is when somebody actually defined what the word confession meant. And confession is obviously something that shows up quite a bit throughout the scriptures. And so we get to look at it in the Old Testament. We get to look at it in the New Testament. And this is one of those scenarios when we're talking about quality time, where some people are going to think one thing and other people know another thing, especially if you come from a liturgical background, it might carry a very specific process and what's supposed to happen, that sort of stuff. But we're looking at scripture and what it says in that way, right? Yeah. And as I always preface, anytime I'm teaching any class, I took five years of high school French and I speak it horribly. My Spanish is worse. And so Greek and Hebrew are basically non-existent in my linguistic repertoire. So all of this is just things that I've had to look up and learn. Hey, you want a little secret? Sure. A little secret for those of you who are listening to the Faith Forward podcast, my pronunciation of ancient languages is not very good, but I actually have a Bible study system that when I pull up the word, it has a little speaker and I can hit the speaker next to it and it pronounces it for me and reminds me of how poor my now skills are in languages that I want to study. So, yeah. Yeah, yeah. There are always secrets. There are. Was that a confession? We'll talk about that in a second. It may have been. It was a recognition of truth though. I've made this one so frequently. Yeah. I am bad at other languages. So, but confession in the Greek, so, you know, sorry, I wanted to go in like three different directions at the same time, but we're just going to make the point I was originally going to make that confession in the Greek is the word homologeo. I may have to click the speaker on that one to hear it pronounced correctly, but it's, if you break down those two words, you get homo meaning same and logeo or logos word. So same word. So confession in the Greek means same words. It's, I say back what has been said to me. And so in this instance, it's the kindness of God that leads us to repentance. It's the Holy Spirit's job to convict us. Yes. That when we are convicted, it's God highlighting. This is something that's true. Either true. It's unhelpful and unhealthy, or it's true because it's good and it's healthy. And confession is same words saying back to God, what has been said to us. And I think it brings same words in context there. We've mentioned this before. Those of us who are believers in the New Testament or have the Holy Spirit to speak that it is very clear here that what they've just heard was another three hours of scripture. Okay. So instead of having the Holy Spirit in them to say this, they had the Holy, they had the God of the universe working through the spoken word there. And what they're doing now is exactly what you're saying. They're going to read all this again. I mean, they read six hours a while ago. They're going to read three hours again and go, ah, same word. Yeah. It makes me think of first John one, nine, that if we confess our sins, God, who is faithful and just will not only forgive us, but cleanse us. So if we confess, that's not, I come up with my list of what I think I did wrong and maybe withhold a couple of things just in case God didn't know, or we'll save those for later. It's if God is bringing something up that is either unhelpful and unhealthy or, and so quick example from my morning this morning, the thing that I was struck by as I was reading this again was I've been really busy lately. And in my busyness, I have allowed myself to do things for God rather than spend time with God. God, I don't have time to spend with you today. I have to do all these things that, well, honestly, you've made me busy. So if you wouldn't have made me so busy, God, we could have spent more time together. And I had to confess my busyness and that I've not been spending time with you. And not as a way to get out of being in trouble or to avoid punishment. But as him pointing out, John, we haven't spent much time together lately. Have we? You're right, God, we haven't spent much time together. That's part of my confession. And then his response was, you have the time. And so my confession there is, you're right, God, I have the time, right? That is as much confession as I've not been spending the time. Yeah. And that's, that's probably the more comfortable confession, right? I did something wrong, right? You're little and you did something, I apologize. But the other half of the confession is just as important, which is the confession of the positive truth, not just the unhelpful, unhealthy truth. Both are necessary and both are confession. You brought something up that I think might be unique for just this particular time. If you're listening to this podcast, pretty recent to when we're recording it, because we know sometimes people listen much later, but this is right around the Christmas season. And this wasn't what you were particularly driving at, but it did remind me of something in my own life that I think all of us, there's a whole lot of things that happen in December about Christ, but it doesn't mean we're going to be with Christ. We have an Advent service that's coming up, you know, on a Wednesday night here, the first Wednesday in December. You can come to that, but not experience Christ. You can come to a service, you can come to Christmas Eve, you can go to all these sorts of things to where it makes you say, I've been really busy doing things about Christ, but not being, you know, and I could justify it really easy because it's my job. Maybe you can justify it differently in whatever you might do, but that's just a great example of how busy we can become doing things for Him, doing things about Him, but not doing things with Him. And because again, as you have reminded us many times, that scripture is that God needs anything from us. He doesn't need us to do anything, but He wants us to do it with us. And I think just, it just made me think, especially about this time of year, I think I'm very susceptible to what I would like to say, mistaking my calendar of events about God for time with God. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And it's that invitation into relationship that also makes me really appreciate the Old Testament word for confession, Yadah. And the very first time I ever heard somebody explain that word, it was actually in relation to the Sabbath. That as part of the ritual of entering into the Sabbath, you know, sort of a prayer of consecration entering into that evening because, you know, Friday night into Saturday, that as part of it, there was this exclamation of the word Yadah because Yadah in part means to cast off. And so it was this release from the previous week as you enter into this period of rest and preparation for a day of rest and then the coming week. And so confession is both the saying back to God, what God has said, whether it's recognition of what's unhelpful and unhealthy or what's helpful and healthy, but it's then the casting off of, right? You're not meant to carry it. You're not meant to live under the burden of what God has shown you is unhelpful and unhealthy, but that the invitation is for it to be cast off, to Yadah it, to make that a verb. And there's just something I think really beautiful about what God is clearly inviting us into when we talk about confession. So we want to kind of reiterate this in just a second, because I feel like we've already covered a little bit of space. So it's confession is for our benefit. It's not punishment. It's not transactional. It leads us to repentance because confession is not the same as repentance. And we're gonna talk about repentance in just a second. But I think just parking on that for a second before we talk about repentance and just allow God maybe in just this moment to talk to you about your understanding of confession, what you've always believed it to mean. And maybe how, what that belief, what that definition has done to make it really difficult to want to enter into the goodness of confession. So with that said, if you take a moment, we're gonna talk about repentance now. So Brian, what do you want to tell us about repentance? Well, I believe that our repentance oftentimes is connected very specifically to how very specific we are in our confession. One of the things that happens here in chapter nine is that they go through specifically the things that they have done against God. They confess that back. And I think that's something that we try to avoid even when we know that we have done something we should not have done, or we didn't do something we should have done. I think a really good example, I don't know if you've ever had someone or seen someone, it happens a lot in the political realm, given a no apology apology. It's very vague. I mean, if they didn't realize that something had been wrong, they never would have done it, but they really don't want to name it. And there are lots of reasons that that could be true. I won't tell or say why I think they do it, but I will say this. I do think that one of the things that happens is that when we do the confession before we get to repentance, when we're vague, we're missing the opportunity of all the restoration that God wants us to do. Because when we specifically confess stuff, we're agreeing with God. Yes, I'm saying this back to you. I've done this specifically. I've done this specifically. By the way, he already knows. So us specifically confessing can't do anything for him as if he needs anything from us. It's really about us. Because then we understand that God isn't just vaguely generally forgiving us. He is specifically forgiving us. Now, one of the things that often happens if we own guard for is we try to take our faith forward in this particular areas is that when we specifically confess, there's still a spiritual battle going on. We wrestle not just because we're confessing. It doesn't mean that the enemy wants to give up on the lies he's putting in our lives. So he will attempt to shame us. But again, when we recognize God already knows and he's calling us back in a relationship, he's calling the one who created us, we're able with his help to go, get away, Satan. Because the one who loved me and created me, who I've done this against, he's inviting me. Who are you to tell me? And so just know that. So specificity matters in our confession so that then we then specifically then repent. So if you have ever made it to maybe one of our conferences that we've done here, that most likely we call Encounter, the conference we've done. We also teach a class at John Leeds and Brooke Leeds, his wife. Hi, Brooke. Second shout out. Called Following God's Voice. When it gets to this point, it's not uncommon that there's an acronym that we teach people called CRCR, and it just stands for Confession, Repentance, Cleanse, Restore. So confession is the first part, saying back to God what he said to us. Repentance is now very specifically in that moment, saying, God, okay, help me to think and act differently about that. Now, at its purest definition, repentance is probably thinking differently. However, I often add and act differently, probably because I like the Romans and James connection. Romans says it's faith. You don't have to have any works. James says, though, if you don't have any works, you probably don't have faith. And so when I say think different and act differently, know this, you can act differently without thinking differently. So you have to think differently, but true thinking differently, true repentance will result in some change in behavior. So I just want to sort of be a bit technically geeky on that, that it's really just about thinking differently. But if you are thinking differently, it will result in this, and you're specifically going this. And if you're struggling, here's the thing, that the Holy Scriptures say that the Holy Spirit even helps us in how to confess better. Romans chapter 8 talks about there are times that the Holy Spirit intercedes for us when we don't even know what to say. There's a whole lot of theology I can get in around what that looks like and that, but the bottom line about no matter how it looks like, what it accomplishes is, is can we all just recognize there are moments when we're going back to God for lots of things, things that we need. But even those moments of repentance, like I don't even know what to say, how sorry I am. I don't even know how to go back. And I look at these decisions that I made in that moment where the pattern of my life was you were good, and I completely disobeyed, not because I didn't know, because I just wanted to. I wanted to do my thing. Those matters. It brings errors, but it's only possible, right, to repent. Well, if we specifically understand confession, right, and then we're not looking for it to get out of trouble, because that's not true thinking differently. That is still thinking the same, just hoping to have a different outcome. That's moving another way to say it. It's like, hey, if you have an illness of the flu, you can deal with the fever, but you still got, it's going to show up in the sniffles or whatever it might be. Just moving symptoms. And so know that. So it's important that confession and repentance aren't a transactional way to get something. I love one of the things you said, because if we're not careful, we kind of think of it a cheat code. And you and I are of a particular generation that when we think of cheat codes, at least when I do, I think of some very specific generational video games that I used to play around cheat codes. Yeah. Mario Brothers, that was mine. Yeah. Contra. Yeah. And again, we even need God to show us how badly we understand the idea of repentance, because all of us have learned some of these things wrong, simply by virtue of going through life, especially at a young age. We learned how to get out of trouble, or we learned how to get what we want by not getting into trouble, or we learned how to manipulate the people around us that might be able to punish us so they would punish us less. Yeah. And it's hard not to bring those things into your relationship with God, however hard you try and however much scripture you learn. And we really need the God of the universe to show us the reality of what's in our heart and to help us think differently, right? The main idea of repentance, and you really can't repent well if you don't understand the reality of what you've done. Right. So confession is the inevitable first part. I recognize that it's something wrong. Family or a family story that lives on in lore of two of my uncles when they were little playing outside in the yard, one picked up a brick and chunked it at the other one, hit him square in the forehead. My grandmother, their mother comes outside to, you know, make sure nobody dies and to correct the behavior. And the one uncle's response was, well, I didn't know it was going to hurt. Whether that's true or not at the young and impressionable age that he was at. Sure. Right. Dragging a confession out of him of you did something wrong is only so helpful if he doesn't understand the significance of what he did. If he doesn't understand that throwing bricks at people results in potentially catastrophic damage, right? We've really only addressed the moment and that particular situation. And what God's after is not always just the moment of bad behavior or helping us better understand there's a new alternative. It's, it really is the whole of the relationship. What my grandmother was interested in that moment is not just the preservation of both of her children, but raising them up into the kind of men that not only don't throw bricks, but don't try to hurt people in general by accident or on purpose. And I love the emphasis you bring there. I didn't know it was going to hurt, but it doesn't change the fact that it did. And I think there's a temptation in our life. We say, well, we didn't know. Well, that doesn't change the fact that it hurt the relationship we have with God and those sorts of things. Instead of being ashamed or being defensive because we didn't know, what would it look like if when God reveals this truth to us in our life, we confess back and go, oh, that's true. Because it is about not avoiding punishment, but it is about restoring the relationship. That's the goal of it. It is. Right. And, and it makes me, again, it makes me think of my grandmother and my two uncles, right? The goal in that moment was to make sure the relationship between the two of them could be healthy. Right. And so to address the pain that was caused in the moment, but also to help them both understand these are longer term consequences of these kinds of interactions. But then also at the same time, wanting to make sure that her two sons maintained a healthy relationship with her, that this wasn't just punishment and chastisement, but this is, I love you. And so I want to help you understand what happened so that you choose differently in the future. And this is the heart of God for confession and repentance. This isn't beat you down for your behavior. And this isn't make you wear the mantle of shame and embarrassment forever and ever. In fact, I know that the story about the brick throwing has come up because I've heard it and I, I was not there for it, obviously, but you could tell it also had served as a good teaching vehicle of, Hey, remember that time you threw a brick, not as a way to bring shame and condemnation, but as a way to bring you back to a place of understanding upon which to build new understanding. This situation is like that. You remember when you threw that brick? Cause you didn't realize it would hurt. This situation is like that. And so oftentimes when God invites us into places of confession or repentance, again, in this section of Nehemiah, three hours, three hours of confessing and worshiping, right? I have to imagine there was a fair amount of new understanding being built upon old understanding, a fair amount of new recognition being built upon old recognition, being able to see differently and think differently because the goal wasn't just to get them to stop throwing the metaphorical brick. It was to bring about a deeper, healthier, stronger restoration of relationship with God. And one of the things that you and I were talking about yesterday, as we were fleshing out these notes, was that restoration of relationship with God is guaranteed. Guaranteed. It's guaranteed. And I feel like this is a both and, and I didn't run this by you, so feel free to correct it on the fly, but restoration of relationship is a guarantee, but the quality of the relationship, the depth of relationship is something that we have some degree of involvement in. And so part of what God's after in these times of confession and repentance, which again can come after 24 days of celebration and worship, or can come after being handed over to their enemies for a while, is God wants to draw us even closer. Not just the legal existence of a relationship. My grandmother loved her sons. That wasn't ever going to change, but there is a depth of knowing their mother that they have the choice to enter into. And I think we, as people are listening to this, we need to hear that truth about God and be able to embrace it with his help. 2 Corinthians chapter 7, I mentioned, if my people pray, that was before this time he mentioned saying people, and humble themselves, I will heal their land. I will heal them. Over and over again, God's guaranteed response to his people is that if you confess and you repent, you are fully restored in that relationship and that relationship grows. For some of us, it's so hard to grasp that as a truth in our life, because we compare horizontal relationships as the one with God. Listen, the one thing I want us to understand is that even in our horizontal relationships, our confession and repentance is not about, in a horizontal relationship, getting that restoration back in the relationship, but it has to happen if restoration is occurring. But I think some of us have been in scenarios where we've confessed and repent, and the relationship has never been able to be restored at the level that it is. That's because we live in a fallen, broken world, and all of us, including myself, are sinful in some ways, but God is not that way. And so, I think, I just want to make sure in our lives that we are understanding what is true about God, right, is not always true this way. It can be, because we are made in God's image. But always remember, we are made in God's image. He is not made in ours. And if I begin to think about God the way that maybe I think about a relationship that I wish was better, that's not, even though steps have taken, then I might begin to think through a lens, that's how God works. And so, when we're talking a little bit, I just want to make sure that we were hearing this because I think there's a lot of us that can say, oh, well, I've tried this, so this can't work this way. And if you're not watching, you have no idea that I'm using my hands vertically and horizontally. But if you were just watching, you realize that I said vertically and put my hands horizontally, and then I said horizontally and put my hands vertically. So, I guess it was probably better that you weren't watching, but you get where we're going with it. Yeah. And so, here's another really good place to pause. And despite our best intentions, all of us have found places where we've become transactional with God. Yes. And all of us have places where we've tried to get God to do stuff that we want Him to do. And in many cases, confession and repentance has either been our attempt at a cheat code to get God to do something, or it's been something we vehemently avoided because of either what we were taught about what confession and repentance means or requires of us or tells us about God, or frankly, we just came to believe that it was no longer necessary. Yeah. And it's just, it's so interesting to me how often in the gospels people came to Jesus and basically asked for the cheat code. Jesus, good teacher, what do I have to do to get what I want? Which rules do I have to follow and which ones can I pass on? Which ones are the most important commandments? Which person should be punished more than the other person? How many times do I have to forgive? There's a whole list, right? They came looking for the cheat code. And almost without fail, His response was to tell them a story. The kingdom of heaven is like, right? He refused to give them a cheat code because there is no cheat code, because God is not a transactional God. No. There are things that move His heart. We have an effect on Him, right? As this ninth chapter of Nehemiah points out, even in, I don't even want to say misbehavior because that makes it sound way too light, but even in their misbehavior, God kept providing, but then there were also times where God provided correction and punishment. Yeah. And so you could look at that and go, well, see, He is a transactional God. He does things based on what we do, but His heart is always the restoration of the relationship. And so even when there's misbehaving, He's trying to restore the relationship. And even when there's good, He's trying to make the relationship stronger. Again, 24 days of celebration, of feasting, that leads to even deeper connection, right? That's the heart of God. And it's that heart of God that Jesus illustrated in those stories. This is what the kingdom of heaven is like. The kingdom of heaven is like a reality that you don't understand. And I can't help you understand that reality by giving you a rule in response to your question. I can't illustrate that reality by giving you a correct behavior in response to a bad behavior. I can only illustrate that reality by telling you a story that in some cases defies your understanding, right? The disciples go to Jesus and they're like, Jesus, why do you teach in stories? And He says, I teach in stories so you don't understand. There is so much in us that God is excited to restore, to help us see differently and think differently. Yeah, and that's the promise. If we confess, we repent, He will cleanse us from all of our righteousness, and then He will restore what is true. And we've implied it, but I think we may have made it almost to the end of the podcast without saying this. If you don't know, ask God. He will tell you. He will tell you. And if you feel like, hey, you can't hear God well, if you have some people in your life who are not just random people, but people that you know and you trust who are walking with Jesus, lots of times God uses them. Have them ask God, God, what are these areas in my life that you want me to confess and repent and be cleansed of and be restored in truth to better walk in a deeper growing relationship? So, you know, I ask sort of at the end, what step do you need to take on Sunday? It's kind of the same today. Ask God, what area of your life? Yeah, and it may be helpful questions like, God, what do I believe about confession? What has life taught me about repentance? Or maybe it's, is there a particular part of my life that you're inviting me to step into real confession and real repentance? Not to get rid of a bad behavior or to make up for misbehaving or to avoid punishment, but to draw me closer to you, to help me see things the way that you do. Yeah. To help me think the way that you do. Because he's always after the restoration of the relationship. So as always, we love to talk about this stuff. That's why we do 45 minute long podcasts. That's right. So faithforward at cfcyr.org, give us a shout. We'd love to talk. And putting this on the back end instead of the front end, mostly because I forgot, we're coming up on our 100th episode. And so if you made it to the end of this one, we would love to hear what God has been doing in your life and to share those stories as part of our 100th episode, to really make manifest that we are in fact better together as God brings us towards something greater. And so whether by video or audio recording, or just an email that we can read, please send us the stories of what God is doing in your life as you take your faith forward. And we can celebrate together as God brings about the restoration of all of our relationships with him. So until next time, he's Brian. I'm John. Thanks for being a part of this.
