Welcome back to the Faith Forward Podcast. John Ackerman, Brian Bales, and here we are in our third week. Yeah, actually it's our fourth week. Fourth week, counting's hard sometimes. Time goes fast. Well, you know, the truth is, John, it's hard for you, I think, sometimes to count when you're not wearing checkers or plaid. So I'm carrying that down for you. Long-time viewers, listeners have no clue that usually one of us are wearing checkers or plaids. There's also the whole math game. Yeah, especially if you're watching it, it really mixes with our background sometimes. I'm like, that was odd. I looked at last week's and like, I feel like I was looking at one of those pictures, like if you stare hard enough, the Statue of Liberty pops out. Yeah, but that's for people of a certain age. It was really in in the 80s and 90s. It was, yeah. Yeah, it was almost a little magic eye thing going on there too. It was good fun. So fourth week on this series on alien living. And if you're just tuning into this, have a couple of recommendations. One, catch the Sunday sermon. Because in this series in particular, context matters a ton. So please don't start here. Pause, we'll wait for you for as long as you need. But pause this and go check out the Sunday sermon. It may actually even be beneficial to check out a few of the earlier sermons in this series. Just because there's been a lot of really nuanced and deep, helpful, insightful information on this overarching call to holy living. And how on earth do we do that? And what does that mean? And what are some things that maybe we need to unlearn in order to do this thing that Peter's inviting us to? Yes. So today, fourth week on this series, we're once again gonna try to be practical. And on Sunday, and you're gonna give us a quick summary on this in just a second. But on Sunday, you're talking about sort of an extension of where we went last week, which is, our freedom is not the highest calling. This was last week. Showing the goodness of God is. Suffering is the call of the alien. If we're to live as aliens and strangers, inherent in that call is a call to suffering. And that alien living is counterintuitive. Yes. And so this week, especially here, we're gonna really dig into that last piece of the counterintuitiveness of alien living in a couple of very specific areas. So if you wanna give us a highlight of what Sunday morning's gonna look like and anything else contextually. Well, I think that when we say things like it's counterintuitive, what we're saying is it runs against what we naturally want to do. But we need to sort of take it deeper because Peter, in 1 Peter chapter two, talks about this war that's happening. And I think in the things that are, he's beginning to ask us in chapter two about submission. And then as he goes on in chapter three, they are so counterintuitive to what our natural flesh wants that the war is more obvious sometimes. And I know that even I was studying this and thinking about it, there's times even as I'm engaging scripture that we read it and we go, yeah, but, right? And so if today you hear some of the things you're talking about or you listened on Sunday and your natural reaction is, yeah, but actually what you're illustrating is the fact that there's a war going on between our flesh and what we want to do and the way of God and how he wants to have us live. So it brings about holiness. And when that war occurs, we have a choice to make. And here's the choice. Who are we going to follow? If we follow ourselves, we need zero help to do that. Zero help, we can do that. But if we want to follow God, the good news is, is we have the spirit in us. So even as we think about these counterintuitive, hard things, we are not left alone. Romans chapter eight, I mentioned it last week. I mentioned again this week that the spirit helps us in our weaknesses. And let's just confess, we talk about submission. We're probably pretty weak in that. And this week, as we talked about that the alien response to other people that Peter talks about in chapter three, verse nine, is that we don't repay evil for evil, revenge for revenge, reviling for reviling. Paul said it, right, in Romans chapter 12. Repay no one evil for evil. In fact, what he says as an extension of it, and one of my favorite verses later on in Romans chapter 12 or earlier, yeah, in verse 21 in chapter 12 is, do not be overcome with evil, but overcome evil with good. Which by the way, you're like, oh, well, Peter said that, and Paul said this. And by the way, when you read Peter and read Paul, you're reading the power of the Holy Spirit. But just in case, just in case we want to go, well, Jesus didn't say it, he actually did. Matthew chapter five, verse 44, verse 45, verse 46, and verse 47. And so in many ways, what Peter is doing is reinforcing what Jesus taught in the Sermon on the Mount. But uniquely in this context now, what we're looking at is it's going from something that's abstract to something that's very real. Now, don't get me wrong. When Jesus was teaching on the Sermon on the Mount, there was a level of evil and persecution. But as we move from somewhere around AD 32 or so, when Jesus is on this earth, and he's teaching this somewhere around that time, to now AD 64, even more things have changed. And one of the things I mentioned on Sunday is this, is that we're unclear about how much persecution had met the people who are the audience, people in Turkey. We know that it was starting to get really bad. In fact, that was how the slander against the Christians, how Nero so easily used them as his pawn to blame them for burning Rome when he burned it, right? So we'd, again, don't know if it's before or after, but we do know that at this point in AD 64, that the slander and all of those things had already made it out to Turkey, these churches. And it's only going to move from slander, that's all is the time to something much worse. And so when we look at this call to say, okay, well, if someone speaks and lies about me poorly, my call isn't to get even with them, to get paybacked. My call is something different as an alien, or physically, eventually someone does something, my call isn't to physically respond. Now, I wanna be really clear, we'll talk about this. Our call also isn't to sit there and take it either, if it's physically, right? Those aren't the same thing. But there's so much about this that is counterintuitive. And one of the things that Jesus says over and over again, when he's in the Sermon on the Mount, is you've heard it said, but I say to you. So what he's getting at is the heart behind it. He's taking something a little bit farther. He's taking a little bit deeper. And that's kind of what we're doing today. We always talk about faith forward, but we're gonna dig into, all right, if we're told not to repay evil for evil, why is it so hard? And what is it that keeps us captive? Whether externally captive by repaying evil for evil, or in many cases, we play the good game on the outside, but internally, we're completely captive, and we're not able to walk in the freedom that God wants us to have. So. Yeah. So like you just, well, actually, what I was just thinking of was, so we pray before every podcast. And one of the things that you said stuck out to me, which was, and I may be misquoting you in this, but the gist of it was, I don't want a reason to practice this, but I want to grow. Yep. And so this is the place of tension that we find ourselves in when we take what's written here, and we say, God, I'm not sure how I feel about some of this. I'm not sure I like some of this. I'm not sure I want to sign up for this. I wanna follow you. I want to grow. And we're gonna get this at the end, right? I don't know that I'm ever gonna pray a prayer that says, God, just let my life be awful today. But I want to believe in the truth of some of the stuff we're talking about at the end so much that if that comes, I'm able to be anchored in that. And that's what I think what it means to live like an alien. But my home isn't here. It really isn't. And again, that's the tension. Right. And some of the tension too, is that some of these things aren't easy to parse. We want the scriptures to be so black and white as to be absolutely clearly understood by any person who would ever pick it up. And while anyone can pick up the scriptures and find truth in it, I mean, part of the point of this whole series was that context matters. Yes. Right, that there are deeper levels of understanding that are necessary. And so as we talk about the practical application of where we're going today, I just need to preface it with, there's some things about what we're gonna talk about that I don't like. And I wish it wasn't that way. And there are some things about what we're going to talk about that I still struggle to accept at a heart level, that feels like it should be another way. And yet, like you said, where we're going to end, if that is the truth, and I believe it is, then there are some things that are going to stretch us along the way. And that's been part of the theme of this series as well, is that there are some things that we have to hold loosely. Yeah. And so here's where we're going. If we're going to very practically apply the instruction to not repay evil for evil and live holy lives, much like last week, there's some freedom from bad definitions we're probably gonna need. And more importantly, there may be some things that are sabotaging us in our attempts at holiness without us even realizing it. And so very first one, you know, you were already talking about Jesus with the Sermon on the Mount and you have heard it said, but I say to you, first practical thing, if there's a place where we feel like evil has been done to us, that there has been hardship and heartache and pain and wrong inflicted on us, and we didn't respond by torching someone's house or slashing their tires, we may be tempted to pat ourselves on the back and say, good job. And yes, good job, well done. But like you said, Jesus invites us to look at the heart. When he says things like you've heard it said, don't murder, don't kill people. But I say to you, if you've murdered someone in your heart, right? If you've held anger to the point that you're imagining all the things you'd like to do to them, you're actually hurting yourself. It's not, not only is it not the call to holy living, but you're actually doing damage to yourself. Yeah, so this is something that I think they're hearing. I just wanna make sure that when we talk about first Peter, we've said that the theme is that we can show others the goodness of God, but there's also this tension that we need to hear and I'm tensing the right word, but let's say dual impact is a better term. One, when we don't do this, we show others the goodness of God. But also when we don't do this, believe it or not, it's actually in our best interest, not just theirs. And that's sometimes like, how can we not, how could this be in my best interest, I guess, to not just take out on this person in kind? Cause there's something naturally inside of this that's payback. Yeah. We wanna do that. I've been watching more football on the weekends. I don't know why, but you know, you notice, right? Almost the guy, the second guy always gets it, the payback guy. He's the one, the flag always gets thrown on and mentioned something like that on Sunday, but just our natural response to wrong being done to us is let's get it back. And so one of the things you mentioned on Sunday was this line where the Lord says, vengeance is mine. And one of the things we were talking about just before we hit record is just how good a gauge that is of what we believe at a heart level, about ourself, about God and about the world around us. So talk a little bit about what that was sort of bringing up in you. Sure. Well, the first is the reason why vengeance belongs to God is because he's the best judge. He actually knows the heart. And scripture, by the way, does say that there is a time where God is bringing judgment. Our struggle is sometimes we just don't like when, how much and how, probably some other things around that. And so when we have this sort of desire for payback and when we're holding on to, even if we don't do it, do payback, or we want to do it, but we do it, we're holding on to unforgiveness or bitterness. There was this question, right? That John, that you and I ask ourselves, we ask other people, people have asked us, what is it in that moment? When I desire payback, when I feel like I have to do vengeance, what am I believing about myself? What am I believing about others? What am I believing about God? Any of those three or all of those three at the same time. And so it's really one of those good diagnosis questions and to take your faith forward and just being brutally honest with ourselves. What am I believing? Well, sometimes if I want to take out vengeance in others, I believe that no one else is going to protect me, but me. I believe that. Did I ever say that at the time before I did it? No, but in reflection, or what I believe about others, I believe they have it coming to them. And so they deserve what's going to happen because I make an assessment about their intention, about their heart, about their wiring. It says they deserve what's coming to them, right? Because that's a pretty common thing that we would say in culture, right? You get what you pay for. Or another one is like, is what I believe about God. God is going to let them off. If you ever noticed how we so desperately love grace for ourselves, but struggle it with other people. God is going to give them the pass and I don't feel like they should get a pass. And since I don't feel like they should get a pass, I need to be the one. Well, that's one of the questions. And we can talk about that and we will talk about that. But one of the great things is I'm just really glad to have this moments that God does not look through the same lens that I do when he looks at me. Like the way that I want to repay as others that hurt me is not the way that he repaid when I hurt him. Or when I do hurt him, or when I have hurt him, or when I continually hurt him. And so, it's this idea. But I think as we were talking about this idea that even if we, yay, I didn't verbally take it out. I didn't respond on social media like I wanted to. Or I didn't yell at that family member or someone like I wanted to. I didn't rip off this email. Pick whatever sort of way that we think about retaliation. Sometimes it's more physical. Sometimes it's more verbal. Sometimes it's frankly emotional. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm just gonna cold freeze them out. I'm gonna shut them down. That'll show them, right? Whatever it may be. Really, okay, so we didn't do that. Great, that is good. But that doesn't mean, again, that's everything because there's a whole lot of us that say, well, I didn't do things on the outside, but we're still carrying that lack of forgiveness that is basically the root of our desire for revenge behind that. And forgiveness, though, is, we use this term, right? Presenting issue, I guess we've talked about that. Maybe someone explain this to me one time and I like the visual of it. If you think about presenting issues versus the actual issues, and you're like, that seems really technical, just think about the fact that if you ever put a pot with water in it on the stove and you turn the heat up, if you put a lid on it, eventually that lid is gonna rattle, right? The rattling is the presenting issue. You can remove, but you still got heat, right? So what God's interested in at the heart level is, yeah, he doesn't want the rattle, but it doesn't do us any good to just remove the rattle, say, okay, great. Well, in this case, I don't have a forgiveness issue, but not understand what the root of it, where's the heat? Why did it even show up in the first place? And there's a really big four-letter word that we threw around. I'm laughing, but there's nothing to laugh about. That was one of those moments when you're uncomfortable and you laugh, called an idol, right? Expand on that. Yeah, so again, when we're looking at this practically, we're celebrating the fact that we did not retaliate physically, verbally, whatever, but if we've been retaliating in our heart, we're keeping ourselves from the life that Jesus calls us to and we're actually allowing that pain, that bitterness, that resentment, that rage, that frustration, that judgment, that self-righteousness, that indignation, whatever that thing is, whatever that heat is, is actually fundamentally distorting our view of reality. It's keeping us from seeing the way that God does. And anything that keeps us from seeing the way that God does, thinking the way that God does, or seeing God as he is, is that wonderful four-letter word, an idol. It's anything that we put in front of God and allow it, rather than God, to tell us what's true about ourself, about others, or about God himself, right? And so that idol becomes that person or that event where we suffered a legitimate injustice, where we suffered pain, where we suffered hardship, we suffered evil, and it stays right here in front of your face and it becomes the lens through which you see everything else about yourself, about God, and about the world around you. And that thing begins to become your source of truth for who you really are, for what you're worth, in the world's eyes or in God's eyes, even, or in your own eyes, of what's true. And that is the absolute definition of idolatry, is anything that we put in front of God, anything that we put in the place that God is supposed to have in our life, that cannot do for us what only God is meant to do, but we leave it there anyway because it feels more true or it feels better. It feels better for me to rehearse the things I'd love to do to that person that wronged me, rather than even begin, rather than even begin to address the possibility of releasing that person. Yeah, it's really interesting. You mentioned the word rehearse and it just kind of like rang a Pavlovian bell in my head about another term that I use called scenario building. And if you find yourself in this moment where you have been done an injustice, one of the good questions around your ability to forgive, those people who say forgive and forget, you don't forget, right? But in light of that is, am I scenario building around this? Things like, well, if they say this, I'm gonna say this. If this happens next time, this is how I'm not gonna make it happen. And by the way, there's an appropriate place for boundaries. The type of stuff that I'm talking when I say scenario building is that place in there where we're inviting our flesh and our way to create in our mind and in our hearts, all the ways we're gonna react if or when this happens again. Instead of inviting God's spirit in to say, okay, if this happens again, God, how are you asking me to do? And there's something fundamentally different between those two. Because God can then give you a scenario that he wants you to process through. But I've just discovered that rarely that's what he does. But man, I'm really good at scenario building when I have not allowed the truth about what forgiveness and unforgiveness is. And so again, you mentioned it, we have to free ourselves from bad definition. So if you put in a nutshell, like the true definition to compare it against whatever bad decisions we may have in order to put our faith forward, because we're starting at the wrong place. Yep, absolutely. And so here's maybe something that's especially helpful is every single one of us has at least partially a bad definition of forgiveness. Because all of us were taught to forgive. Maybe I shouldn't say all of us, but mathematically it's pretty close. It's probably 90, 95% of us were taught poorly about forgiveness as children because the majority of people had an experience much like this when you were a child, either at school or at home with a sibling or on a playground or wherever you happen to be, where there was some sort of altercation, there was some sort of hurt feeling. Somebody brought two of you together forcefully or not and said, you say you're sorry. And mean it. And mean it, right? Coached you through whatever you were supposed to say. And so you said the words and the other person said, now tell them that you forgive them. And that was how you learned forgiveness at a formative age. And so however much we may have learned, there's pieces of that that's still in there that on some level, what forgiveness really must mean is that I'm just supposed to forgive and forget. I'm just supposed to let things go. I'm just supposed to pretend like it didn't hurt because frankly, that's what happened when you were a kid was you were hurt and nobody addressed the hurt. They just ran through whatever this adult ritual was that's supposed to make people feel better. And the kid version of you was like, still hurt down here. Yes, we're gonna define it properly in a second. But as you're saying, there were three very quick bad definitions. I know I hear a lot. I know that the one, forgive and forget, that forgiveness means you have to forget it. Two, that forgiveness means you don't set boundaries for the future. Like you just let them do whatever. Or forgiveness means you're saying what that person did to you was okay. Neither one of those three are biblical definition of forgiveness. And those are probably the three that I encounter most as I've gone through my own personal life. But now as I reach with other people walking into that, either caught or taught in some ways around it. But that's not forgiveness. Those are really bad definitions. Forgiveness is turning it over to Jesus, right? Right. And that almost feels too trite to be helpful. That almost feels as bad as we'll just say you're sorry. Okay, well now say I forgive you, right? It almost feels that transactional as well. We'll just, we'll give it to Jesus. And so one of the things that we have to talk about is what it means to forgive from the heart, which is how Jesus talks about forgiveness. He talks about forgiving from your heart. And that's a fundamentally different approach than forgive from your head, forgive from your words, forgive because somebody told you to, right? Forgiving from your heart is a fundamentally different act in part because it's entirely between you and Jesus. Right. And so here's some of the things that I don't like about this. Just truthfully, I don't like it. It feels like it should be another way. If God ever lets me do that Jim Carrey, Bruce Almighty thing, this is probably one of those things that I would opt to change and then recognize the consequences later. But one of the reasons why Peter's able to say what he says about not repaying evil for evil, and one of the things that allows Jesus to say what he says about forgiveness and forgiving from the heart is that I don't even wanna say it. Nothing is impossible to forgive because I've talked with enough people and I've lived enough life on my own to know the response that often comes up to pain which is you don't know what I went through. You don't know what was done to me and if I told you, you would agree with me that that should not, cannot and will not be forgiven. What if I framed it this way? With God, nothing is impossible to forgive. On ourselves, there's probably a long list of things that are impossible to give. Is that the difference ultimately that we're talking about here? It is but I think it's also that whole, it's grace for yourself but not grace for others. Like I want the speed trap to catch the guy that blows past me at 90 but I don't want the speed trap to catch me when I'm needing to go fast to get somewhere. I was just going five over the speed limit and they were going 20 over the speed limit. They deserve it and I don't. Right, this ability that we have to turn evil, to turn sin into an objective measure or you know, because this really is worse than this and so when the scriptures talk about forgiveness and when Jesus says in Matthew 12 that, I mean he says verse 31, I tell you every sin and blasphemy can be forgiven. And there's just something in me that probably is very much like what people were experiencing there of, you can't mean that. You can't mean that but he does. So okay, we look at scripture, we hear Jesus saying there's nothing that's impossible to forgive. So we're, for the purpose of this discussion, we're just gonna accept that to be true but just because we accept something intellectually to be true doesn't mean it makes its way down our heart. We've already said that, we all know that. So let's dig in a little bit more than that. I think one of the reasons that we don't accept this idea of anything is able to be forgiven is because often we think about the manner in which forgiveness occurs wrong. So we understand that God is God, he created the world, he made it, he spoke things into existence. God's able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine. I said at the end of sermon, right? But many times the way God goes at it is not I'm just gonna bam, take this away. And I think when we find ourselves in hurt, in pain, one of the reasons that it lingers in a way that it's unhealthy is we misunderstand forgiveness as a process. Yes. It can't be rushed. Now, it's a lie, time heals all wounds. I hate that one, I hate that one. Jesus heals all wounds. But he often uses time in the process of healing all wounds. So without Jesus, you can go on the rest of your life and you won't be healed. It'll make it worse, honestly. But with Jesus, the only way, but many times he takes time and we feel like, I feel like, well, this should be done now. Like what more do I need to learn? Why do I need to revisit this? Why do, and so I think that's one of the things why people come to this conclusion that not everything can be forgiven because we even misunderstand how God works in our lives to bring forgiveness about. What do you think about that? I still just wanna say things like, I don't like it, but that's not helpful. Sure. But it's honest, and I feel like, again, part of what we have to address here is the heart. And if it feels like we're going slowly through this, it's because we are, because this is a slow process. This is not when you were five and somebody made you forgive and then left you on your own to deal with it. And so very truthfully, when I was in my 20s, I went through one of the most excruciatingly painful events of my life. It was the collapse of a relationship. And it was just, it was heart-rending, just shredding. And if somebody would have walked up to me at that point and said, well, you just need to forgive and you just need to hand that over to Jesus and he'll make you feel better, I probably would have stabbed them with something sharp or maybe something blunt. You've had two revenge issues going on. Thing that happened in the relationship and then the person who said something very insensitive. We're gonna do the work anyway, right? Sure. And so one of the things that we have to come to recognize is that there are times where we have turned to our pain for comfort rather than turning to Jesus because it felt like Jesus wasn't gonna be able to offer what we needed. And again, not an intellectual idea, not a theological idea, but a heart-level reality of in this moment, God can't or won't give me what I need. And this is again, where we come back to this issue of idolatry. And so we have to be willing, and I was listening to a podcast on my drive in today and the guy was talking about these vulnerable places. And he was saying, we have to do the most counterintuitive thing and the most difficult thing, which is when they come up, we have to move towards them. Yeah. We have to step into them rather than running away from them or covering them over again. And he said, the very first thing that you have to do if you want to see real transformation in your life is move toward the place of pain. And in that place of pain, begin to tell God, begin to tell Jesus that you love him and you trust him. So I think it's possible that if you've made it this far in our conversation, that you might hear something like move towards the pain and think, no, obviously, but even more of that, say to yourself, you know what, I'm doing fine and I haven't moved towards the pain. So I just want to kind of address that. If you're okay with fine, there's more. And I'm not being sarcastic with that. I'm just saying that imagine that you thought to yourself that the highest you could reach your arm was halfway up and you've spent the rest of your life accommodating that. And then you discover, no, there's more. I can go to physical therapy. I can have my surgeon work on my rotator cuff, whatever it might be, and I can get full range of motion. What would you want to do? You'd say, I probably want full range of motion, but you're like, it's going to take some work to get there. And so I think there's a lot of us who've lived in a particular way. And when I say us, I do mean me. I'm not like just talking metaphorically. A very, very long time with fine. And convinced ourselves or allow the enemy to convince us that fine is what God wants. Or that fine is the best it's ever going to happen this side of eternity. Or as a mutual friend of ours once probably said to both of us, no, he said to me, that came to the conclusion that I thought I was just gonna have to grip my teeth until I die. Well, in that moment, there's more. And that's really what this invitation is. And so you can stop right now, shut it off and go, I'm good, right? Could be worse. Could be worse. And you're right, it could be. I also could be a whole lot better. And that's the heart. And remember too, that the whole point of, well, not the whole point, but a large part of the point that, you know, of Peter in this letter said, this isn't just about you. Yes. This is about the effect that you have on others. And you gritting your teeth until you die has an effect on others, even as it has an effect on you. And I think there's a whole lot of us are like, who look at other people who have a sense of joy in a moment or a sense of something we don't have. Like, how in the world is that true about you when I know your story? And that is showing the goodness of God to others. And that's what in 1 Peter 3, verse 15 says, always be prepared to give an answer. The implication, as I said on Sunday, is that people are going to ask you. And for people to ask you, that means we have to be living a life of hope. And if we're living a life completely indebted to unforgiveness and trying to repay evil for evil, hope will never exude. Yeah. Yeah, we both had the experience of seeing someone that objectively had it way worse than we did. Yep. And was living differently than we were. And there was something about that that made us different as a result. And that's part of the invitation is, this is for you. You get to live a life that is so unimaginable from where you currently find yourself. And frankly, I can say that regardless of how much time and effort you've spent in this area already. I've spent a fair amount of time in this area over the last decade. And one of the things that God has continued to say is, you're only scratching the surface. And not in a condemning way, not in a you've barely done anything, but in a you don't understand how much more of my kingdom is available to you. And that's the invitation is wherever you find yourself, there's so much more available. That if we hear that from God and our responses, I'm fine. That's gotta mean something. I tell you what it means, I think to me. I'm fine is I'm scared. That's usually what it is. I'm fine is a reflection of the beliefs that I have about my situation that aren't true are greater than the beliefs I have about God. And there's a lot of things that have happened in our life that could begin. So I don't ever wanna diminish anything because I just know the stories of the two people sitting at this round table. I can't imagine all the stories of the people who are listening or watching. They are not easy, they are hard, but there's something powerful about what it looks like to live like an alien when with the help of the Holy Spirit, he's allowing us to forgive properly, turn it over to Jesus over the process of time to let him pay the debt, let him be the judge because he says vengeance is mine. So we can trust that whatever, if there's judgment needed to be meted out, it'll be meted out appropriately by the God of the universe in a fair and good way. Doesn't mean people get off, right? But then we're able to then get back at the proper center to where not this isn't at the idol of our life, but God is, and to hear a little bit better from him when we ask questions like, what do you think God? You know, we've got a long time without saying ask God, but also one of the key things that when we do encounter, little plug for it coming up February 24th and 25th, if you're watching this in the year of our Lord, 2023 in January, right? It's coming in February, 2023, is that one of the big things that keep people from hearing when they ask God, is this thing of forgiveness? It's like the number one thing that often pops up because it has become your idol. And since it's in front of God, it blocks just about anything God wants to say, especially if God may do something or ask you to move towards something that is scary. Yeah, absolutely. And so again, very practically, how do I do this? And this may need to be a longer conversation depending on where you find yourself in your story. And we'd be happy to walk through that with you. That's part of what both of us do here as our job is walk through people's stories with them in these points of pain. So faithforward at cfcyr.org, or you can go to our website, cfcyr.org, and we have a link on the website to request a prayer appointment. And you can make either one of those things happen and it would truly be a privilege. It's one of my favorite parts of my job is to step into people's stories like that and help them experience true freedom. But you also don't have to do this with another person because this is primarily with you and God. And so the very practical thing with forgiveness, it cannot be like it was when you were five. Jesus tells a parable about the unforgiving servant that a king calls before him, a servant takes an account and discovers that man owed him gajillions of dollars, I think was the official translation, and takes an account, determines the value of the debt, and then forgives it. And just so you know, when John's saying gajillions, he's kind of been funny, but that's actually the truth. I mean, so let's put it in words like us, Jeff Bezos type money, comparatively. Yeah, you're not paying it off in this lifetime or multiple lifetimes. And so it is for us that when Jesus calls us to forgive from the heart, one of the things that needs to be done is taking an account of the debt that's owed, taking an account of the effect that that moment, that event, that person had on you, that you don't just wash it away and go, well, I forgive, you know, whomever, I forgive my brother, my mother, my father, my sister, my uncle, my pastor, my neighbor, my teacher, my coach. Yeah, I forgive them, it's at the foot of the cross, it's under the blood of Jesus. Because frankly, it means I don't wanna look at it. So one of the questions that I often ask and I'll ask you is that when I hear that from people, I try to find a gracious way to ask this question. It's two words, it's not a big one, but it matters. For what? I forgive them, for what? For hurting me. How did they hurt you? That's where you're talking about an account because we do have this tendency, with especially in hurt and pain, to live in a level of denial, not because we don't want it solved or we don't want it resolved by God, it's just scary to go there. It is, and that's what that guy on that podcast that I referenced earlier was talking about going towards the pain. Forgive them, for what? For hurting me. How? You have to take an account. The king didn't bring that guy in and say, whatever the debt is, I don't care, it's gone. Because that means it could have been $5 or it could have been Jeff Bezos money. And it didn't matter. The debt matters. The debt matters. And that's usually where we've stopped, is the debt matters so much that I've held on to it because who's gonna let somebody off the hook for gajillions of dollars? But here's the second piece, and this is where forgiveness is between us and God first, and this is where we begin to find true freedom, is that there was a man named Jesus who was put on a cross to pay the price for every sin, to pay every debt. And that Jesus was killed and then came back to life and is still living, and that living, crucified Jesus comes to us and says, that debt is absolutely owed to you. It should not have happened, and that debt has to be paid. It cannot just be ignored. Will you let me pay it? Will you let me pay it instead of them? And that's where we have a choice. We can either accept his invitation and allow him to pay what can never be paid by any other human being on the planet, including you and including me, or the only other option at that point is to say, no, Jesus, your death wasn't enough to pay this. You can say that. It's tough to know where to go from there, but you can say that because forgiveness is a process. And so as we kind of make a shift, I think, to one other thing, because again, there's this next aspect where Peter was talking about, and Jesus talked about it. Jesus said, bless those who curse you. Pray for those who have persecuted you. Again, it's this moment of going from, well, I'm not reactive, both maybe in my head, in my life, I didn't kill you, and guess what? Now I've actually forgiven you. I'm not reactive emotionally or physically. Hold on a second. Now you're asking me to be proactive, right? And that's sort of next level. So I think there's a couple of things. I love these notes that you made, John. I always appreciate getting into your head this way and how you reframe, no, really I do, and how you reframe some of the things that I put on my notes this way is that this idea that it is okay to pray for blessing to people, but it's also equally okay to pray that they have an understanding of the impact that they've had, not so that they're gonna feel horrible and now come back and tell me all the things they're wrong, right? What would it look like to say, God, I'm praying that you ultimately change their life because they need to know for their benefit, not they need to know so they could come back and tell me I'm sorry. Because I could pray, God, show John how he has hurt me. And I can mean two reasons by that. One, so I get what I think I'm owed, that if John sees it, then he's gonna come talk to me. Or the truth is, that's not what the prayer is about. That's not what a prayer blessing is, is that they know truth and that truth sets them free. I mean, that's what you do. You'll know the truth and the truth will set them free. So when we pray then, I love this sort of thing, that also means we include ourself in our prayer. Oh yeah. And what does that mean? Well, again, it means for the other person, if I need them to come begging and sobbing and groveling on the floor, that's still me insisting they pay their own debt. Yep. And that shows me there's more forgiveness that I need to work on with Jesus. And so this really looks more like, if they never come back to me, if they never say another word to me again, I still want God to transform their heart in a way that shows them the effect they're having on themselves and others. This doesn't need to be about me, this is about them. I want their life to be better. And so it is with me. I need you, God, to show me the places where frankly I'm blind, where I don't recognize the effect that I'm having on others. Yeah. Because you're having an effect, so am I. And thank God in his mercy that he doesn't show me all at once. Because it's not good, but just yesterday I felt like he showed me another piece of how I used to be. Yeah. It was hard. I didn't like it. I didn't like it a lot. But it was necessary for me to have a deeper sense of repentance, of thinking differently about what's true and what's not about me and others and God. Yeah. So then it gets us finally to this place of, there's times where we need to better understand the context of the situation. There's times where context matters when it comes to forgiveness. Yep. Not because it makes you go, oh, okay, well then it didn't hurt. Yeah, it's not an excuse. Right. And there's a difference. Like someone talked about, there are reasons and there are excuses. Yep. Right? So we don't have excuses, but we all exist in environments and contexts that say, ah, that's why it seems more likely that this person did or did not or whatever lean into that idea. If someone's really harsh for their words, for example, and like, by the way, I can be, I can be. I didn't, here's a good example. I didn't realize, and John, I've told you this story before, until I met my wife, how harsh I was. Because I grew up in a family that by definition, if you asked how I looked in this, they would tell you. They'd be like, well, why did you ask? Yeah. Right? And so, how do I look in this? And well, pretty bad, right? They didn't think it harsh. Then I engaged my wife and I realized I'm kind of harsh. And that's just a small example. Right. That doesn't give me an excuse for being harsh, but it does highlight where I was blind to that. And what do I need to grow at? There are reasons and contexts, which again, are not excuses, but I do think my heart grows in compassion when God is gracious enough to give me context. Now, sometimes he's not. Yeah. Because he says, okay, more than you need context, will you trust me? Right. Which is another issue probably for another podcast. Yeah. Yeah. You don't always get the whole story and you don't always get the other person's story. Sometimes forgiveness is really just you and God and it's truly an act of trust and faith. Yep. And we mentioned a few times at the beginning, and we'll wrap up with this, that part of what allows us to do all of this, what's frankly incredibly difficult work of surrendering my right for justice, my right to have the debts that are owed me repaid to the penny, is some fundamental truths of scripture that God reveals about what's coming. And so what allows both Peter in this letter and Paul in multiple other letters to call people to this way of living? It's things like this. Nothing, truly nothing of value can ever be taken from you that God cannot restore. The unbelievable audacity of the early church to persecution is, what's the worst you're gonna do? You can't kill me because I'm gonna live forever. There's nothing you can take from me physically that God can't restore, and not only restore, but restore a hundredfold. You look at the number of times that Jesus promises that anyone who suffers for me or leaves, father or mother or home or whatever, I'll restore a hundredfold and give eternal life. It's things like that. And again, sometimes that feels a little too churchy, a little too, we'll just say you're sorry. Okay, now say you forgive him. Okay, it's all coming someday. I don't care about someday, I care about now until I'm 120 or however many years that I have. One of the most helpful things that we may be able to ask God to do now is to help us better understand how he sees reality now in the context of his kingdom and in the context of eternity. And that's hard. That is as hard as any of this other stuff that we're talking about, because it feels distant, requires a level of trust and a level of faith and a level of surrender to a fundamentally counterintuitive way to live. And yet that's the call. When we look at this, Matthew chapter 16, it says, no one's ever given up his life that hasn't gained more. And I don't know how old you are listening to this, but no matter how old you are in comparison to eternity, it doesn't diminish the pain, it doesn't diminish the hurt, it doesn't diminish the suffering, the call to suffering, which is an alien call, right? Right here in this life. But it just doesn't compare. Jesus said, whoever loses life will gain it. That's so hard. Paul said it this way, for me to live is Christ, to die is gain. There's so many just over and over and over again. And I think it's something that we really have to embrace, not just at a head level, at a heart level. If we're really gonna understand this call, don't repay evil for evil, what does it mean to be prepared in your hearts to answer as a hopeful person, because people have seen your hope in the midst of suffering and difficulty. And so as always, as we end, if there's something that we said that just landed wrong, that has you thinking, I can't believe they said that, I'm never gonna listen to this again. That's okay. But shoot us an email, give us a phone call, come and talk. If we've explained something poorly, we'd love the chance to explain it better. But if we've explained something correctly that just is really difficult to process and implement, again, we would love the privilege of walking through that with you. We have been helped immensely by others, and it would absolutely be a pleasure to return the favor. So please engage. Engage in this with God, engage in this with others, engage in this with us to the extent that you're willing, because it would be an honor. But for now, we're gonna call this good. We'll pick up next week in week 12 slash five of Easily in Living. And we'll continue a little bit more with this call to living wholly. But for now, on behalf of Brian, I'm John, and we'll see you next time.
