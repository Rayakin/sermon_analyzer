Welcome back to the Faith Forward Podcast, John Ackerman joined today by Pastor Lee Towns. Good to be here. Thanks for coming to hang out, Lee. I love hanging out. Always fun to have you here. So we are wrapping up the third week in the first half of a six week series. The first portion of which is entitled being giveaway people. And if you didn't follow the language of that, it's okay. I'm not sure I did either, but I know that that's how the calendar set up. And so we're just going to roll with it. So in just a minute, as we always do, we're going to talk to Lee and Lee, you're going to tell us about what you probably talked about on Sunday, since we're recording this on Thursday. But before we do that, just a quick reminder. If you've been tracking with us for any time at all, this is episode 97. We've been approaching our hundredth episode, which assuming everything continues on schedule will be on February 11th, Superbowl Sunday. And for that episode, what we've been asking is for you to send us a short video clip, two, three minutes, a short audio clip. If you don't want your face to appear on the visual portion of the podcast, or if you don't want to hear yourself at all. And I totally get that as the person who edits this podcast, just send us an email and one of us will read it. But we want to hear the stories of what God's doing in your life. Not just because of this platform, not just because of this podcast. It's not even really about the podcast, but it's about a group of people that seem to be drawn towards the topic of how do I take my faith forward week in and week out. And that's what we want to celebrate on our hundredth episode is the stories of what God is doing in people who want to take their faith forward. So in whatever form or fashion you would care to submit those stories, please do so. It could be a story of a moment. It could be a story of the last year, whatever you can conveniently fit in three minutes. And I love you all, but if you can't fit it in three minutes, I'm going to have to pick which part of your story we can share in three minutes. So if you can get all of that in ideally by February 4th, that would be fantastic. If you can't get it in until February 7th, that's great. If it's any later than that, I can't promise it makes the cut because I won't necessarily be able to do it all last minute. So with all of that said, welcome and thank you all for being here. As we've talked through this series about being giveaway people. And so Lee, as you're wrapping up this three week portion of it, tell us a little bit about what you're going to tell us. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I am the last of the first half. How's that? Is that, that's concise. Yeah. I'm the last week of the first half. And then, uh, you're going to be somewhere in the second half. February 11th. Good for you. Good for you. Well, it's a big day. It's a big, big day. You are the guy and the hundreds episode. And I got to speak the day before at something too. So it's going to be a busy weekend. Well, as far as this weekend, the last of the first half, we are wrapping up that cycle of being giveaway people. Brian, in the first couple of weeks, as you know, having done the podcast and listened to the message, talked about who is worthy, that everyone was worthy of being treated as a neighbor. And then that our treatment of one another's neighbor, loving others and giving ourself away to others is not an agenda based thing based on how they give it back to us. But it's actually the way we love God. In fact, that's the way Jesus answers the question intended to trip him up. But how he answers the question, uh, by the young ruler that asked what of all of the commands are the most important. And he says, well, first is one, you know, because the young ruler had been reciting it in, uh, the course of his Jewish life from really the age of, uh, that he was first able to articulate things because they taught it to their kids from a very early age. The, the Hebrew Shema that just goes hero is, or your Lord, your you, the Lord, your God is one God. And you're to love the Lord, your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength. But then what Jesus does is he adds to that. And he says, here's the second, uh, of the two great commandments. And it's that you're to love your neighbor as yourself. And then says, when you get that right, all of the law and prophets, they hang on those two commandments. And what Jesus does in that is says, um, you know, you love God fully. And as you love God, it will lead you to love others. And the way you love others is your worship to God. So that's where we've been. Now we take another step and it talks about us personally. That's the, that's where I was. And what's, uh, what's the role or where I will be in a few days when I get to preach, uh, what's the role for me personally in this process of loving others, giving myself away to others in worship to God. And when you start to talk about that, you begin to think about gifts, you know, and, and, uh, that's a very familiar phrase around the church is very familiar phrase. This time of year, we've just come out of Christmas. And so gifts have been a part of the narrative for a few weeks and is a part of the culture that is true Christian faith and that we have a gift. And so it was, I was thinking about this text in first Corinthians 12, that speaks of the gifts. And it's one of several texts throughout the Bible that speaks about gifts. Paul talks about it in Ephesians four and in Romans 12, shows up in some of the other apostolic writings. And, uh, the, the new Testament talks regularly about the nature of gifts, but this particular passage, uh, is where we landed or will land on this weekend and, and thought about the gifts and how they are, uh, applied and how they are demonstrated. And there are a handful of things that showed up. And I started thinking about my mom of all things. Um, and my mom had, uh, probably like your mom, probably like your grandma. My mom had, uh, a few little phrases that I would call mantras, right? That she just said, and now it just rattles around in my head. One of them when I was growing up was, um, I don't care if you like it, you need to look like you like it. That was her phrase. And she said that all the time. I've said it to my kids, you know, so it was like, it was kind of like a mantra. And as I was working my way through this text, I realized there was a mantra emerging that is good and helpful for me, you know, that, that, uh, that we all need to apply. And it's really, you know, we're going to work our way through it when, you know, when I do the message on Sunday or have done the message, because you've watched, you're watching post message, but the mantra just works like this. I've been given a gift by God that I need to give to you for kingdom good. That that simple phrase is really kind of how Paul lays out the gifts in this passage that, that we've all been given a gift and God gives the gift and God makes the choice about what the gift is and when the gift appears and who gets the gift. God gives us this gift, but he doesn't give us this gift for our own benefit. He gives us this gift to give away to others. In fact, the way, uh, the translation that I'm using says it so that we can help each other, that that's why we have the gift. And so it's, it's for the kingdom good. It's so that others will glorify God and advance the work of God. And we give that gift for that purpose to bring glory to God and advance the work of God. And so we talk our way through that. Look at the nuances of that in the context of, you know, about six or eight verses there in first Corinthians 12. And we can talk further about that, but that's the, that's the message in a quick summary. There's a lot more underneath the hood. You haven't listened to the message. You might want to go do that. And as always, you know, we offer the summary because we recognize that people access the podcast, not always on the Sunday where the message is preached. They're not necessarily leaving church and going home and queuing this up first thing. And so sometimes it's days, weeks, months later. And so, but again, this is always meant to be paired with the heart of the message itself before we then get to the application of, right, how do I go do it? So as we now shift our attention to the, all right, how do I go do it? One of the very first things that I found is helpful because you and I were talking just before we hit record, like this is a passion topic for both of us, right? Gifting and how we live out gifting. And, and I've found that as I've gotten to have conversations with people, one of the most helpful things to do is define terms. And so we're not going to do that exhaustively. We're not going to Merriam-Webster this per se, but it is important. I've come to realize, and I think you have too, that it's important to differentiate what we mean by gifts as opposed to skills and talents. Yeah. So is there a quick way that you help people differentiate with that? Yeah. Yeah. And, and actually this passage leads to this conclusion. So let me do a little bit of a kind of word study here. So I referenced the fact that the New Testament has at least three, actually has more than that, but three primary passages that list gifts. And there's a tendency on our part to go, oh, okay, so here's the list. And if we combine them all together, these are the things that are the list. But the fact that they live in the list are different, tells us that there's not a comprehensive list of gifts. And when we talk about gifts, we were talking about this earlier. When we talk about gifts, we have this tendency to have compartments, gifts, abilities, skills, talents, and, you know, and some of those things are genetic. Some of those things are learned. Some of those things are a part of maturation, you know, that kind of thing. And then we have this compartment over here. Sometimes that we think about that is some special dispensation that God, you know, gives us this gift that has some mystery around it that, but when in fact, if you look at the passage, there's nine gifts listed in 1 Corinthians 12. And of those nine gifts, Paul kind of has a, if you look at it and again, without getting all nerdy and the, you know, the word study of it, Paul kind of clusters them in categories. And he follows a rhythm that's kind of common in first century writers. It's the ABA rhythm. So first group, then second group, and then you come back to the first group. And the, and the, so really there's two categories in there. It's serving and saying, so it's words and deeds in that. But, but the fact that there's nine there, and then there's, you know, X number in the other passages points to the reality that what actually is true is if you go to those other compartments that we have talents, abilities, and skills, any one of those things could be a gift. And the distinction of a gift is this, that a gift is for the benefit of people in discovering God. It reveals God and it advances the work of God. And the gift is a gift, I mean, a ability, a talent, a skill that someone says, this is who I am, but God, now it's yours. And the distinction of the gift is the spirit. So if you look through this text, and I love how Paul does it, but he says there are different kinds of gifts, but the same spirit. And as he starts working through the list, he'll say to one person, he gives like for special knowledge and the same, and to another, he gives the ability to give wise advice, but the same spirit gives it. And then the spirit gives the ability to speak in tongues. And to another, he gives the ability to interpret tongues, but it's the same spirit. And I'm really spitting on you there, but it's the same spirit. I don't know if that plays on the camera, but there was a, there was a lot of spray coming out of that moment. But, but, but he says repeatedly, it's the same spirit that does it. It's the same spirit. It's the same spirit. And, and what is being pointed out there, what's obvious there is what makes this ability, this talent, the skill, this offering to God distinct is the Holy Spirit. And there's a whole lot that I would love to dig in. And, you know, we would fill up multiple podcasts if I, you know, really started digging into the nature of the spirit. But, but, but really, if you go back and you think about, okay, so what role does the spirit play in our life? And we like to say it like this at CSE, we are spirit directed, but to be spirit directed means we, this is my part, have to be spirit surrendered. Okay. So here, I'm going to give you control, Holy Spirit, and you can lead. And when that happens, so here's the simple, long process to get to the simple definition of a gift. When that happens, then the Holy Spirit starts to say, use how I made you for the glorification of God and the work of his kingdom. And the spirit having control over that function makes that a spiritual gift. So they're a long way around to a very short answer, but there's a lot to say about that, obviously. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. As I've had conversations with people, the things that, that seem to help me and help them understand is that you can think of talents as the things that you were just, that were inborn in you, a predisposition, right? A natural competency, but all natural competencies still have to be honed. Right. They still have to be developed. And that's where we look at skills is that skills are things that are cultivated, they're crafted, they're honed, they're sharpened. And some skills can be picked up with prolonged practice and effort that maybe you're not predisposed to, but you develop a competency for. But like you said, all of those things can become gifts. Right. But the thing for me that separates a gift is it's not what I'm doing. It's how I'm doing it. Right. It's, it's what's informing it, what's empowering it. And then especially what's the focus. Cause like you were talking about with these gifts, they all require an outlet. Yeah. They all require not just an audience in the sense of passive observers, but they require a beneficiary. Yeah. They have to be done to someone else or done for someone else. They can never just be used personally. Right. And so when we talk about gifting over the course of the rest of this episode, that's really what we're, what we're focusing on is it's not just what we're doing, but it's how we're doing it, what's empowering it. And then we're focusing on the beneficiaries of not just their personal benefit, but the benefit being the coming of the kingdom, the glorification of God, and that it's life giving both to them and to ourselves, which is another cool part about gifting we'll get to. Right. Yeah. One of the, so we, when we talk about gifts, one of the labels often we use when we, when we kind of use the long label for gifts is gifts of the spirit. Yeah. And so when the new Testament talks about gift, when Paul talks about gifts, he uses a word charisma and charisma, you know, is a familiar words, common language word now. And, and we have a whole lot of thoughts and derivatives or words that are built off of that. But one of the things that is true about charisma, and if you talk about a person who has charisma or a charismatic person, you're talking about a spiritual thing that, that they've got life, they've got energy. And in new Testament terms or biblical terms, when you see the word charisma, it's spirit filled. So what happens is Paul says, here are these abilities, skills, talents, and sometimes special dispensations that God takes because the spirit has taken control over it and the spirit gives it life. It gives it charisma and that's the gift. And so it's, it's important for us to acknowledge that sometimes our spiritual gifts are when we surrender our, you know, our genetic predispositions. Sometimes our spiritual gifts are when we surrender our developed skills. And sometimes our spiritual gifts are when God gives us a special, for lack of a better way to say it, dispensation, a special expression that we maybe didn't have previously. And there's some gifts. When you start looking at the list of gifts that are listed that you go, Oh, you didn't learn that. And you didn't have a genetic predisposition to that. That's God doing something that's unique and only God can do in you. So, so it's a, all of those kinds of, uh, resource pools can be used to discover or to express a gift God chooses. That's, and that's the really important part of this is that, that gifts are given by God. They're empowered by God. It's not something we generate. Right. It's what God does. This is a work of the Holy spirit in us. And I think that's one of the things that makes us so challenging for people. And I promise we're going to get into some of the practical, but it really does help to define the terms or at least maybe a better way to say it as define expectations. Because I know that there's plenty of people that feel like, well, my gifts must be the things that I'm good at. And sometimes yes. Yeah. And sometimes no. Yeah. And there are plenty of times that, you know, I have to whatever extent, a natural talent and inborn ability that just made some things come out more effortlessly than others to teach. Yeah. But then I also went and cultivated the skill of teaching. I learned the craft of it. I learned the science of it. And I can tell you, there are plenty of times where I will operate in the skill of teaching than in the gift. Yeah. Yeah. Teaching that I will operate out of what I know to do correctly rather than out of the spiritual empowerment of God. Here is the gift you've given me of teaching. You use it rather than no, no, no, God, I got it. I know how to teach. You just sit back. Yeah. Right. Again, it's not what we do. It's how we do it. And there was something that popped up about an hour ago that I read from a pastor out on the West coast. And he said, your gifting is not always your calling, which is another place that I think sometimes we get turned around on. This must lead to either gainful employment or occupation or job description at some point. But he said, your gifting is not always your calling. God does not need your skill. He's looking for a yield at heart and will lead you as you trust in him. Don't let your confidence be in what you're good at, but in the Lord and his ability, your dependence on him is what sets you up for greatness in him. And the short version of what he had said was most of us define our ministries by what we're good at instead of what we're called to do. And I thought that was just such a great way of encapsulating this idea of your giftings are the place where God's connection and power can most naturally flow through you into the world and the people around you. And sometimes like Paul pointed out, it comes through my weaknesses. It comes to the places I don't think I've got it. And that's the whole point. Yeah. Yeah. I love that because the distinction of a gift is not what you're good at. It's what God chooses to use about you. And that, you know, there's a freedom in that, that God's going to, you know, when I say I, like I, I was at a conference, it's been a couple of decades ago, it was back when promise keepers was filling stadiums. And there was a speaker that said, you know, I find that, um, whenever I go to God, I have this tendency to go, Hey, God, here's this. And I offer my life in a pile. And he said, what God has been teaching me is that what I do with that pile is I hide some stuff in the middle of it, hoping that God's not going to see it. And God goes, I don't want the whole pile. I want that. And, and that's what God does with our gifts. There are a lot of things we're good at, but there are some of those things that God goes, that one right there, that thing, you may not be good at it because that's not the criteria that God chooses. He's going to say this thing about you. I want you to use that to bring glory to me and advance the work of my kingdom. And that is how a gift is manifest. That's the whole point with Jesus, right? We know who you are. You're the carpenter's son. There's no way you're this good. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. That's the point, right? So the two things we're going to cover in depth now that we have hopefully not belabored, but helpfully articulated the significance of the words that we're talking about. Very simply, how do I discover my gift or giftings and continue to do so over the course of my life? And then how do I deploy my gift or giftings and continue to do so over the course of my life? So it's time for my favorite part of the show. How do I discover my gifting? Ask God. See you all next time. No, but in all seriousness, right? Again, we go back to the necessity of defining the term because so often I have and many others have looked for my gifting in places of competency, right? If I'm comfortable here, that must be my gifting. And like we just talked about, your comfort is not actually the point when it comes to gifting. And so how do I discover? Don't necessarily go looking for places of comfort. Don't necessarily go looking for places of competency. There is value in, for example, asking the people around you, hey, what are some things I'm good at is a decent starting question. But again, the goal is not competency. The goal is not accomplishment. And so maybe a better question is asking other people, what about me seems to have an effect on others? Because again, that's what we're looking for. It's not what you do. It's how you do it. What are the things about me that seem to bring me alive or bring other people alive or make people go, wow, I don't understand how you do that. Right. You know, Henry Blackaby in experiencing God and those of us that did that journey some years ago probably resonated around this one thing more than any other part of that discipleship journey. And it was this, that, you know, the art of discipleship, the art of following Jesus is to find where God is working and join him there rather than asking God to come bless my stuff. Go find where God is working. And in a very similar fashion, the discovery of my spiritual gifts is really about God. Where am I sensing that you're working that like, where am I, where am I seeing kingdom effectiveness? Because I, I can't overstate this. The, the spiritual gift is not given so that I feel good so that I'm somehow affirmed. I gain some kind of status or power or influence. The spiritual gift is given to advance and build the kingdom of God. And by definition, advancing and building the kingdom of God is expanding the places where God rules. That's a, that's a very simple understanding of that. So, so as I am giving myself away to other people, where is it that God is using me or wants to use me so that the kingdom of God is expanded into other people. And so to that point that you were saying about the question, is this more a question of God, where are you working in me? And where are you working through me? Where, where in me are you showing yourself and expanding your reign and rule in the heart and lives of other people? Because the gifts are given for that purpose. And, and I think, you know, we should say there are tools out there that are helpful in the process, but not the end game. Like, like it can start to open the door to discovery. So taking spiritual inventories, and some of them are simple and some of them are complex, but taking gift inventories, that's a great way to begin the journey. But, but if you, you know, like I, I know of some places that look at those inventories and those are hard and fast. Yep. It says you've got it. Exactly. And like they'll write job descriptions and say, you have to have gift one, gift two, gift three. And if you don't test, they won't even interview you, you know? So that's not a good use of that. That's not a good use at all of those, but it is a great introduction, but there are some better next steps to, to finish the work of discovery. Yeah. I found they're really helpful too in eliminating our own blind spots. Yeah. Because some people have a really hard time recognizing that I have this gift. Right. There's a, there's a classic book in the field of education, Robert Fulgham's, Everything I Ever Needed to Know I Learned in Kindergarten. Yeah. And he talks about how you walk in any kindergarten class and you ask who can sing and every hand goes up, who can dance, all the hands, who can draw all like you name it. They all think they can do it all. And there's something pure and right about that level of confidence in the willingness to do the thing, not the competence to do the thing. And that's part of what we're getting at here with this idea of gifting. It's the willingness to do the thing, not the competence. But he goes on to say in the book, you walk into any high school classroom and not just because high schoolers are jaded, but because all of us follow this track of, you walk into a 10th grade or 12th grade class and you say, how many of you can sing? And the stipulations start coming. First of all, you might get six hands instead of the whole room. And then all of them are going to say, I can, but I can only do this. And that's what most, if not all of us start to do at some point, not with skills or talents, but with giftings, the things that some part of us recognizes has been placed in us, but we don't know what to do about it because it lacks the feeling of competence and confidence that a skill or a talent does. And I found that these third-party assessments are sometimes really helpful in getting past those blinders and helping me see, wait a minute, how'd that get here? This says, this says I can sing. Now I have to wrestle with this. Yeah. Well, and, and it's not just like, it's not just talent stuff. I can't tell you, I mean, and you know this, cause we've, we've had this conversation in days past where like, for example, the gift of leadership, people can be, go, I'm not a leader. And the test says, yeah, you're a leader. And then you start saying, well, maybe I am a leader. And you start asking questions and you start asking the community around them and you start, they start listening to what God's saying. And all of a sudden they go, oh, I guess I, yeah, I guess I am doing this. I, and I had that experience with, I was having dinner with somebody a couple months ago and, and they were talking about their ministry and the things that they loved and, and, you know, how their ministry gave them life. And I looked at him and I said, so tell me, you know, what do you think are your spiritual gifts? And they started listening. And I said, okay, but you've told me how you take care of people, you provide food for people, you nurture people when, you know, they're in distress and, and you don't mention the gift of shepherding. And they looked at me and went, well, I never thought about that. And I said, you have the gift of shepherding. So here, let me validate that for you, which is another way we discover that is in the context of community. Yeah. Yeah. I, one of the things that I've found has been a really helpful descriptor for me is that we have a tendency to put giftings in particular into a box. And that box has a really lovely label on the outside, much like you do when you're packing up your house to move, right? This is where this thing goes. It goes in the kitchen or it goes in bedroom number two or whatever that the gift of shepherding goes in this box. And this is where this box goes, the gift of leadership goes in this box. And this is what this box looks like the gift of teaching, right? Or the gift of singing or the gift of singing, right? That unless you can dot, dot, dot, you don't really have the gift. Right. And so one of the parts about how do I discover my gifting? And this is practical tip. I don't know which one we're on for this talk. It might be the first, it might be the seventh. We'll leave that up to you is at some point, this is where the asking God becomes really, really helpful is you have to invite God to break open the box that your giftings have been placed in, that they've been defined by it has to look like this, or it has to sound like this, or it has to whatever. Yeah. And, and doing that, John, I think about this and you've said a couple of things in the course of our conversation today that has taken me back to this thought in my mind. A lot of times we don't see the spiritual gift in us because we don't see it right blind spot or whatever. And we're intimidated by it. And, and when we ask God, God goes on with this and he starts pointing at something specific and it feels, it feels frightening. Yeah. Like it's, Oh, I don't know how to do this. I'm uneasy about this. I, I certainly can't do this, you know, that kind of thing. And, and I want to remind us that this journey is a journey of faith and faith has an element of fear. Yes. It, it, if, if there's not a part of following Jesus that doesn't intimidate you, that doesn't feel bigger than you, that doesn't feel like you're not capable of it, then you're not following Jesus. You're not walking by faith. Yeah. And, and the spiritual gifts are those that we're going to, we're going to lean in and we're going to say, okay, God, show me where you can use me in my unique makeup. Show me where you can be glorified in and through me and where you can build your kingdom through me contributing big or small doesn't matter, but show me where you can do that. And God's going to go here and you're going to go, if you're, you know, breathing, you're going to go, okay, that feels tough. And the, and the dilemma is going to be, can God really have it? Yeah. And, and are you going to say yes and let God do the work in you to use that spiritual gift for the kingdom good and others that it's intended for? So. Yeah. Yep. So along those same lines, there's a couple other traps that we can fall into in this discovery phase. Um, and we're not going to try to be exhaustive with this, but there's, there's two big ones that I find that come up quite often in the discovery portion and it's, I just discovered it. And maybe I got past the box phase where, you know, I fell victim to the, well, I'm a teacher. This is what teaching is supposed to look like. I did that with my gifting. I knew since the eighth grade that I was born to be a teacher, but there was something in me that said, but that has to be in schools with desks and chalkboards or smart boards or whatever we got now. And it wasn't until 2018. I remember the moment it was November of 2018 and I'm sitting on a beach and I suddenly have this epiphany in the midst of a lighthearted conversation where my wife and I are like, what if we sold the plane tickets and stayed here? You know, how would we live to continue to live on the beach? Right. And my thought went, well, I'd have to find a school because that's, that's the thing I know I need to do. I need to teach. And my box said teaching happens in schools. Right. And so my box thinking said, well, if we stayed in paradise, I'm gonna have to find a school and figure out what kind of history they teach. Cause I love teaching history and I'm not going to be happy. I was almost a math teacher. It was this close, but teaching history made me happier. So I'm gonna have to find a history role. And in the span of about 10 more seconds, I had this epiphany looking out at the ocean, seeing a scuba diving boat and had a natural thought flow out of my head of, man, if we stay in paradise, I am learning to scuba dive. And then I'd want to teach. And in that moment, my box of teaching, the box that I put the gifting of teaching in broke. And I suddenly understood in a whole new way, this is who I am. And this is what comes most naturally out of me. And it doesn't matter what it looks like. I gotta get, God just broke my box and I don't need it anymore. It's a good thing when God breaks your box. And so some of us, the practical thing is we need to invite God into some box breaking of what box have I put this gifting in and said, well, this is what it's supposed to look like. Another one is I discover my gifting and then I start looking around and I see other people that are doing it and I fall victim to the trap of, but somebody is already doing it. And I have to tell you one, that is a very natural progression to have to work through because there is something in us that wants to offer something unique and that's good and that's right. And it gets distorted. And in some cases we see that I need to offer something unique as I need to be the only one doing it. And that's not accurate. It's actually a good thing if there's more people doing something good. YouTube is not suffering from an overabundance of the same kinds of videos. In fact, it's part of what makes the platform so rich. Similarly, we look around, we find somebody else who seemingly is doing it better. And so we'll wilt or pull back or no, I can't use my gifting until I have developed it to the level of, by the way, that's a skill that we're developing at that point, not a gifting until it's as good as they are. And we have to be reminded that your unique expression of your gifting will affect some that whoever that is that you think is doing it better either can't or won't. Yeah. And I think that's, you know, Paul starts this passage with actually just the three verses that precede where we jumped in. He is establishing what, you know, who God is and what we're capable of with the Holy Spirit and what we're not capable of. And he establishes the authority of God. And then throughout the course of this run of verses, he's saying, it's God that gives this gift. It's God that gives this gift. It's God that gives this gift. It's God that gives this gift. Here's what we need to understand about God. God is a master designer and he knows every element that goes into accomplishing what he is intending. And so when he looks at you and he says, I need you and I want this part of you, he knows exactly where it fits. He knows exactly how it moves forward. And when we go, oh, there's other people doing it, or I'm not as good as, and we start to qualify our place in God's plan, what unbeknowing to us we're doing, it's God, you don't know what you're doing. You don't know how to allocate resources. You don't know how to strategize for an outcome. And so we're disconnecting from the understanding of God, which is why Paul says, look, it's God who gives this gift and God doesn't do anything that is wasted or that is a mistake. None of those things have happened with God. And so when God says, I want this part of you, he has a very specific place and it is an important role, however it fits, whether it's as good as somebody else or not, it doesn't matter because what God wants is to use you in a very specific way that no one else can do, that no one else can do. Yeah. Yeah. There was a guy I got to talk to who is one of the most inspiring people I've met around this topic of gifting. It just flows naturally out of him. He can't help but talk about it and you can't help but be moved by it. His name's Alan Arnold. He's out in Colorado. And on this particular topic where the trap is comparison, he said, we don't need you to be the next whoever. We already have them. Yeah. We need you to be the first you. Yeah. Yeah. Because we don't have that yet. And that's what's needed. Yeah. Right. And you know, if a imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, right. It's okay to model yourself after others. It's okay to be inspired by others. It's okay to recognize the greatness or the accomplishment or the integrity of others, but we don't need you to be the next them. Right. That's not what's needed. Right. Right. That's not who God made you to be is the next other person. Right. He made you to be you. Right. And he made you uniquely and what they, whoever they are, can do, you can't. Yeah. And what you can do, they can't. Don't miss the second half of that because that's very, very important. You bring something because of your unique makeup, because of you being fearfully and wonderfully made. And there's only one of you, you bring something that no one else can bring. Yeah. And so don't demean that. Yeah. Last thing I'm gonna say on this topic. And then we're going to transition to the second part, because as we usually do, we're like three quarters of the way through the show and we're only halfway through the notes. This is an ongoing process of discovery. Yeah. Right. I am still discovering things that God seemingly placed in me to quote Esther for such a time as this, that this isn't, again, we go back to the original quote, this isn't about your calling. This isn't about your occupation. This isn't about your profession. Yeah. This is about this moment, this season of your life. And I love that I get to have conversations with people that are a decade or two past me that are still discovering because they're willing. They're willing to be used. They're willing to let God move in and through them. They're discovering things in their fifties and in their sixties and in their seventies that have been lying dormant until such a time as this. And just to add to that and kind of fully finish the theological framework around this, God doesn't always give every gift from the beginning. And so you may have in a period of time in your life, had a gift that went in a certain direction and now God has you in a different place and he gives you a brand new gift. And that's a part of that ongoing discovery is that there are seasons for gifts. And there are some gifts that God will land in some people's lives and it'll carry them throughout the course of their entire life. And then there are some that will come and go for moments and opportunities and seasons. And so there is a constant process of God, where are you asking me to surrender something about me so that you can be glorified and your kingdom can be built? Yep, exactly. So second topic, how do we deploy this? At whatever phase of discovery we're in, what do we do now? And there's so many things that I know both of us want to say in this stretch. So we're going to try to do it succinctly, no promises. But first and foremost is, God seems to love live practice as a place of development, which runs so counter to a risk averse 21st century Western mindset of, no, no, no, I don't go do the thing until I'm good at the thing. And in so many cases, God says, no, no, no, it's backwards. The way you get good at the thing is you do the thing and you do it publicly in some cases, or you do it in front of others in some cases, not in the privacy of your bedroom until you're past the embarrassing moments. Yeah. So sometimes God, you know, gives us directives and, you know, there are truths like that that show up in kind of nuanced ways. And sometimes he models it for us and Jesus models this. So if you go back to the gospels and you look at Jesus' interaction with the disciples, there's an encounter with the disciples where Jesus sends us out in pairs and they come back in and go, Hey, we went out and we were doing what we watched you do, and it didn't work. And we got a whole bunch of questions now. And that's an illustration of God loves to teach us in the, the game, like to put us in and now, okay, here's how you're going to learn how to do this by being engaged. Yeah. And here's what I don't like about that. And I know that this is true from my time as a student and a teacher from my time as a player. And my time as a coach is I've learned, and pretty much all of us learn more through failing, not failure. Cause that sounds like an identity statement to some people, but we learn more by doing it wrong than we do through instant success because instant success doesn't always tell us how we did it. And so live practice is essential with that said, I also want to throw in this caveat because I've thought three times now to say it, and I want to make sure I say it. All of this about giftings being empowered by God and not just something that we've cultivated does not excuse us from the necessity to grow in our giftings, right? The difference between the one-off and the place that you're invited to spend considerable time in. Yeah. Right. It would be, it would be absolutely in keeping with God's character for somebody to step up onto a space and speak or sing or whatever the gifting was and do it seemingly with no prior experience or background or training or competency. And it would be fundamentally immature to continue to show up in that space time after time after time and go, well, I don't need to practice. I don't need to learn. I don't need to grow at all in this because, well, God will just do whatever he wants. Right. Right. So little asterisk there. I think it's more than a little asterisk. I think it's a really important thing. I think that, I think we have a responsibility to discover and then we have a responsibility to nourish our gifts. And I think that is demonstrated throughout scripture where we have, once we have discovered where God is placing us, we have a responsibility to mature and develop. And again, let's go to Jesus life. I mean, you want to look at the laboratory, his experience with the disciples is, is a laboratory and, and watch how he grew their abilities and, and then didn't say to them, Hey, you know, you hung out with me for three and a half years. You're all good. You graduate, you're done. And now you're all good, but actually set them on a process of continual growth. I was just sharing with a class that I teach here Wednesday night. One of my missional verses is found in second Corinthians chapter three, verse 18. And I won't go into all the background of it, but what it basically says, or not basically what it says, what it does say and how it drives me in ministry is that every day with increasing likeness, we are being transformed into the likeness of Jesus. So we are growing every day and, and I'm going to go a step maybe in a further direction. I think apart from our conversion, not only do I think this, I think the text teaches this, that apart from our conversion and the transformation that occurs as a result of our conversion, the most important thing that happens in our spiritual journey is discovering and deploying our spiritual gifts, which means that I need to be in constant pursuit of that gift and the development of that gift and the nourishing and nurturing of that gift. And we need to work. So it's a big asterisk. We need to keep growing that. Yeah. And so often we have a tendency to try to cut the cord and be like, all right, God, we had a good moment. Right. I'm now going to go train really, really hard. I'm going to read a bunch of books and listen to some podcasts and I'm now going to cultivate absent of the connection. Right. And that's never the invitation either. Right. The disciples go out and they come back. They go out and they come back. And even in the going out, it's still through the empowerment of God that those things are working in the first place. So we can never get that one sideways. The other thing that always comes up when I think about how do we deploy, how do we practice, you know, what's the live fire look like for this? It's the parable of the faithful stewards that Jesus tells in Matthew 25, where he talks about, you know, these three servants, they have a master who's going away. The master gives each of them some resources with which to accomplish the vision of the master and to two of them very successfully take the resources and multiply them. And the third one being fairly convinced that the only thing that he's going to suffer is punishment because it's just not going to be good enough, decides to do nothing with the resources he's been given. Right. So the master comes back and the two that were faithful, he not only congratulates, but he rewards with like a leveling up of their gifting and the opportunity to use it. Right. And so there's some things that resonate in me as we think about how do I go and deploy this? As I look at those two faithful servants, the one is they go and deploy their gifting with an understanding of, with a knowledge of the heart and the intentions of the one who gave them the resources. They're doing it, not just in his name, but in his way because they have come to know him. They're doing it like they know he would, not just the way he would want them to, but the way that he would. And so coming back to my guy, Alan Arnold, he said, our gifting isn't primarily to do things for God, hoping to earn God's favor. That's conditional creation. Our gifting is an invitation for us to pursue what we love with God. That's relational creation. And that really is the heart of what we're after here. This isn't, I gave you a gift, now go earn me some money with it. Right. Go earn some people for me. Right. Right. It's, I'm giving you this because I want you to discover me in this. I want you to discover who I made you to be in this. I want you to experience my kingdom, which as Jesus said, is all around you right now. Right. And this is going to help you see it, which is why it's possibly the most important thing to cultivate. Right. It's the way you see the kingdom and God and yourself and others. It's the way you live out this commandment that we've been teaching on for these last couple of weeks. Right. Right. And they're willing to engage in the risk because he gives them these resources and they talk about investing. And we all know investing is risky, right? It's not guaranteed return. And, but they're willing to put themselves and these resources and the trust of their master into a place of unknown, into a place of discomfort. Right. Right. It's not that we go into greater measures of certainty of outcome. It's we go into greater measures of certainty of who we're doing this with. Right. And trust him with the outcome. And again, I come back to my guy, Alan, because I love this one. When unsure what choice to make, consider which has the potential to draw you closer to God, not which is most familiar or comfortable, which is so often what we do with our gifts. I know how to do this. I'm going to go do that. Exactly. He said, the best path is rarely the one we can master on our own. God's invitations initiate us by inviting us into the seemingly impossible with him. That's where your gifting is designed to take you. Yeah. It's designed to take you closer to God and closer to the way that God does things, which is not the way we do. Right. And to teach us to live by his power and understanding. Right. Not our own, which is fundamentally uncomfortable. Right. It's supposed to be. And, and which means that that whole starting point of this is surrender. Yeah. Is the critical foundation. Right. So here it's yours, God. And whatever happens from here, it's yours, God. Yeah. And what I get to do is say, God, you can pick out the thing about me that you want to use. And I get to play a part in your estate, in your kingdom. And, and that one takes pressure off of me. I don't have to worry about how good I am. And I don't have to worry about what the, what the outcome are. Yeah. Because it's his, he's, this is what I've surrendered to him. And now what I've surrendered to him, he's saying now in turn, give that away to the people around you and let me take care of how the kingdom expands. Yeah. And the last thing that I really appreciate about this parable of the faithful servants is they start small. And that's exactly what the master, what Jesus telling the parable comments on is they were faithful with a little. And I think so often, and again, we talked about earlier, there is something in us that desires to do something unique and great, and that is absolutely God given. But the way that we define unique and great is sometimes what needs to be tweaked. And so this reminder that starting small and being faithful with a little is so often the way that God does things. I love Paul's honesty in telling his own story, that when he has his miraculous moment on the road to Damascus and his sight is taken away and then it's restored, there's, there's a moment, apparently immediately following that encounter where he begins to teach and preach and it has an effect. But then Paul tells his own story at the beginning of Galatians, where he says, and not long after that, I went out into the desert of Asia minor for 10 years. Yeah. Right. He didn't suddenly get on a speaking circuit. Right. And then he comes back and he interacts with some of the other apostles and disciples at that point. And then he's back out in the desert for like four more years. Yeah. And then, then we get to experience the Paul that we experienced in the new Testament. And I think for so many of us, we miss the journey that he took. We miss the journey that the disciples took as Jesus was sending them out and they were coming back like, Hey man, we tried to this work, this work. What was that? Right. Right. It's start small and be faithful with a little. That doesn't mean you're deficient. It doesn't mean you're behind. We have again, this 21st century Western mindset of you're supposed to be an overnight success. And the thing I love about overnight successes is if you ask most of them, most of them will tell you the story of how they failed 37 other times before they hit their overnight success. Right. Right. And we often only see the final product, right. Or the most mature version of the product. And we miss the journey. And that causes us to question our own journey. But this is the journey we all have to take with our giftings. And we have to reject almost completely the lie of success. Yeah. And that is, you know, lie I'm talking about there is the set success defines the value of the journey. And, and because success in our use of our spiritual gifts, you might not ever know. Yeah. I mean, you might not ever know that success really in the use of our spiritual gifts comes in the satisfaction with your savior. Yeah. I mean, that's, that's really at the end of the day, did I show up in a way that God wanted me to show up? And did I give myself in the way that God would, would be honored and glorified? And can I sense, I love how the old Testament says it, can I sense the smile of God over my life? That needs to be our new success metric. Yeah. Regardless of what the response is. And we may never be celebrity. We may never have, you know, the algorithms say we are at the top of the heap. Yeah. Right. What matters is what the King says. Yeah. Well done. Exactly. And, and that's the satisfaction. That's, that's where we have to just get rid of that lie about success and results and, and lean into success is, is pleasing the savior. Yeah. That, that then there's a freedom in that. Yeah. So, yeah. So if you made it this far we actually have a couple past episodes where we've talked about gifting. So if you go back to the April, 2023, the series that we call the heartbeat weeks, two and three, we had back-to-back episodes on this idea of discovering your passion, discovering your gifting and how to live out of it. So if this is just stoking a thirst in you, uh, plenty more where this came from. Um, and as always the invitation is to continue the conversation either with other people, as you listen to this, or if you've got questions or just want to share part of your story, email us at faith forward at CFC wire dot O R G. And we would love to continue that interaction because as always we're on this journey too. Absolutely. And, and just, I know you're wrapping up and just before you do the sign off and the wrap up, can I, I just want to say one thing in, in kind of conclusion, cause we, you know, we've kind of ended this in the being practical. I just want to get really, really, really practical for a minute. One, if you walk away from this and you don't want to go chase other podcasts, you don't want to go listen to other sermons, but you go, okay, I do think I have responsibility. One, start the journey of discovery and the journey of discovery can start with an inventory, a test, but, uh, includes spending time with Jesus, letting the Holy spirit speak to you, point out those things and be in community with other people who can look at you and say, I see that one, two, you know, discover, then develop, lean into where it is that you sense that God is saying, that's how I've made you and grow in that. And three, we didn't talk a whole ton about this. And that's why I wanted to come back and say this, deploy it just because you've identified it and you have read about it and researched it and flex the muscle and all that kind of stuff. That's no good unless you put it into use and we need you to put it into use. And when I say we, I'm talking about the community of faith. We, we don't work if a part of us is missing. And so find a place to use your gift and you, we're going to do our best on the church side to say here, the doors open and here are a variety of places. But if you can't find that place and that door doesn't seem clear to you, start banging on doors and find a place to use your gift. Don't just say I have the gift, use the gift. So I'll leave that there and lean back to you. You can finish the wrap up. I just wanted to do that real practical, discover, develop and deploy. Yeah, that's good. So again, you got questions, you've got curiosities, you want to figure out where to best deploy. Shoot us an email. We would love to have that conversation. We would love to take those steps with you. So Lee, thanks as always. Thanks for having me. Always a good time. I love hanging out. And we'll see you all next time on the Faith Forward podcast. Have a great week.
