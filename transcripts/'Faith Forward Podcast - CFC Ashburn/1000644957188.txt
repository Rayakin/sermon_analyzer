Welcome back to the Faith Forward podcast, John Ackerman, Brian Bales, and this is finally the 100th episode, which I don't, I feel like that matters. Not a huge thing. I feel like we should have some theme music, but we're not going to put it on the show. There you go. That was our music. It's making me think of that State Farm commercial with Patrick Mahomes, most valuable bundler where he takes confetti out of his jacket. I do appreciate that commercial. It's pretty funny. It's just a little jacket confetti. So we're wrapping up this series that we've been in for the last three weeks about Better Together. Right. The totality of the last six weeks of looking at what's next and what's next, meaning we need to be both giveaway people and better together. And so as we wrap up this series and as we talk about this week, we actually have a little bit of a role reversal. Yeah, we do. But before we do this in the role reversal, what I want to tell people, if you've been listening to this or watching this over time, we talked about 100th episode special. This is our 100th episode. However, you may be like, well, you're not sharing the stories. What I want you to know is, is that we're going to release that as a standalone sort of smaller thing sometime this week. So look out for it. You're like, well, what is this week? I'm watching this in 2026. Well, this is 2024 right now. We're recording this in the month of February. First couple of weeks. So just, you know, heads up on that sort of thing. You're probably going to get to it later. But since we're reversing roles because of the fact that usually what happens is, is John goes to me at this point or whoever's sitting in this chair to talk about what we've talked about in this series specifically on Sunday. But interestingly enough, John, you spoke this Sunday or will be speaking for longtime listeners know that we do this a little beforehand. And so what you did on Sunday was take the third aspect of what we've been attempting to understand and connecting it all together. We've said to be the people God wants us to be, to accomplish the vision God wants us to accomplish. We have to be people who are giveaway people. That was the first half of the series and the second half of the series. We have to be people who understand we are better together and the word that we're using to describe better together is community. But what we've said in the series over and over again is that we can use words that are defined differently. And so for the purpose of our conversation at Christian Fellowship Church, for the purpose of our conversation in this Faith Forward podcast, we have defined this is how we mean community when we say it. Community is when our story, our life, the things internally and externally that we expose and don't want to expose is known, shown, and then grown in the context, and this is key, of biblical love. Because you can have community that's known, shown, and grown, not in the context of biblical love. That's driving all of it. So I did the no in the show and I passed it to you for grow. And what I love about what we said before we hopped on the podcast today was there is so many, many things we could have talked about each one of these. And in fact, many times the challenge, and you knew this as a teacher so many times in the times you speak here at CFC, I know this, it's not what am I going to say, it's what am I not going to say. It actually is not easier for the listener, but for the teacher, it's easier to do a two and a half hour. Let's just put it all there and walk it through because we feel like we cover the content. So what you talked about on Sunday isn't designed to be the full buffet of everything, but in many ways, it's helping people a little bit more understand how their story can be grown. So with that tag back to you. Yeah. Like you said that the challenge was how to make it digestible, how to make it accessible without covering everything. And so the simplest definition that we had for what it means to have your story be grown after moving through the known and shown piece is that your story has grown in community as you regularly and authentically, both are important. Authenticity and intentionality engage in knowing and showing over time. Yeah. And so it's really just do whatever we said from the last two weeks over and over for a long, long time. Yeah. That's the simplest summary of the message. But as we delved into the grown part of it, what does it look like to do this over time? It is the reality that first and foremost, like you mentioned that this has to happen over time. There is no way to microwave this. There is no fast track for this. There's no shortcut that true growth of transformational community, because again, that's the target. That's the bullseye that we're aiming for. Transformational community, not just friend groups, not just social circles, not just in an increasing quantity of acquaintances, but achieving transformational community, the space where I am changed because of who I'm around and because of the amount that I've invested myself in them and they have invested themselves in me. That has to happen over time. That's actually where its value is largely derived from is the length of the investment as well as what's been put in. You know, you made me think I just actually was spending some time with people recently doing premarital counseling. And one of the things that I've said for years is you can't microwave a relationship in this in this way. And I think people receive it in dating or marriage, but maybe have a harder time to receive it in what we're talking about. So for example, if they say to become a professional something, it takes 10,000 hours of work. That 10,000 hours probably works better over a period of years, not five straight years. In the same way, say, to really know someone, I'm just going to throw out a number. You have to do this, say, 200 hours, I'm just making up a number. I don't know what it is. Well, you could say, well, let's spend every day together eight hours a day for five weeks. And I'm going to say that's not as effective simply because you're not having an opportunity to go through seasons of life, going through holidays, going through moments where we're experiencing something. And for me, and maybe you, if you're listening or watching, sometimes that's hard because, you know, we feel like we do, we want to microwave something. But maybe if you're struggling with this idea, like, oh, I'm making this commitment for something that seems to be long, that's not meant to be pressure. What that means is there's this balance between education and effort properly used over time. So it's not, hey, if it's 20 minutes at 400 degrees, it's 40 minutes at 800 or 10 minutes at 800. Exactly. Yeah. And so we're going to flesh some of this out today when it comes to practical aspects. But a couple of the things that we highlighted in the Sunday message was some of this growth, like you said, it has to happen over time, but time is not the only critical factor. It's also what we're bringing into this transformational community. And primarily the value of what we bring is what's cultivated from the inside out. That it's not just our gifts and our serving, but it's the way that we have been cultivated, that we have been developed, that our giftings, our abilities, all of those things have been developed inside of us to then be transformed as they come out of us. And we're going to flesh that out a little bit more. But it's, and again, it's not just the serving. It's not just the doing. It's the transformation inside of us that comes as we better understand our own story. Remember, part of what we've been talking about with community is your story being known. And that means by you as well. That means you being aware of the good and the bad in your story and the effect that that's had on you. And so as we are transformed from the inside out, we bring a greater capacity for transformation in the community around us. And that leads us then to this other facet, which is community is truly grown transformationally when it's symbiotic. Right? And you use this phrase right before we hit play, that it symbiotically means mutually beneficial over time, that it's not always equal. It's not always even, but there has to be this rhythm. There has to be this flow of the give and the take of offering and of receiving. And if it's only ever one way, you're not going to get the same transformational effect. You're going to end up with something that's very lopsided and in most cases pretty unhealthy. And then the last thing that we talked about on Sunday is that the necessity for transformational community, the necessity for growth in community, is that it actually points us back to God. It not only provides a witness and a testimony for God to the world around us, right? The absolute miracle of there's no way people this different and this jacked up, to borrow your expression, should be able to coexist and flourish together, but for God. But as we also experience transformational community with each other, we will inevitably keep pointing each other back to God and discovering new facets of our relationship with God because of our relationship with people. And so there's, it's a little bit selfishly motivated, but part of my desire to be in transformational community is I want to discover more of who God is. And the easiest way for me to do that is to discover who other people have discovered God to be. So that's where we're hopefully going on Sunday. Again, it's Thursday. Who knows what's going to happen between now and then, but that's the hope. As we bring it back to, as we bring it back to today's podcast of how do we take all this and become practical? Part of the challenge is we're talking about something that has to happen over time. And so we can't necessarily just go and do this thing starting today. And so some of this is sort of planting the flag way out there and going, here's the thing that we're moving towards. It was also striking me that as we talk about getting to this level of your transformational community being grown and you being grown in transformational community, we actually be talking to two different audiences or maybe you in two different parts of your life. And for some, you've got the beginnings of community. You're walking through the known and shown aspects. And right now it's the waiting for the development over time. But I also recognize, and this was one of the things that jumped out to me as I was looking at sort of the anchor section of the scriptures that we were using for this series in Acts. Jesus's initial followers, not only the 12, now 11 disciples, but Acts talks about about 120 people that were in and around that room during the time of Pentecost. That's a pretty solid community that's been practicing known and shown for some version of three years. Not everybody started right at the beginning, but, and it is that almost day to day, right? They weren't just showing up on Sundays with each other. This was pretty intentional and pretty frequent connection. And then all of a sudden, Peter preaches this first message and there's 3000 new people. And now there's a bit of a hard reset. And we've experienced some of that here at this church, that as we transitioned from our old building to this new one, there were a fair number of people that came along for the ride. And then there were a fair number of people that discovered a church had just opened up in their backyard and they're like, Hey, we're going to come check it out. And about half of our current church population based on our latest survey only knows this church community in its newest iteration. Yeah. And for context, in March, April, our building would have been open theoretically for four years. We had some pandemic issues. We opened up before that. So if you're listening to this and like, well, if the building's been around 10 years, I mean, this is four years and of that, a lot of it was pandemic time. It was a really short time, right? And so we're finding ourselves in the midst of this same sort of transition of, we've got some people whose community connection goes back a decade, two decades. We've got some people here from the original founding of this building 46 years ago. And we've got a whole bunch of people that were just added. And so how do you cultivate transformational community in this season of what almost feels like starting over? And so we're going to approach this last episode of this series, this topic of grown, sort of through that split lens of, for some of us, we're cultivating our initial community. And for some of us, we're incorporating new people into an existing one, or maybe even our existing community seems to have had its season and we're now starting over, but with a taste of what transformational community looks like. So with all of that said, we're going to come back to this starting point of this can only happen over time, whether this is your first run through or your third grow around in cultivating transformational community, it has to happen over time. And one of the first, most practical things that we can talk about is this cannot be just finding more people like me. And so Brian, one of the things that I've heard you talk about before is the trap and the danger of the mirror effect as we're cultivating community. So say a little something about that. So here's how it works. We're on this journey to grow more like Jesus. And by definition, when we begin to do it in isolation, our experiences are limited to us. And so that means oftentimes when we see people who are walking in the same experience, walking in the same way, walking in the same giftings, we think, ah, these are exactly people who are growing like Jesus as well. They might be, but the mirror effect means you're really looking at yourself in some ways. So we often think people that are like us immediately are more like Jesus, because if we're on this journey and we're trying to be more like Jesus and they're like us, they might be more like Jesus. And that may be true or may not be true. But the temptation then is to then get around people only more like us. And really what we're looking for isn't necessarily the outward expressions. We're looking for the inward principles and guiding things that that affect them. And so an analogy I was thinking of is, is that, you know, I this Sunday again, I joke it's the 58th anniversary of my team not being in the Super Bowl. Right. And so I could walk into church or some community and I could have a jersey on that said my preferred team and I could see someone else had a jersey on and said my preferred team. I could immediately think things about that person. Some might be true. Some might not be true. They might have that jersey because someone got it for a gag gift because my team can be a laugh many times. They might have this jersey because they love their spouse, but not because they love their team. They might have this jersey because they know someone who works for the team, but they're not a fan per se. But if I immediately assume because they're wearing the same jersey that the same inner things that drive them in their fandom, we're not going to connect. Hopefully you get the illustration. I think it's really easy many times to see people and to immediately only put the people around us who wear the same outward jersey. And even if inwardly they're the same, we're still going to miss the benefit, the benefit, the benefits, the term I'm looking for, of what it's like to have other people who still love football but may cheer for different teams and grow. But I think we do that, number one, by accident. Right. We just assume people who are like me are becoming more like Jesus. But also we do it because even if we find the people who are like us who are becoming more like Jesus, it is easier. But just because it's easier doesn't mean it's actually helping us grow in the manner that we're helping to grow. And that's, I think, some of the things as we think about that, when we think about going to step out in the community and we find a community and grow, don't just automatically look for the people who, if you looked in the mirror, they seem a whole lot like you. On the outside, the inside stuff matters first. And it's absolutely understandable. Right. This desire for sameness, this attraction towards sameness, it's the high school cafeteria lunch table. Right. I want to sit near the people that are like me, that do the things that I do, that like the things that I like. And there's nothing wrong with that. No, there's not a thing wrong with that. And it's not a but. And if we want to be transformed, there have to be places of friction, there have to be opportunities for abrasion, there have to be opportunities for iron to sharpen iron. And it just it got me thinking that and we talk a lot here about wanting to be indispensable to the community around us, whether it's the community outside of this building or the community that calls Christian Fellowship home or the community that helps to drive a lot of what happens inside of this building. And it's easy to lose track of the reality that being indispensable to people means that oftentimes you need a diverse group of people in order to be indispensable, not a very, very similar group of people like hearted is a great similarity, like gifted is a potential trap. And it just it got me thinking about so often my mind turns to books and movies, to story, because we live in a story Jesus taught so often in stories. There's just something about story that hits the heart. It got me thinking about the Marvel universe, the DC universe, right? The the success of those teams. I understand it's fiction. I understand it's not real, but it works because they're different. It works because they have not only different giftings, different powers, but they have different personalities. They have different ways of seeing the world. They have a different sense of prioritization of what is most important, of who is most important, of what most needs to be protected. It got me thinking about Disney movies, The Lion King. Simba needs and again, just run with me here for a second. It's going to make sense, I promise. Simba, as he's sent into exile after the death of his father, spoiler movies like 800 years old at this point, he needs Timon and Pumbaa to help him in his short term recovery. But then that little community becomes dysfunctional because they've really embraced Hakuna Matata to a detrimental level. And so they need Simba's childhood friend Nala to show up and be a little abrasive of you are called to something higher. You have forgotten who you are. They need the monkey to show up. They need Rafiki to show up. He's got to show up and smack some people with that stick and the coconuts or whatever. You've forgotten who you are. You have a higher calling. You have a place. You have a community that needs you and you have something to offer them. We need disruption in our community. Yeah. And one of the things that they understand, these writers, these authors about human nature, is that people, when they see these movies, they need to see themselves in there so they can relate. What I want to take that turn and we talk about from the standpoint of our biblical community, if we're not careful, what we accidentally do is if we're not very strategic in having diversity around like-mindedness and like-heartedness, not like giftedness, but diversity in our giftedness, the sameness in our like-heartedness and like-mindedness, what we're going to do is create a community both, you know, at the church that you may attend, if it's this one or some else, or something smaller that says, if you don't look this way, you don't fit. If you don't express this gifting, you don't fit. And I think by accident, no one of us would ever say, oh, you're not welcome. But when we only seek out people who have sameness in those particular ways, it does communicate that message. And I think that's something that the writers really understand about human nature, whether they're, you know, writing and say they're writing it to make money. Yeah. God understands when he put together the original community with Adam and Eve, there was difference. Jesus, when he put together the disciples, right, very strategically, there was something there because what he had for them as they as they went from their beginning community out into the world to be indispensable that they were called to, they had to learn and grow from each other. Yeah. Because it helped Peter be a better person having John around them. Yeah. You know, it each of them could say, I would just love to have heard the conversations between, you know, Matthew slash Levi, the tax collector and Simon, the zealot. Yeah, completely different views, but like minded and hearted in that way. So, yeah, that's a great reminder. And again, remember, we're talking about the grown portion of known, shown and grown. We're not necessarily talking about the outset as you're creating the initial team. We're talking about the necessity of diversity over time. Yeah. Good reminder. Making me think it makes me think about the disciples and in the beginning of Acts, Paul's not there yet. And the disruption and the growth that Paul brings by being invited into an existing community. Right. Because he wasn't part of the original twelve. Right. Right. Yeah. We sometimes forget that Paul wasn't always there because of how prevalent he is in the New Testament. Yeah. Right. But he's a late comer. And and so as we're looking at the grown aspect, the recognition that we often need addition to our community. So this isn't just at the outset. This is over time. Another thing that we've talked about back in the known and shown sections was the pace of growth, the the the pace of creating depth in your community. And I talked a little bit on Sunday about too fast and too slow. That again, you can't microwave this, it's not possible, but you can actually delay the growth of transformational community. And so I've got a couple of questions that I've found helpful in helping depth continue to be created over time. But as we were talking about this, Brian, one of the things that you brought up is this idea of when is patience a virtue and when is it a stalling tactic as you're developing community? So the simplest answer, we're 20 some minutes into this. We've not said, ask God, ask God, that's the simplest answer. But I can give you some things as you think about taking your faith forward is this, is that patience is a virtue when you find yourself in a necessity to trust. God patience is a stalling tactic when you find yourself motivated more by a spirit of fear than the spirit of the Holy Spirit. Now, we're going to talk in just a second about fear because fear itself isn't always unhealthy. There's a lot of things that are hard and difficult around growing in your community. But that's that fear that comes in. It's not meant to drive you away from that. So, number one, ask God. But number two, then begin, you know, with the help of the Holy Spirit to take an internal look. What in this moment of patience is this me trustingly ask, you know, talking to God and trusting him in his time and in his way. That's why I'm being patient. Or am I just using what I like to say? Really good spiritual language to cover up my really bad fleshly desire. And that is I'm being really controlled by the spirit of fear and the Holy Spirit have asked me to step in and to grow deeper. I'm like, no, no, not yet. Not yet. Because, you know, there is a reason to be healthy fear. And then there's unhealthy fear. Right. Yeah, absolutely. And again, from the place of growing deeper in your transformational community, it's always scary to go a little bit further in the direction of not just vulnerability, but like we talked about on Sunday, transparency where people see you even when you'd really prefer that they not. Yeah, you've got me singing a song. Just I'll let you know. You didn't do it intentionally. I think this time I didn't do this. But for anyone who's ever seen the greatest showman and you just need to sing when it comes to community, never enough, never, never, because we can get complacence. It's enough. But what God has for us on this journey, there is always to use the third name of our podcast more. And if we find ourselves in a place of complacency and we have seen this happen a lot, people engage community and they engage it like, oh, I've always wanted this. And they get this like, oh, it's enough. Yeah, but there's more. There is there is. And now I've got this is me from the greatest show and running in my head that it's the invitation to see the fullness of who I am and for me to experience the fullness of who I am. Yeah. And so a buddy of mine that I've been in a transformational relationship with for the better part of a decade at this point, he heard a message from another pastor at another church one time and that pastor was talking about how he would like he's like, I'm a pastor. I want to get to the heart of people. And so he'd walk around and ask people, how's your inner man? And it was a seriously disruptive question for people like, you know, if I just met you at a coffee shop, like, whoa, dude, what does that even mean? Yeah. But the context of it was, let's get past the surface. Let's get past favorite sports team. Let's get past what you did over the weekend. How are you doing on the inside? How are you doing spiritually? How are you doing emotionally? How are you and God doing? Let's get down to the nitty gritty. And so my friend and I have started using this question half jokingly, but always very intentionally of after we've been talking for a few minutes. Hey, how's your inner man? Let's cut through the fluff and actually get down to a place of depth. We were at a Thanksgiving, you know, like a Friendsgiving sort of thing this past fall. And he and I were on opposite sides of the table, but far enough away that cross talk would have just been a little bit disruptive. And we didn't know most of the other people at this thing. And so we were watching each other try to engage in the small talk and neither one of us being terribly satisfied with it because we enjoy the depth of connection. And so finally, I text him because he has a smartwatch. And so I knew it would pop up. I'm like, hey, ask the guy next to you about his inner man. And, you know, a bunch of winky faces and smiley faces and things like that. And he did it. Now, he did it in a kind way, right? He didn't just drop it on this guy. Like, here's a question that doesn't make sense to make you feel uncomfortable because we just met 30 seconds ago. But he did a beautiful job of, hey, so this and then this, but not this. And so I'm just I'm really curious, like what's going on at a deeper place in you? And I watched them have a beautiful conversation for about the next 15 minutes. And we got done and he's like, you're such a jerk. But it was a great moment for me of recognition of you can invite people into depth in an authentic way and in a healthy way. And it's just helpful to have those things in your back pocket, both in your existing community as you're creating depth and as you're inviting people into your existing community to create depth. And so how's your inner man is a question that works in my community. Feel free to hijack that. There's a couple other questions that I've found helpful in the spaces that I've grown in. And it's things like, what effect do I have in our relationship? Both the positive and the negative. Help me see myself and the effect that I'm having in this space. What effect do I have in this community? And then asking the other person, where do you feel like I'm holding back in our relationship? Where do you think I have more to offer? It's a really beautiful place to cultivate depth and growth, to to take the community deeper and to risk having some of those abrasive, frictional conversations that prompt a different way of thinking. So I don't know if you've got any thoughts on that. Otherwise, we'll move along to the next thing. Do I have anything to add? I always have something to add. I think the one thing I would say here is you were asking that question for the listeners and I was processing it myself. Where are you holding back? And the truth is, lots of times I'm unaware of where I'm holding back. Absolutely. I'd like to think that that's because I'm trying to be intentional in my life. Sure. But sometimes there are just times that we have blind spots. And I think this also gives us the necessity of community, but also growth in time over community, because for lots of us, as we get longer into this relationship, then it will become if we're in people that we're just not mirroring them all the time, it'll become more obvious over time where we might be holding back. And so if you ask me that question, I would tell you right now, I'm not sure. But I imagine you may have a couple of thoughts about me. Just the person. Hey, this you're holding back. So if I trusted you to ask the question, we had that relationship. I would probably trust you. And I do to say, you know, I'm not really sure. I'm sure there's areas, but I know I'm not intentionally doing it. So talk to me about from your point of view, from your perception where I am holding back or it certainly comes across like I'm holding back, because those are two different things, because knowing ourselves and how we come across helps our relationships grow and knowing ourselves and say, no, no, we're coming across exactly how we're intending to, not by accident, that also in that way. So I think I would just I would say that because what we're moving towards is really this next aspect that you've meant about having authentic, vulnerable, transparent relationships. And those questions that you brought up aren't questions certainly that can easily be asked and answered at a level. Let me say it this way. At that Thanksgiving deal, that was probably a sincere answer that the conversation happened at 15 minutes. I would imagine if that person who asked the question, the person they were talking to grew over time, that question goes deeper. And so the questions are valuable for whatever level you are in the growth of your relationship, but they will always go deeper. And so that's this idea about authentic and vulnerable and transparent over time, because sometimes there's about three or four things we got to get to to get to the thing. Absolutely. And so I love about the fact that, you know, when you made this point about in Luke chapter nine, twenty thirty six is Jesus transfiguration. They were seeing Jesus, the disciples. I think that's where you're going with it. But then they saw Jesus in his full form. And obviously we are representing Jesus. We have Jesus spirit in us. We have the image of God in us. I don't think there's going to be a moment where you and I are hanging out on some mountain just because, number one, I don't camp. And number two, even if I did, where all of a sudden you're going to see me in the same way they saw there. But I think the point that you're trying to drive to is there are moments in life where we see the truer form and we're not trying to be mystical of that. What we're saying by truing form is when all that other stuff, not always bad stuff, but just stuff is ripped away and you begin to see the aspect of the image of God at a greater point in there, the aspect of the Holy Spirit working through there. And in some cases, in a lot of cases with me, you see the truest forms of the fears and the junk that I've carried since very, very young that still show up in my life more than I want to. And there's something about that vulnerable moment to trust someone in there. But it's also there's nothing like being seen and it's scary. There's fear. But then growing in that, that's what that's what takes it to the next step. Yeah. Yeah. I usually spend about 15 minutes on this in the fourth week of our square one class. And so I didn't spend a lot of time on Sunday fleshing this out, nor am I going to spend a lot of time on it here. So we'd invite you to come for it. Just come for that fourth week if you want and see if it has value. Then show up for the other three. But the authenticity for us starts with we have to know ourselves and then offer that version of us all the time, not be one version of ourself in some environments and another version of ourself and others, because that's what gives us acceptance and validation and approval in each of those spaces. Vulnerability. You have to invite people to begin to know the real parts of your story, not just the parts you're comfortable putting out on social media. Hey, everything's great. We went to the amusement park today. But the transparency is this moment of Jesus's transfiguration where they see him as he truly is. And C.S. Lewis has this incredible quote from the weight of glory that to me just really encapsulates this idea of part of transformational community is designed to help us see each other at both our absolute best in our glory and at our worst, because that is the truth of who we are. And so Lewis says this, it's a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses to remember that the dullest, most uninteresting person you can talk to may one day be a creature which if you saw it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship or else a horror and a corruption such as you now meet, if at all, only in a nightmare. All day long, we are in some degree helping each other to one or the other of these destinations. It's in the light of these overwhelming possibilities. It is with the awe and the circumspection proper to them that we should conduct all of our dealings with one another, all friendships, all loves, all play, all politics. There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal. Nations, cultures, arts, civilizations, these are mortal and their life is to ours as the life of a gnat. But it is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub and exploit. Immortal horrors or everlasting splendors. That's the reality of who you and I interact with, with each other and with all the people around us. There is a glory that we possess as image bearers of the living God, and there is a brokenness in us that can lead us down all sorts of horrible paths in our development, in our becoming. And like he says in the middle there, this is the purpose of community. All day long, we are in some degree helping each other to one or the other of these destinations. Do you see the people in your transformational community? In this light, as people that if you met them in other circumstances, he's talking about like when we're in heaven with God, that you would be tempted to bow down in worship as the refined, the perfected image of God. Is that how we go about our interactions? Is that the depth to which we seek to know and understand ourselves and each other? That level of transparency is essential as we cultivate transformational community. But I think really sort of brings us to another just thought that seems obvious at first, but lots of times we go at it differently than this, that actual spiritual formation, spiritual growth, growth in community, growth in being the people God wants, acts as an inside out sort of thing. We've said in everyone knows show and grow that one of the practical steps is you've got to initiate instead of expect to be initiated on. I recently heard this definition and I loved it about spiritual formation. And this person invited you to think about spiritual formation in the same way you think about your physical formation, whether you're passive or intentional, you're always being affected physically in your formation. Are you sitting at a desk? What's the weather around you? What are you putting into your body or what are you not putting in your body? Whether your intentionality is there or not, the point is you are constantly being formed. And so no, this spiritual formation isn't something that any of us have the opportunity to not do. Our internal, our, our soul, our mind, our emotions, our will are constantly being formed. The difference is whether or not we're approaching it with an intentional aspect or we're doing it in an unintentional aspect. There is no such thing as I'm not being formed spiritually. We just are. We just are by a lack of doing things or by our intent of doing things. And so are the depth of our transformational community is limited by our proactivity. If we're not the type of people who are willing to pursue our own transformation, put ourselves and I don't like the term on a plan because there's way too much problems with that term, but put ourselves on an intentional pathway. Let me use that term instead. We're going to run into problems and it's not like we're going to stay neutral any more than like if my physical body just said, I'm just going to sit at a desk, you know, right now my hips are killing me. If I'm, if you're watching this and I seem mad, I'm not, my hips are killing me today. I need to get up and move around because there's something about my body that's being formed even in my passivity. Yeah. Yeah. And that's, that's one of the really helpful things I think to be on the lookout for as you are cultivating your transformational community is you want to be surrounded by people who want transformational community, not just community. And I've been in spaces where that's been sort of the dividing line. And in some cases that's actually caused some unhealthy friction, not friction that creates a growth, but friction that creates distance of some people that said, look, I just want a group that I can hang out with on the weekends and watch the game with. There's nothing wrong with that. No, but that's not the same thing. It can be born out of that, but you will not get that from only doing the same thing. And going back to that analogy, there's nothing wrong with that. But if that's all that you have, you are still being spiritually formed. You are. It's not like, oh, well, I'm choosing not to be spiritually formed because I just said, actually, there's still a choice. Right. And that formation, more likely than not, barring some miraculous intervention and providing the Holy Spirit in our life and intentionality of us being obedient will be less spiritually formed, much like our physical bodies will be less. Yeah. And so as you're looking at your own willingness to be transformed from the inside out, take a look at the community in which you find yourself in the community that you're cultivating for yourself and recognize that it's really good to be surrounded by others who are pursuing their own growth and transformation. At some point, we have to want it for ourselves. It's not enough to just be on the team at that point. This is not a spectator sport. This is not a sport that makes a lot of room for fans. The bleachers in this game are infinitesimally small and the field is huge. This is a game that is meant to be played, not a game that is meant to be watched. And that may require some hard conversations with the community that you're developing. Similarly, and you mentioned this earlier, the depth of our transformational community is somewhat limited by what we know. But like we've talked about that word no on this platform ad nauseum at this point, that's not just intellectually what you know, but it's experientially what you know. Yeah. Just a little side note. I've not said this in a sermon, but I can say on the podcast, right? Lots of times in the Old Testament, that word no is used. It's talking about sexual relationships, right? And so no one says, you know that intellectually. And so I'm not saying you think about it that way. But I'm saying the Bible, when it uses this, is always talking about experiential of something that is informed by knowledge. But it's never just theoretically. Yeah. And so that's part of what has to be grown in your transformational spaces is a diversity of understanding and experience. Again, part of what Paul brings to the table as he joins that early community is one, he wasn't part of the original crew, but he had a pretty dramatic experience with Jesus himself. And then he had a sustained period of cultivation out in the desert. And he brings with him his own experiences and perspectives, and it creates some places of abrasion and friction, but it creates some really good opportunities for the community as a whole to benefit. Yeah, I want to example that real quick. I know we're getting near the end of our time, but I think one of the greatest examples is when Paul in the book of Acts comes to Peter and he confronts him in a good way about the way that Peter was dealing with people who weren't Jewish from ethnicity background. And one of the interesting things was, is that there were a whole bunch of other disciples that knew Peter. But for one reason or another, God designed it that Paul would come in and do that, maybe because Paul was new. He had less whatever about Peter. Sure. Maybe, Paul, as we look at scripture, Peter seemed to have a pretty outgoing personality. Maybe Paul's giftings and personality was the only person that could actually get through to Peter. We don't know, but we see that there was something Peter wasn't seeing that Paul had to bring to his attention. Was it hard? Yes. But was it good and made Peter more like Jesus? Absolutely. Yeah. And that takes us, that's a great example of the next thing that we're talking about, which is the necessity of symbiotic growth. Like you said earlier, mutually beneficial over time, that there are seasons where we're primarily receiving. There may be seasons where we're giving more than usual, but when we get to not just the known and not just the shown, but doing known and shown over time, we have to cultivate healthy two-way connection in our relationships there. And for some of us, that's going to be difficult because our lived experience has predisposed us towards one or the other. Yeah. I know in my life I've gotten very, very comfortable with one way giving. Let me just sacrifice for others. Let me put myself last. Let me give and give and give and give of time, of resources, of whatever. I have a really hard time being on the receiving end. And I talked before, even in just the last couple episodes, that that's one of the things that's made it difficult for my friends to be friends with me, is I've created the impression in our relationships, I don't need anything. And frankly, I don't want anything. And so be aware of that. Be aware of your level of symbiosis in your transformational community and use that as a barometer for the health of your community in general. It's one of the beautiful things about Acts is in that second chapter, everyone is giving and everyone is benefiting. Yep. That's what we're looking for. And so as we come to the close, the last thing that we talked about on Sunday was that transformational growth in community is happening for a reason. Both because it points the world outside of your community back to God and makes people go, there is no way. There is no way on this earth that that group of people could be together and not kill each other, but for God. But it's also the realization that the reason God puts us in transformational community, the reason he invites us, Jesus's prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane, I've given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one. I in them and you in me. The purpose is for us to be so close that we experience the same oneness that Jesus has with the Father, that we experience oneness with Jesus in the way that Jesus experiences oneness with the Father because of the oneness that we cultivate with each other. It's a bit of a mind trip for me, but it just reminds me that this is what transformational community is about. It's not just about serving and doing good for others. It's not just about solving problems, because frankly, God could do that better than we ever could. Yeah, and he does far better than we ever could. But it's primarily about connection. It brings us back to when Jesus was asked, what's the greatest commandment? I don't think he hesitated long in answering. It's love God, love God with all your heart. And as we talked about before in the first part of the six week series, love God with all your heart and then learn to love yourself the way that God loves you. And learning to love yourself the way that God loves you often requires being loved by others, seeing the tangible expression of love and wrestling with the discomfort of recognizing you don't deserve to be loved that way. And yet people just seem to love you. Yeah. And you have to confront the difficult reality that you are loved and that you need to love yourself that way. And that as you learn to love yourself that way, because you are loved, you love others better and provide the exact same service of helping them to realize this is how loved you are, because this is how worthy of love you are, because this is how much God loves you, because this is how much God loves me. And that's the goal of transformational community. We'll solve a whole bunch of problems along the way, but that's the goal. Yeah, and having the goal matters. Understanding it, you know, I heard someone recently say the greatest thing God wants to do with your life is transform your life. Yeah. He needs nothing from us. And so those of us who are very goal oriented don't don't get the wrong goal. It's not, hey, we're going to have eight friends in transformational community. It's that he transforms us through the transformational community. And that could be hard to receive, but it's true. And when that happens, I think there's there's something about experiencing transformational community in the context of biblical love known, shown and grown. That man, when you have it, you don't want to settle for anything else doesn't mean it's not scary, doesn't mean it's not even in some ways dangerous, but man, it's it's beautiful because that's when it begins to work the way God designed. And whenever we're in the place living out from the design of God, individually, communally, whatever may be, it's always a better place. So. So whether you just found us or you've been with us for all a hundred episodes, thank you for being the kind of people that want to walk with God, that want to take their faith forward, that will want to be transformed and that want to share that transformation with others. So he's Brian. I'm John. Thank you for being a part of this. We'll see you next time.
