Welcome back to the Faith Forward Podcast, I'm John Ackerman. Mike Haines hanging out today. Last week you got Lee, this week you get Mike. We've kicked Brian out for a little while, which I think he had it coming. Yeah. Oh, well, it's about time. Yeah. Yeah. It was time. Yeah. Um, so if you've been with us for a little while, you know that we're in the fifth week of this series coming out of the book of Nehemiah that we've titled For Something Greater. And as is always the invitation, I'll probably say it a few more times. If you haven't caught the Sunday messages, you really want those for context, but the highlight reel summary of the previous four weeks has gone something like this. Brian kicked us off in the first week talking about the idea that God placed a burden on Nehemiah's heart, and he's not stopped doing that with people yet. But the very first invitation, just like with Nehemiah is to be clear in our understanding that the Lord is putting this burden on our heart and that this isn't just our burden for what we think God wants us to do. Yeah. So that's a good place to start, right? Make sure it's God. The second step then was that to live a life for something greater, to, to truly invest in the kingdom in the way that God's inviting us to through this burden that he's placed on us, it's going to require a greater prayer life and greater risk. And we tried to clarify the greater prayer life doesn't mean more words. It doesn't mean setting aside more time for more words. It means more connection. It means more intimacy. It in many cases means more listening rather than talking, which is what Nehemiah does. We talked about the amount of time that Nehemiah spent months praying, not just speaking words, but listening for what God was wanting him to do, waiting for clarification of what God was wanting him to do, but then also greater risk, right? It required stepping into discomfort of leaving a pretty plush assignment as you were mentioning on Sunday and, and stepping into a place where he didn't know how things were going to work out. He didn't know if he would be okay. He didn't know if things were going to come through as he hoped. And so it is for us. And then in the third week, Brian was talking about the reality that as we step into this thing that God has called us into this, this thing that is greater than us that we can't do on our own, there's going to be detours and there's going to be distractions and it requires a level of discernment to recognize which one's which. We talked about the importance of the spirit of wisdom and the spirit of revelation and both of those being separate from just our wisdom. And then last week, uh, hopefully you caught Lee's message that he was talking about that this idea of for something greater fundamentally requires more than me, more than you, more than any one of us. And frankly, even more than what God can do with one of us, that the, the truly something greaters require all of us requires more than me. It requires more than what I have. It requires more than what I can do. And so as we step into this fifth week and we got a couple more weeks coming after this, believe it or not, cause we ain't done yet. Mike, you were talking this Sunday out of the fourth chapter of Nehemiah. And so as we always do, and I'm going to say it for the second time, if you didn't catch the message, go back and catch the message. We'll wait. We're not going anywhere. It's a little chilly in this room today, so we might leave sooner than usual, but we'll wait for you to go catch that. But might give us sort of the highlight version of what you're probably going to say on Sunday. And then we'll figure out how to take it even further. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, what we talked about is the fact that, you know, Nehemiah for Nehemiah kind of, it's not introduced, it's not introducing us to the enemies of Sanbalat and Tobiah. We were introduced earlier in the story of Nehemiah and them building the wall. But Sanbalat and Tobiah start to, they start to raise it up a notch. They start to first lobby over some insults. They essentially make fun. They belittle the Israelite people in their attempts. And we don't know how those insults made their way over to the Jewish camp, but they did. And what we essentially talked about on Sunday is the fact that when you are trying to build for something greater, you don't get to do it in peace for very long. And we all want to do it in peace. We just want to quietly go about building the thing. But God seems to not choose to have it operate that way very much. And so when the enemy does come, in their case, it was Sanbalat and Tobiah. But in our case, the enemy is the enemy. And when the enemy starts to come after us, the enemy often chooses to come after our identity and the places of fear in our hearts. And while the difficult things that we go through, that's one thing. Many of us, oftentimes we suffer more than we actually have to when we're going through difficult things because we listen to the lies of the enemy. And what Nehemiah did, his response told us a whole lot about where his heart and how his heart had been protected and prepared for this moment of conflict with the enemies, Tobiah and Sanbalat. Like what Nehemiah's response was, was he saw their insults as mockery, as them mocking him and the Israelite people, not as them exposing Nehemiah and the Israelite people, but them mocking him. And that tells us everything we need to know about where Nehemiah's heart was. Because if somebody mocks you, they're being immature. And if you call it mocking, you're just acknowledging, well, they're just lying and being immature. And so for many of us, the message is really simple. For a lot of us, we need our community to gather around us and help us identify the lies that the enemy is trying to speak to us when we are under attack so that even when things are difficult and even when we don't get to build in peace, the thing that is being built regardless is our heart because it's protected because we are operating in our identity given to us by God through Jesus Christ. So if you can't tell from that two minute summary, you need to go check out the Sunday message. But as we always do on this platform, we take whatever was said on Sunday and try to figure out how to make it as applicable as possible to our life. And so one of the things that I was struck by as I was looking over your notes for what you're probably going to say on Sunday is that it's so ready-made for practicality, right? That this is how you live. You look at the example of Nehemiah and what you drew out of it of being able to clearly distinguish between being exposed for the truth of who you are and that truth being kind of ugly or not what you had hoped and recognizing the criticism of the enemy for what it is, which is mockery. That this isn't true. It's a distraction, going back to Brian's point from week three. But it begs the question then, and this is where we're going to spend the bulk of our time today, is asking the same question about the three different places that you walked us through in your message. How do you do that? How do you do that? How did you start doing that? How did I start doing that? Not because we're necessarily experts, but because we've tried to do this. And sometimes it's helpful to have the principle fleshed out in real life. Not so that you then go follow that path exactly, but so that you start to see a path laid out of this is what it could look like. And that helps me sometimes figure out what it should look like for me. So, Mike, one of the first things you fleshed out was, Nehemiah seemed to be aware, and the Jewish people seemed to be aware to some degree of the possibility of where these accusations could land. And you laid out some examples of just, you know, present day of the things that people could say, whether it's family members or employers or fellow employees, of the things that they say and the way it gets translated in your heart. You're worthless. You're good for nothing. We don't value you. You're not important. Just be gone. How did you start to identify those core phrases and beliefs in your heart? How do we start to identify those so that we recognize them for what they are? Yeah, I'll say this, you know, I don't think that my journey is prescriptive, but I do think that it has been my journey. And I think some of them are probably things that we could all lean into. One of the things that has been and is continuing to be super helpful for me is removing the phrase but from my vocabulary. When it comes to when I read scripture or when I'm hearing from God, if I just remove the phrase but, then that helps me to stop putting up the kinds of barriers that prevent me from recovering from and healing from these negative core beliefs. So for instance, when I was a teenager, one of the first instances in my life where a kind of core belief or a core habit that I had built up was torn down and replaced with something more encouraging and helpful and gospel-oriented was that I used to very frequently make fun of people. And the core belief there was kind of like, I have to protect me, right? And so if I'm on the offensive making fun of them, then they're not making fun of me. And that was kind of the core belief there. And one of the things that I read in scripture that started to reorient that is I just, it was like I was reading it for the first time, Ephesians 429, of let no corrupting talk come out of your mouth, but only that which is helpful building up, you know, as fits the occasion and it gives grace to those who hear it. And I read that and there was a moment where I read it and all the times before when I had read it, it was, yeah, yeah, yeah, but I'm just joking. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but they know that I'm just kidding around. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but, you know, I have to protect me. When I removed but, all of a sudden it was like, oh, my story's not unique. Like when God speaks, he's speaking to me too. When he says, this is who you are and this is where you ought to live from, he's speaking to me too. And when I removed the but, I found that that was one of the ways, one of the steps that I needed to take and continue to need to take to like heal from my negative core beliefs and begin to embrace the gospel as the gospel truth as my personal truth, to use a millennial and Gen Z phrase. So for me, that is one of the ways it's been really, really helpful and it actually ties into the message too because, you know, one of the things that we said at the top is that even though all of our lives are difficult and we all have our things, your life is probably not uniquely difficult. Probably not. There are some people like, wow, oh, my gosh, you've been through so much. But most of our lives are not uniquely difficult. And so, and in the same way, we all, all of us have our excuses and all of us have our context as to why we are the way we are and why we believe what we believe. But we probably don't have unique reasons for that. Things that God has not considered before. And so for that reason, we should feel safe removing the but. So for me, that's been one of the things that has been helpful. I'm curious what comes to mind for you as well. Yeah, that's really good. Remove the but. One of the things that I find just so fascinating about the way that God chose to reveal himself through the scriptures is it's very, very rare. In fact, I can't think of many instances where you get the full glimpse of someone's life start to finish. Maybe Moses, kind of David, Nehemiah, we don't know his backstory. We don't know his origin story. We don't know what he grew up facing. We don't know the trials. We don't know the woundings. We don't, we don't know the things that probably felt most true to him because of life experience. What we do know is he seems to have cultivated a prayer life with God that shaped his heart so that he was prepared then for what God wanted to shape through him. So that's the thing for me that I've had to, I've had to learn to do is one, stop comparing myself to the people around me whose backstory I don't know, who look like they've got it all together, who seem like they're not struggling. It would be really easy to look at Nehemiah in the absence of greater context and go, well, this is apparently just a guy that didn't have it as hard as me. So I can't have the life that Nehemiah had because he didn't have to go through what I did. Everybody's got a story, everybody's got a past, everybody's got hardship and heartache and trauma. And so one of the things that I've had to then learn after the first thing of stop comparing myself is to invite God into my backstory and invite him to show me the things that I completely missed, the things that I was blissfully unaware of that were taking root in my heart that were not of God. You know, the messages that my life shaped around my heart, and I've, I've mentioned several of them over the course of months and now a couple of years on this platform of, you know, because of all the moving around in my life, I began to feel that disconnection from people is normal. And this is probably just how most people live. Most people live with very few true deep relational connections. So everybody's probably like, you know, plus or minus two on this. And then as, as events, you know, took place in my life, still, I was fairly young, starting to feel like, you know what, this is all up to me. I have to be the most responsible, not just playing to the archetype of oldest sibling, you know, firstborn. But there were events in my life that were shaping the perspective of, I have to be in charge. I have to be responsible. I have to be mature. I have to be prepared. I have to, I have to think my way through stuff so that there's no surprises, so that I don't make mistakes, so that I don't fail because failure is not allowed. And those weren't necessarily words that anybody told me. It was just what I perceived to be the reality of my life. And so just like you were bringing out in your message about, there were legitimate experiential moments throughout the history of the Jewish people that could have very easily confirmed the reality, you are less than. You are not valued. You are not safe. You are not wanted. That message came through loud and clear through any number of moments in their history. And yet Nehemiah seems to have cultivated a relationship with God to the point where those accusations aren't able to take root in the same way. He doesn't seem to be burdened by that feeling of, I'm worthless. I'm not wanted. I am abandoned. I am rejected. I am alone. He seems to know who he is because he's invited God into that space. And so I think for me, that's, again, it's the second tagline of this show. It's ask God. This isn't for you to figure out on your own. But even like you were talking about, Mike, with that verse from Ephesians, that's insight that you had that in some ways wasn't insight you could have had on your own unless God starts twisting some wires in your head and going, hey, the way you used to think, I want to show you a different way to think. Do you see how this is more real than the way you used to think? Huh. I hadn't realized that. There is no other way. And this is like we talked about last week when Lee was here. This is the life with God that God's inviting us into that he wants to have with us. It's to live every moment of our life with him and not just what to do and where to go. But God, who am I and who are you? Is there anything else that you found helpful? Because it's probably not a one-time thing, right? To discover these seeming truths that have taken root. What does that look like to live that out over time? Yeah, something else with that and then I'll transition to the second thing for me. But like you mentioned, we each have a story and it's just so tough because to some extent you're supposed to recognize how your story has shaped you. That's normal. That's good. That's healthy to have your story shape you. What you go through shapes you. It's nature and nurture. It's just the way that human beings operate. And so of course your nurture has shaped you. Of course your nurture has partly contributed to who you are. But I think the difference is that there is your story, what has happened in your life, and then there's your interpretation of your story. And for a lot of us, we've made those the same thing. That your interpretation of your story is your story and that's not true. That's what a relationship with God breaks us of. That's where freedom comes in in our relationship with Jesus Christ. We gain a new interpretation of our story and so then we have our story and that can still shape us and mold us, but then on top of that we get a clearer interpretation of our story so that we can become healthier people, the people that God has created us to be. And so we still wind up being individuals who are shaped by things that happen in our story, but we become the healthiest version of those individuals because our interpretation of our story is not the same thing as our story. And in order to get there, we have to do what you said, which is to ask God, which is something that a lot of us seem a little hesitant to do. The second thing that has really helped me to identify some of the core beliefs and phrases in my heart has, yes, ask God, but also ask the people around me. Ask my community. There have been, on a number of different occasions, you and the people like you in my life have pointed things out about me that feel really normal to me and they're not, you know? And if you don't have people in your life who can point things out about you, not in a critical way, but just in a, hey, are you aware that you operate this way, right? And just to have people who can share that and then you kind of, you know, in my natural instinct is always, there's nothing wrong with that back off. And then you take some time to think about it and to talk with God about it and you kind of come to a place where you go, oh, maybe that's not normal. Maybe that's not, not just is it not normal, but maybe it's not healthy. And so that has been a second and super helpful way for me to identify some core beliefs that are negative, that are unhelpful, that are destructive, has been to ask or at least be open to receiving feedback from my community. Yeah. I really like that. And as you were talking about the, you know, the experience of your story and the interpretation of your story, it was making me think about how clearly I thought I saw myself and my story before God started showing me the reality of my story. Because I thought all those things that I just shared a couple minutes ago, I thought the correct interpretation of that was my story has made me strong. My story has made me resilient. My story has made me not need anyone. I am self-sufficient and look how great that is. Look how competent that has made me. I'm not going to have to rely on it. I have learned that I don't have to rely on anybody because that's what my life has showed me. How great is that? I thought that was all good. Those are good things. Those are good things, right? And there are elements of those that are beneficial, but man, did I just double down on that is the reality of my story and those are without equivocation, good things. There's no gray area. Those are all good things and everybody else should be like this too, by the way. And it wasn't until I started to do this thing that we're talking about of, God, help me see myself clearly. I'm pretty sure I see myself clearly, but you may have a couple of things to say. And the dude just wrecked me and started to show me that while I thought I was self-sufficient, that self-sufficiency wasn't the goal. You go back to Lee's message from last week. I was missing out on so many opportunities for something greater because I had purposely and intentionally believed I'm supposed to be able to do it on my own. And if I can't, then there's something wrong with me. My story was in need of massive reinterpretation. I just thought it was normal. And not only did I think it was normal, I thought it was good. And we are not alone in that. And in this issue of identity, which is really what this is, seeing myself and my story clearly, you see that we're not alone in this. And this is a bit of a soapbox moment for me. I'm going to try to keep it brief. And if I go too long, just give me the hook. But this is Gideon in Judges 6. The Lord shows up and says, mighty man of valor, the Lord is with you. And Gideon tells him he's wrong. He tells the Lord, no, I see myself clearly. And what's true about me is I am the least of my family, which is the least of my clan, which is the least of my tribe. And oh, by the way, the Lord has abandoned us. These are the things I know to be true because my story tells me so. It's arguing with God about what's most true about himself and God. Jesus tells Peter, he's a rock, 30 seconds before he then has to remind Peter, you don't always see things clearly. I do have to go to the cross. Get behind me, Satan. I'm not saying you are Satan. I'm saying you still have parts of you that aren't seeing clearly. This is the truth for most every notable person in scripture whose story we get at least a larger glimpse of is they think they see clearly. We think we see clearly. And in many cases, the God of the universe himself may be showing up in our life through the scriptures, through his voice in our heart, through the people he's put into our life saying, hey, there may be some things you're not seeing clearly. And our response is, I'm pretty sure you're wrong. I'm pretty sure I know best about me. And so one of the other things that's super helpful in this space is humility. The recognition that you do not see yourself clearly. None of us do. But if you're willing to look and if you're willing to let other people underneath the hood, God can do some amazing things. Anything else in this one before we move on, Mike? Those really are the, well, I don't know if we just mentioned two things, I feel like we might've mentioned 10, but in my head I counted two. But yeah, those are definitely in my story. Those have been the main things that have helped me identify the core phrases and beliefs that exist in my heart. The only thing I'll mention is that when we talk about identifying core beliefs and core phrases, I think I've had a pretty difficult time limiting some of those things to just one phrase, like figuring out what the phrase is. In fact, if you ask me today what a core destructive belief or phrase is in my heart, I might say one particular phrase. And then if you ask me three months from now, I might say the same basic idea, but I might phrase it differently. I don't know that it matters so much that the syntax is spot on and consistent. It's a core belief, not a core sentence. And so it can be a little bit difficult and a little bit tricky to quantify with words in the English language what a core belief is. But I think once you do identify it, even if you don't necessarily have all the verbiage for it perfectly, I think you can start to walk the path toward allowing God and the gospel to heal those things. And so I just want to clarify that because I know some of us are concrete thinkers. And if we don't have the perfect sentence that we can write out in our journal every day, we feel lost. And I just want to let some of us off the hook with that because I know I'm that way. I'm like, where do I put the comma, though? Right. So I just want to let us off the hook with that. Nice. You put the comma where you take a breath. Everybody knows that. That's well, I do now. Sorry, that was for my wife, who is a loyal listener. I love you, sweetie. So I'm just going to need this. All right. So second question. Once we have a sense of what these core beliefs are at a heart level. And again, Proverbs tells us, as a man thinks in his heart, so is he. What we're after is the deeper reality. We have intellectual head knowledge. I know the Lord is faithful. I know he will never abandon me or forsake me. But man, there's just something in my heart that feels like when push comes to shove, God's not going to show up and it's up to me. Right. That that is a core belief. That is a heart level belief. And that's not an abstract one. That's one I have. Right. There's there's things like, you know, I know I know people have told me they love me, but there's a place in my heart that feels like. But I feel like people leave. And that just feels like reality. Right. And I know in my head what they've said, I know in my head what the scriptures have said. I know what the scriptures have said about I am chosen and I am beloved by God. But then there's a piece of me that feels like, man, you better not screw up. You better not. You are not allowed to make mistakes because if you make mistakes. People are going to leave or there's going to be significant consequences. You cannot fail. That's a core belief. And so the second area for us to really take this deeper is once you've started to identify some of these phrases, some of these core beliefs that maybe you can't always put the same words to, but you feel like there's a reality there. How do you cultivate a heart like Nehemiah's where you can recognize attacks from the enemy as mockery instead of confirmation of truth? Where you respond, and I love this phrase that you used, where you respond, God come close because the enemy is being childish again instead of either trying to defend yourself or embracing that belief yet again. How did you start to do that? Yeah. Here's what I'll say. I'll open by just saying this is an incredibly important question because if we don't honestly try to work through the true answer to this question, we will just end up being, we'll end up faking it till we make it, which is one of the most commonly used pet peeve phrases in and outside of the church. We will end up simply being delusional, acting like we, acting like we believe something that we don't actually believe will be fake. And so I think our answer to this question matters a lot. So for me, and again, I want to start with my story because it's a lot easier to start with. Here's how it worked in my life. And then from there we can maybe start to tease out what it might look like in someone else's life. But I guess so in the areas of my heart that have been transformed and or are being transformed. And that certainly is not all of the areas of my heart yet. The way that it has worked is it really has had a lot to do with this, this big churchy loaded word repentance. It has been this incredibly, it's been this huge journey for me learning what that word means because when I was a kid, that word basically just means telling God I'm sorry. And it's filled with, it was emotionally loaded with a lot of shame that there needs to be tearing of sackcloth and weeping and ashes. That's the idea of repentance. And some of that imagery is, of course, biblical. So so it makes sense. But then, you know, because we're human and because I was a kid when I was being introduced to the ideas, I think in some ways some of that got distorted. And and so repentance became this this thing that I, man, I don't want to do that. That sounds, I don't want to feel sad. And, you know, and and on the other side of that, the tough thing about using this word repentance is that for many of us, I don't feel like I should have to apologize to God for stuff that he let happen in my story. I have to apologize because I came out of my story believing that I don't need anybody. The reason I believe that is because of stuff he allowed to happen in my story. Why should I apologize to God for believing that? If he wouldn't have let it happen, he'd have just been the way that God should be and not let the hard things happen in the first. So so this word repentance is, I think, very, very loaded. But I think it's had a lot for me gaining a proper understanding of it and then coming to a place of repenting over the lies that I've believed has been a really, really key part in cultivating a heart like Nehemiah's. Yeah. I really appreciate the way you just talked about repentance. It's so honest, and I think I hope that that resonates with most people as they hear that because there really is no other way. Because in some way, shape or form, and it's this pesky thing that God gave us called free will. We are allowed at a heart level to decide what we think is true, whether we've consciously chosen it or not. And like you said, and a lot of these things that we've come to believe are true happen long before we were so much more sophisticated and intellectually developed. It came through the reality of lived experience at a time when we had a very simplified view of life. And you look at the way that kids view the world and it's pretty stark. It's it's black and white. It's this is true and this is not. And I wanted candy for breakfast because it's right after Halloween and you wouldn't give it to me. And so it means you don't love me. Oh, you you were. I didn't know you were there this morning in our kitchen. Yeah. Right. There are things that we have believed to be true and then continued to live out of that we have doubled down on. We had talked about this a little over a year ago now. Actually, it might have been right about this time last year. We talked about the idea of strongholds. Second Corinthians 10, Paul talks about that, that God has given us weapons to tear down strongholds. And in typical human fashion, we've completely misunderstood what strongholds are. We've just thought strongholds are bad behaviors, the things that we're supposed to throw on sackcloth and ashes for and beat ourselves into the ground before God does it first and show him how sorry we are before he ruins the rest of our life by allowing more things to come in. And that's not it. That when you look at the language of that verse, it goes on to talk about that we tear down strongholds. By tearing down arguments and lofty opinions that raise themselves up against the knowledge of God, that our strongholds aren't the things we do, they're the things we believe that are in opposition to. They are arguments and opinions that have raised themselves up to equal level. With what God knows to be true, it's Gideon in the hole. God says, you're a mighty man of valor and I am with you. And Gideon has an argument and a lofty opinion shaped by a lifetime of experience that says you are wrong. What I know to be true is as valid or more than whatever you might be saying, God. The only way out of that is repentance, and again, that's not sackcloth and ashes per se. But it does require a level of grieving in the heart of, I didn't realize I had believed that all these years. And you sort of pause and you look around at the damage that that has wrought. And that would probably push you to grieving. That would probably push you to sadness. And there's nothing wrong with that. There's nothing wrong with that at all to take a look at not what God has done or even what you have done, but what the enemy has stolen. What the enemy has manipulated you into believing that for your part, you bit down on. It's what the serpent did in the garden with Adam and Eve. Doesn't that fruit look tasty? It won't kill you. It'll make you wise. It'll make you like God. Right. He tempted, he distorted, he deceived. But they bit down. Right. We have a part to own in this. Yeah. We had a choice, however informed or not informed we may have been, and we made it. And so that part is something that, and again, we don't have to beat ourselves up, but we have to recognize, you're right, God. I've been believing that a long time. Yeah. Yeah. And it's this thing when we talk about it, because again, you know, we're going to talk about what the actual, because right now we're talking a lot about what it isn't. I think it's important, though, that we're doing that. And so, you know, in leading us down the path of what repentance is, I want to frame it up this way. I think most of us, you know, there's the thing that happens to us in life and we wonder why the things happen. And while God may not answer that question for every individual circumstance, God has, in a few different ways in scripture, answered the question why things happen that are difficult, why we go through difficult circumstances. And my favorite way that that's eloquated in scripture, and I think it speaks a lot to what we're talking about with why we need to repent, is Romans 8, 28 and 29, in which Paul says, we know that all things work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose. And most of us stop reading there because that's a really good, nice, encouraging verse. But the next verse, 29, starts with for, which means whenever we see a, which is therefore, and whenever we see a therefore, we should figure out what therefore is therefore. And so we back up and we go back to verse 28. Oh, he's saying because of verse 28, God works all things together for, because God, those whom God foreknew, he called to become more like the firstborn son, Jesus. And when you put that entire two verse section together, it's no matter what you go through in life, God is using that. God wants to use that to make you more like Jesus. In the problem, the reason that we need to repent is not because it's not because it was so evil. We're evil for being victims of what happened to us. No, no. The things that you've been through in life, God's intention in allowing some of those things to happen was that you would be made more like Jesus. But instead of becoming more like Jesus through the difficult things we go through, we often bite into the apple and we feed into the lies of the enemy. And so the pain that we go through is not weaponized against the enemy like it's supposed to be. We're not made more like Jesus through our pain like we are supposed to be. Instead, we go in the opposite direction. And so what repentance is when it comes to it, it's acknowledging before God that his intent in allowing us to go through some of the things we've gone through, that we haven't taken that path, that path of having our pain redeemed for our benefit and for others benefit around us and for God's glory. We haven't used our pain for that purpose. Then instead, we've gone the path of buying into the lies that the enemy is feeding us. And so because we've chosen this, instead of choosing that, we need to address this before God and own our part. And that's where, while we start talking about this word repentance. Yeah, and that reminds me when in Luke 4, when Jesus steps into the temple and he's handed the scroll of Isaiah and he unrolls it and starts to read that one of the things that Isaiah said the Messiah would come to do is bind up the brokenhearted. Right there, there is pain in your past. There are painful words that were said or that that were never said and therefore caused pain in their absence. And so Mike, as you were pointing out on Sunday in your message, how do we get to the point where our response is God come close? The enemy is being childish again, is the recognition that one God wants to come close. That's his desire. He's not waiting for you to figure this out on your own, right? He's not inside watching you play outside, getting just trucked by mean kids and going, well, he's got to figure it out someday. Right. God's desire is to come close. Right. Jesus tells the story of a father with two sons and there was a son who finally realized he was living a lie, that he was believing things about himself and his father that weren't true. And he turned and came home. And before he even got to the house, dad ran out to him. It's God's desire to come close. And so when we feel like the enemy is mocking us or when we feel like the enemy is saying things that might actually be true and we're not sure. The very first response is recognizing in this moment, God wants to come close. That's his desire. And then the second part is God come close. The enemy's being childish again is the same thing that you would do as a child. If somebody else's child or somebody's child that you're related to happens to be acting childishly is you go to mom and dad, not only for comfort, but also for truth. Right. My, my brother, my sister, the neighbor said this and your heavenly father, whatever your parents were like, your heavenly father desires to tell you what's true, to remind you what's true that he may have already told you, or perhaps for the first time to show you yet another facet of yourself that you haven't seen clearly yet. And so again, in my case, the times where I've felt like the truest thing about me as I'm all alone. That's been a place that God has spoken to again and again and again. And so of course that's still a tender spot. And that's a place where the enemy continues to mock, to convince me that in my marriage, in my work, in my friendships, I'm still alone. And so that's a place that I've had to cultivate the discipline, much like we see Nehemiah model of God come close. These accusations are coming again and they're hitting a sensitive spot. I'm not just supposed to be able to brush it off. God, can you remind me again of what's true? And God's not an impatient teacher who goes, I can't believe you haven't learned this lesson yet. He's a loving father who desires to remind his children every waking moment of who they are and who he is. Yeah. Yeah. And so when we turn, when we turn from those negative core beliefs, I think what you're poking at is really important that when we turn from away from our negative core beliefs, which is sometimes the simple definition that we'll often use around here for repentance is turning away from turning and walking away from a certain belief in that we just choose to go not anymore. No, thank you. And we'll just walk away from that. And so when we, even when we do that, that even when we do that, the enemy's a jerk and it often comes back. And in that, when that, when that happens, we need not be surprised that it's coming back and we need not be discouraged that it's coming back because this is the way that the enemy likes to work. He's not particularly, he's extraordinarily smart but he's not a creator. He doesn't create new wounds. He just pokes at the ones that he knows have always been there and he'll find new ways to do that. But it's usually the same old stuff in a way. And so I think that's really important that we talk about that. And that when we invite God to come close, what we're doing is we are choosing to not just sit in the pig pen, eating the slop. And in the case, I think most of us don't think about this when it comes to our own stories, because in the case of the prodigal son, we're always very conscientious of the fact that the prodigal son is the one who did that to himself. At least that's the way a lot of us interpret his story is, oh, well, he did that to himself. So when he was sitting in the pig pen, well, he deserved that. And, and for most of us, when we are sitting in the slop and in the dirt and the mire, we don't feel like we've deserved that or done anything to earn that. And in many cases, that's true. Like you just had things happen to you that were completely outside of your control. But nevertheless, the second half of the prodigal son story is still true of many of us that we kind of act two before we get to act three, act two was still very true of us that we sit in the pig pen and we just sit there and we're just miserable. And it's just what we know. It's just our new normal. And we just settle in and we just go, this is the best I can do right now. And it just seems to take us so long to get to act three, where we invite the father in back or back in. And so what we're saying when we talk about how do we cultivate a heart like Nehemiah is, is we're just saying, let's look to be people who lessen the length of time that we sit in the slop. Let's be people who first and foremost, identify that we're in slop a little bit quicker every time. And then let's be people who sit there for a shortened period of time before we invite God in to help address whatever lies we're believing and to clean us up so that we can go and feast and party. Yeah, that'll preach right there. So last one, and I feel like this could be its own podcast. So we're not going to do justice to this topic in whole, but one of the last things you brought out in your message, Mike, was the difference between in these moments of crisis, in these moments where it feels like the accusations are coming in hot and heavy. And you talked, you know, pretty personally about the stuff that's been going on in your life lately that has required the help of the people around you. You talked about the shift from just having good friends to having biblical community. And you were talking about that good friends are really good. Having the people that come and bring you food or bring you distraction or whatever the thing is that good friends do is good. But you were saying there's something that your biblical community can offer that is just beyond what good friends do. And it was that your biblical community rushes to you and invites God's spirit into you to heal and protect your heart, to not just medicate or distract, but to actually transform. And so it begs a question that, again, we could spend far more time on, but I'm curious about your initial thoughts. How did you shift from just having good friends to having that kind of biblical community? Yeah. And this is, if I could just, again, this is like my favorite thing you do. If I could just raise the tension on this, if I can just make us all cringe real quick with the reality of this and why this is so difficult. There is, I think most of us have a hard time admitting this, but there is something very intimate about experiencing God with other people. It's weird. It's why, you know, I'm in youth ministry, right? It's why teenagers and even adults oftentimes are so hesitant to pray out loud, right? There's something about your relationship with God, and it's so personal, and it's this place of, I think for a lot of us, it's this place of feelings of insufficiency. We don't quite feel like we're there yet. We don't feel like we're as far along as we should be in our relationship with God, and we don't want other people to see that. And so for some of us, that's the reason that our church friends are good friends, but they haven't quite crossed the threshold with us of being our true, the place where we experience transformational relationships. It's because we're so hesitant to bring God into these God-centered relationships. It's like we have different friend groups, and you've got your friend group that you go cycling with, or you do pickleball with. Pickleball? What is pickleball? So, you know, you got these friends that you do all these different interests and hobbies with, right? And then there's a friend group, and the interest or hobby is like God stuff, but it isn't actually God. It isn't experiencing God. It's an interest group. It's a friend group where we interact about the things of God, but we don't experience God together. And so super high level, if I had to define the difference, it's going from having a friend group where our interest group is, oh, yeah, we go to a tennis court, or I don't know where you do it, and you play pickleball, and then we stand in a circle, and we talk about the Bible, and we talk about the things of God. It's going from that group to going, these are the people that I go to God with, right? And I think that is a threshold that many of us have yet to cross because our relationship with God is still a place of vulnerability and insecurity for us. I feel like this was one of those things that I thought I knew, and then I kept discovering I didn't know. And then I learned more and experienced more, and I thought, okay, this is what it is. And then just by the time I felt like, oh, this is what it is, I discovered, oh, there's even more. And so it's a little hard to just pin this down and objectively describe it as, all right, this is the target. Everybody start marching in that direction. But it is the recognition that there is a depth of being known that is mandatory. There is a depth of your story being known by the people around you, the places where you struggle. And this isn't just like they have to know all of your sin patterns. It's the places that you believe at a heart level are true about yourself, right? It's not just the, I struggle with this particular outward behavior. It's, this is the internal belief that drives my unhealthy behaviors, right? Because I feel like I'm always going to be left alone. I don't reach out and I'm not good on text messages and I rarely plan social gatherings, right? Some of that, sure, maybe that's temperament, but some of that's me living out of the belief that, man, people are going to leave anyway, so why am I going to bother? And until I let people in to see that, until I let them see the man behind the curtain, I haven't yet gotten to the place of biblical community. And then until I allow them to say, hey, that's the man behind the curtain talking, that's not true. I haven't arrived to biblical community. And until we both get to the place where they say, you know, John, this seems like it's a pattern of behavior in our relationship that we keep trying to get close. And it seems like you just keep giving us the Heisman stiff arm. Can we pray about this and not just like pray over you and pray that God would whoosh it away, but can we pray into this? Can we sit here with you for as long as it may take over time and invite God to both show us how to love you better, but invite God to show you how to let us love you better. That's fundamentally different than the really good friends that when things are hard, bring you a meal and come over with a bottle of wine and just hang out for the night and distract you from the things that are going on. You need those people. And you need the people that are willing to press in to those deepest, darkest places and bring the transformational power of God that can only be accessed through God and through those that walk with him. And that's intimidating. Oh my God. As we're describing it, I'm like, how many of those people even exist who have not only the desire, but then on top of that, I don't know if it's a skill set or the depth or the understanding how to do that when we describe what we're talking about this. But I think that that's good. I think that that's good because life is long. I think that that's good because it gives us something to shoot for. It raises the bar. And I think when we start to shoot for relationships like that where you are fully known and where you are pursuing God's presence together as it relates to your story and to their story, when we pursue that, I think that a lot of the barriers to community and a lot of the drama that comes with church world, which is mostly just a result of people being fake and being afraid to get to this place together. And that's why we're always fighting all the time is because people are being fake and their pride's getting in the way and all that kind of stuff. So if we would just shoot for that together, even if we have a hard time quite figuring out how to get the X's and O's of it, I do think a lot of the other stuff that's holding us back from community, I think a lot of that stuff's going to melt away because we're going to experience something that's a lot more genuine and we're going to experience something that's a lot more transformed. Even if not every single heart level thing is melted away by our tribe and us going to the Lord together with our tribe, I do think that we're going to start to see some stuff melt away in us and we're going to go, oh, and then there's going to be more. And then again, that surface-y level, well, I don't like them because they bragged about their new car the other day and who do they think they are? That church drama nonsense, that's going to melt away because we're getting after something deeper than that. And so I would say that those things are extraordinarily, extraordinarily helpful. In my life, I know that getting there has been really difficult because you and I have some of the same core destructive beliefs and mine is very much like, I don't need you. That's a really big core belief for me, that I don't need you and that you is in response to everybody in the world. And so, in fact, my mom was having this conversation with me like last week of like, hey, I know that you don't really need people like that. And I'm like, my mom's out here calling out my core beliefs. And so in order to get there, I think it really has required me to have some friends who, yes, they're good friends, but what I've discovered over about the past week and a half is sometimes those good friends, when the Sanbalats and the Tobias and the building the wall and there's enemies marching against your wall and you're having to, when the crap hits the fan in your life and you're going through something really hard, sometimes that's the catalyst, if you'll allow it to be. That's the catalyst for good friends becoming this, transforming into this place where you experience transformational relationships. And so again, it's this, everything that God allows you to go through is intended to make you become more like Jesus, to transform you into becoming more like Jesus. But we have to recognize those opportunities when they're brought to us and we have to ignore some core, get rid of some core beliefs and allow some people in so that we can experience something that's redemptive out of the overflow of our pain. Yeah. Yeah. I hope you stuck with us to the end because, man, there was some good stuff there for me at the end. So I hope there was some good stuff there for you as well. So friends, thanks for being on this journey with us. Thank you for pressing in to something greater. Thank you for fighting for something greater. Thank you for continuing to believe that God has more for us because he does. So Mike, thank you, man. This was a pleasure. Yeah. It was a good time. Yeah. And we'll see you all next time.
