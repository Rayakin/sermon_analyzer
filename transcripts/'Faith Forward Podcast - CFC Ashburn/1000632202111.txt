I want to just hop in real quick. First, you said we can't even do with God. And the implication is that He wants us to be better together, which led me to the second thing. For some of us, one of the biggest discomforts of Nehemiah is going to be I can't do this alone. Yeah. And that's, by the way, a big step to go from I can't do this alone to I have to do this with Jesus. It's another big step to say I can't do this alone with Jesus because that brings up a whole other set of concerns, distractions, sin patterns, you know, strongholds. There's a whole list of things we could say that we might be struggling with that God wants to break through and grow us on. Yeah, I'm okay with me being a messy person, but other messy people is just messy. I'm okay with my sin. Your sin. That's too much. Yeah. Too much. So week three, if you haven't seen the message yet, go check that out. Then come back. But in this third week, we're now getting into Nehemiah beginning to take action and some of the lessons that we can take away once we've rooted ourself in we need to be aware of the desires God's placed in us. Yeah. It's going to require a greater relational connection to engage in something greater with God. It's going to require risk and discomfort. So tell us where we're going today. Well, yeah, one of the challenges that I brought up is that often, like, we step out in this risk finally. We're like, all right, I'm going to step out of the risk. We have a greater prayer life and that sort of stuff. That sounded bad, but you know what I'm saying. Greater prayer life, greater risk. We won't edit that out of the podcast because we never edit it. But nonetheless, I was trying to drive to the point that I have experienced this in my own life, and I've been around a lot of people as well who just, boom, I've stepped out. But they lack lived experience in those types of stepping out in the moment. So they don't know actually how to live it out. What's really good about Nehemiah 2, verses 9 to 16, it's this intermediate period where he's left the citadel of Susa. He's traveled the 900 miles, and now he's in Jerusalem, and he's there for three days. And from an outward perspective that anybody else would know, they have no clue what he's doing. He shows up. People clearly had to know he's a person of power and purpose, but he hasn't told anyone what the purpose is. It's very clear in the text. What is he doing in these three days? And I think he illustrates for us a manner of what it looks like, how to live out when we step out, to use those terms, some of the things that we might struggle with. And so it started with this idea that when he went there that the king actually gave him officers and protection. We don't know what's implied in Nehemiah's ask for paperwork, but that's all that he asked. But there's nowhere that we seem to see that he verbally asked for an armed guard. By the way, he got one. And so when he showed up, it showed that he was protected and he was a person of power. And I just took this moment to turn, like, if a king knew that someone was going in his name, he's going to provide that they're going in his name. How much more for the king of kings and the Lord of lords, Jesus, who doesn't call us a cupbearer, who calls us son or daughter of him. Where he goes, he is going to provide. And so I think inside of us, when we begin to understand that he's calling us into something greater, one of the initial fears is, well, what if this doesn't work? And I'm not saying work the way we want it to work, but the idea of what if we feel like God leaves us hanging out to dry. Because, John, using something I said last week, risk is often from the perspective of the person looking. There's a whole lot of things that you've done that make me uncomfortable for your risk, right? And for you, it may or may not have. But the good thing is that we know every time you've stepped out to it, God provides. He will. Sometimes slower than we might want. And so, number one, that. Then the second and third thing I wanted people to think about as they step out. Number one, hey, God is going to provide. You've got to have confidence in that and living out. Is be aware of two dangers. One of distraction and one of this idea of disorder. And we'll spend some time talking about both of those today and knowing the enemy schemes. Because we're introducing the latter half of Nehemiah chapter 2 of what I would say to be two of the main antagonists. Sanballat and Tobiah. Sanballat was technically known as a satrap. That means he was a ruler of a region. We don't know specifically what it meant Nehemiah showing up if all of a sudden Sanballat lost some power because Nehemiah was given power. It's kind of unclear. But he was clearly a ruler. Tobiah has some Jewishness in his background. It's kind of unclear. But he worked for him. He was one of his main guys. And over and over and over again throughout the book of Nehemiah, they're going to come back and their desire for the people of God was different than God's desire for the people of God. So they're going to be very creative, sometimes very threatening, sometimes very flattering. But the goal the whole time is to keep them from accomplishing what God wants. So we've got to be aware of the danger of distraction because we have an enemy that's real on top of our own sort of, you know, missiological ADD, so to speak sometimes. And he's out there trying to get us off. And lots of times those distractions don't look like bad things, but they're not God things in the moment. And then the danger of disorder, getting ahead of God, you know, having this just not be the way. And we'll talk about the spirit of wisdom and the spirit of revelation because I think there's a tension lots of times. I know in my own life, well, do I need to talk to God because it gave me a brain? Or, well, I should always talk to God and I don't use the brain that he's given me. How does that work? How do we begin to understand for whom much is given, much is required, which was given after the parable Jesus did in Luke of the parable of the talents. And the parable of the talents is not just about money. It does apply to money, but it means that God has given people things and there's an expectation that we are stewards of what he's given. Our intellect and our intelligence and our experience are things that he's given us. So that's a very tactical backup to the conversation we had on Sunday. Yeah, that's a good place to start. So as we shift now to as eminently practical as we know how to make this, I want to start with just sort of a preface, partially because I love a good preface, but also because when we're talking about for something greater, when we're talking about greater risk, I think there's a tendency sometimes to want to make that an objective standard. That, you know, these are things that qualify as for something greater and these are things that don't. And for those that are doing the audio only, really big hands, really small hands. Yeah. This is greater risk and this is smaller risk. And so going back to the parable of the talents, Jesus' invitation to all of us is to be faithful in the small things and then be invited into more. And so wherever God is inviting you into something greater, that's where you start with the practical application. This isn't JV and then varsity. This isn't minor leagues and then the big leagues. Anything that stretches us, anything that results in our growth, is us stepping into something greater than we can do on our own. And in many cases, something greater than we can do on our own with God. And it involves a risk. And so avoid the temptation, avoid the trap, avoid the lie from the enemy that the things that God's inviting you into really aren't all that greater, really don't involve that much more risk. Look at all these other things that other people are doing. It goes back to what I said last week. It doesn't matter what other people think about your risk tolerance. It doesn't matter even what I think about my risk tolerance, that's big or small. The question is, what has Jesus asked? And if Jesus has asked it, he's the one that's best designed to know what he needs to stretch us in. And so that's really the key. And that's very freeing. In the second part of the podcast, we see all the times, ask God. Go ask him, God, are you asking me to do this? And then don't worry about whether it seems like big risk or small risk. It's just he asked. Sometimes, in general, it doesn't ever happen. At first, it doesn't seem like a small risk. Then when I get in the middle of it, I'm like, oh, that kind of grew like a mushroom I didn't expect. And I think sometimes in my own life, God knows my heart. He doesn't fully reveal all the risk that's going to happen because he understands that he needs to faithfully move me along. Because if all of a sudden sometimes I knew everything up front, there's a much higher probability that I would want to run like Jonah on a boat to Tarsus. Absolutely. With that having been said, one of the first things you talked about on Sunday and one of the first places we want to start from a practical standpoint is this idea that God will provide for whatever the greater thing is that he's inviting us to. God will provide whether or not we can see it at this time. In Nehemiah's case, Nehemiah saw a lot of the provision up front. He asked for seemingly a little. Like you said, we don't know exactly what, but it seems like he only asked for paperwork and he got paperwork plus. And so from the outset, it seemed like Nehemiah had the very clear sense and confirmation of clearly the Lord is with me and he is providing. And sometimes that doesn't feel like the case for us. And so one of the first practical places for us to stop and take stock is am I waiting on my ability to see all of the provision before I start moving? Because God won't always show us the provision in advance. There's one time where God tells people to cross a body of water that he's going to part. And in one instance, he parts the water before anybody steps foot in it. And then in another instance, he says, put your foot in the water. And then I part it. God is not a process. He's a person. And so if God is asking us to do something, the promise is he will provide. Our hesitation sometimes is we either don't see it yet or we feel like it's not enough. God, I feel like you're providing, but I would like a level of comfort with this. I would like to have two times or three times or ten times what you're showing me you're providing because then I would have the confidence to go and do the thing. And so let that be sort of the first place. One, if you feel like God's inviting you into something greater, what is your heart level reaction to God's provision? Is it I'm not seeing it or I'm seeing it, but it doesn't feel like enough. So I think it's interesting whenever we read a text removed thousands of years. I think we can really easily read a lot into because we're looking back over all that happened. The truth is Nehemiah gained confidence, but he didn't know how God was going to provide when he asked. He didn't clearly ask for these sort of things. I mean, there's a chance that we don't know how long it was between when he asked and when he left. So there's a chance that he asked, got paperwork, and it was only later that he finds out he's going to have the armies with him to where he's going to have to travel 900 miles through people who didn't like him. And so I think we have to be careful sometimes because we know the end of the story of accidentally putting ourselves there. I think the other thing that you reminded me of and where we're doubting God is there's definitely in my life a prayer that I've been praying consistently over the years. By consistently, I mean at least once every three weeks or averaging once every three weeks. That's a better way to say it. And it's from Proverbs chapter 30, and I might encourage us to consider that when it talks about what it looks like to step out into something greater when we have this tension. And the writer of the Proverbs says, God, do not give me so little that I defame your name. Don't give me so much that I don't depend on you. I think it's an okay prayer to say, God, when you're calling me into something greater, God, could you give me enough to help my faith? But don't, here's the thing, don't give me so much that I don't have to go back to you. See, what happens in Nehemiah over and over again is not that he gets the whole plan. Yeah, he got there, but he's still going to have all kinds of things happening from the enemies, from without, and enemies from within, and just people, frankly, have been fine with the way it had been in one way or another for an amount of time. He has lots of other things where he's going to go back to God. And so maybe for us, we take confidence in the fact that God will provide, and we go to him with open hands because he knows our heart, and say, I'm struggling, God, could you give me enough to just take the next step, but not so much that I don't have to continue to walk with you. Saying that truthfully is not really how I want to work my life. I wish it was you give me everything, but I've learned when he gives me more than I need at the moment, my temptation to become self-sufficient, or in some cases try to do it on my own, or my own and with God, and not bringing other people in, it increases. So it's something to consider when you're praying in that moment. Yeah, you've used the phrase that his goal is always twofold, our good and his glory. And this story of Nehemiah, especially over the last few years, has made me think about this place that God has invited me to, to rebuild this house that we have. And it's not the walls of Jerusalem, but it's a significant undertaking that I can't do on my own, and I can't even do on my own with God. And there have definitely been times where I've felt, God, you haven't provided enough. You led me here to die. Not literally, but you led me here and then shortchanged me. And his response has always been, Have you ever not had enough? And often my response is, Yes, I have not had enough for what I want. Ah, yes. And therein lies the rub. If his goal is our good and his glory, sometimes I want his goal to be my comfort and his glory. Sure. And so like you said with Nehemiah, it's unclear, especially if we refrain from looking at it from the back end forward, that he didn't know, in some cases, if he had enough. He didn't know if he had enough protection navigating those 900 miles of hostile territory. When he gets there and he takes three days to review the site, I'm sure even with those letters of Mark essentially for lumber, there's going to be a thought of, are we going to have enough? Are we going to have enough people that will help? Are we going to have enough? Or God, did you lead me out here to die? It would have been, you know, God gives us what we need in Scripture. But man, I would have loved to know what his thoughts were in those three days because I think a lot of us are in the metaphorical three days. And in those three days where we find ourselves pausing, and I think, you know, just a side note, there's a lot of imagery in Scripture about three days, that there's a whole lot that the enemy could come in. And what I love about the fact is he saw the challenge in front of him, and you know there's spiritual warfare going on in the Old Testament just like the New Testament, and that the enemy didn't want God's glory to be given. There had to be some depressing moments. I mean, the place he can't even get his animal through the gate because there's so much rubble. Yeah, yeah, I mean, and so, and again, I mentioned this on Sunday, to put in perspective, this wasn't, you know, like, I don't know what we think about when we think about the walls. They were significant. It wasn't like we're building something, and this is a bad reference, across the border of the United States as a wall, but it was three miles, right? That's a lot. And it was three miles without heavy machinery. Yeah. It was three miles doing things really old, old school. It was a big thing, and I can imagine, if you've ever been in a scenario like this, you're not alone, because I have, where I feel called into something, and then I look at it, and this sense of overwhelming, like, how are we going to get through this? How all of this, but that he still stayed faithful and still went with God. That is completely nothing to do with what we're talking about, but maybe someday when I get to heaven, I'll have that conversation about the three days. Yeah, but I think that is a really helpful place to pause. In whatever the midst of the thing that God's inviting you into is the recognition that the days where you are taking stock of the situation, there's going to be a temptation to doubt God's provision, either that he's providing it all or that he's providing enough, and one of the enemy's probably foremost lies is God's holding out. I mean, that's one of the oldest lies that he's used, going all the way back to the garden, is that you can't trust the heart of God. God is someone who withholds and holds out, and if it's something that God's called you into, and if it's something that you feel a deep burden for and that you know that God is inviting you into, he will provide, and so be prepared for that deception to come in, that who God is is the one who doesn't. Who God is is the one who doesn't provide. Who God is is the one who doesn't come through. That's a really practical thing to prepare yourself for. It means you still have to go through it, but you're at least looking for it. So, you then on Sunday mentioned distractions and detours, that when we're stepping into this something greater with God and with others, that inevitably there's going to be distractions and detours, and it's important that we be able to discern the difference. So, talk a little bit about that. Well, hopefully I explained it well in a quick fashion on Sunday, is that one person's distraction can be another person's detour. One person's detour can be another person's distraction. In general, in the analogy that I used, distractions are bad, detours are part of a process where God is using something to a greater point. And one of the ways to better define this, I illustrate this with my father-in-law. My father-in-law, next to my wife, she gets it from him, is probably one of, if not the most relational human being I've ever met. Knows everybody, that sort of thing. And talk about a road trip on Sunday, he loves to stop at the side little diners, right? Here, I'm going to talk about, like, I know for a fact, I said this to you on a podcast, like when I go visit his house, if he says to me, Brian, I want to run an errand to get a newspaper, I kid you not, he doesn't have the newspaper delivered to his house, he prefers driving the 10 minutes to pick it up, because it's not about the newspaper. It's about the people he meets on the way. So, I know if he says, Brian, let's go get the newspaper, that we might as well just pack the whole family and we're gone for four hours. Right, because his goal actually is relationship, and so that means that anything that brings relationship on the journey fulfills his goal, right? It's a detour to getting the paper. For me, my goal is not relationship. I have no desire to know anyone there that I don't know. I don't mean that negatively, but I'm probably not going to have a relationship with them after this. So, I have one goal, get the newspaper. And guess what? Anything else is a distraction for me that keeps me from that goal, because it doesn't grow me, it doesn't do that. I use that as an illustration to say, one of the reasons why one person's detour can be another person's distraction is what God has called them to. The goal of this might be different. So, it's absolutely fundamental in being able to have discernment regarding what's the difference between a detour and a distraction is to know what God has called you to. And sometimes then, even if you're still not really sure, and so that's when we go back and say, God, what is this? Help me, show me. And so, I think that you mentioned a couple of things here that I found interesting. And I want to go back. Don't let me forget before we get off this point. You were mentioning your house and just said, every once in a while, when we talk, things pop in our head. Is that distractions can look good. That's not the point. The point is, are they what God has asked us to do in that moment? And I think that's really a hard thing to delineate. So, let me give you an example of what could be a detour and what could be a distraction. So, again, not handy. We know that, right? So, you are on a timeline. You have a timeline in your head to get the house done and that sort of thing. But here's what I also know. You need other people to come along. And we have a mutual friend, I won't mention his name here, who's also not handy. I wish you could see that. If you're listening, I just keep doing jazz hands for some reason. I don't know why. Maybe that's my version of handy. So, you have, at least on one occasion that I'm aware of, invited that person into the process. Now, for you, that's a detour, not a distraction, because I know God's heart, how he made you to help grow other people. He's using a house, which you have a goal to get done, at a slower pace to disciple someone else through your house. Now, that could be, if you see it wrong, which you don't, I don't think, as a distraction. Great, I've got to help somebody else, but I really want to get this done. But it's really a detour because God, as you have mentioned many times, he's not just doing one thing at a time. And so, he's using this house, which you have a goal. And in this case, it's not a distraction. It's actually a detour, because he's growing you, and he's growing this other person, because there are things that this other person has expressed to both of us that he didn't have experiences, and that you're helping him see more of God by doing these things, and to view himself the way God is. How amazing is that, that you couldn't do if your house was all put together? So, can I come over later? No, I'm just kidding. Anytime. So, I wanted to give that as an example, going back to your house. The way to know the difference, though, is to ask God. Because this is happening, like, and you turn your house into everybody's got to figure out how to do their own home project. I think that might be a distraction. But there are detours where you're bringing other people along, and they're obviously helping you, but you're helping them. Yeah. So, one of the things to become aware of is, like you said, God's usually after more than one thing. And we often don't see the big picture the way that God does at the outset. God's very kind in giving us what we're able to navigate and manage at the time. And so, God doesn't give Nehemiah all the goals that he's after, and yet it's very clear by the end of the story that God had at least two goals, not one. That God wasn't only focused on rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem. God was focused on rebuilding his people. And in fact, part of the reason why the walls weren't rebuilt, because the people were torn down. And later on, we get to Nehemiah, they're going to open up the scroll, they're going to read things. And we recognize that if that part would have been more in line, the walls would have been built a long time ago. But God often, the methodology and the order and the manner to which he does stuff doesn't always fit exactly how we know. Which brings us to, like, you know, how do I know which is which is one question. But the next question is, well, when do I know which is which? Right, right. And so, just be cognizant of there's usually more than one thing going on. And Nehemiah, to his credit, doesn't seem to have tunnel vision. On the walls are the only thing that matter, and I'm willing to sacrifice all the people necessary to make it happen. The constant way in which he provides for his people's protection, that the work slows down because people are working with one hand and have one hand on their web. The pace of work slows down because the good of the people became another important goal, not just the completion of the walls. And so, be cognizant of that. Don't get tunnel vision on, but this is the thing that God burdened me with. This is the thing that God told me to do. I have to do this. And everything else is a distant second, if not third. Ask God. Ask him what else he's up to. Ask him what else he values in the midst of this journey. The detours aren't bad, per se. The distractions can be. And so, if on the road trip, God's goal for your road trip is relational connection, then stopping at 12 different diners and three antique stores is actually good. Yeah, but I draw the line at Craft Mall, just for the record. That's fair. That's fair. Yeah, but then it's also the, all right, well, then how do I know? We often don't find out until the end. Like you said, that is the other issue at hand, is God doesn't give us the plan up front. He doesn't say, here's my top three goals for this project, and here are the ways in which I would like you to carry all of them out, and now go execute this perfectly. It's, here's where I want you to start. Nehemiah, I want you to be burdened for this the way that I am. Nehemiah, I want you to ask the king, you don't know where this is going yet, but I want you to trust me that this is going somewhere. Nehemiah, I want you to go back to Jerusalem. I want you to take stock of the situation. You don't know how to fix it yet, but we're going to get there. It's walking with God. It's not doing things for God. It's doing things with God, and that's the difference. And so that gets us to this third part, right work at the right time. So say a little something about that. Okay, I'll say a little something about right work at right time, and I think this applies to what we're talking about, but I want to back up just for a second, and here's why, because it's probably me projecting me, but hopefully I'm not alone. There are some of us that will begin to hear some of this about distraction and detour who are deeply afraid of getting it wrong. And the heart of this is not about making you afraid to get it wrong, but it's actually about where is your heart in the process. So I've told a story many times about my son and cleaning his room. I'm actually not going to tell that story. I'm actually going to tell a story that just happened. I just had an opportunity to sit in my office and talk to someone about baptism. And so the conversation about baptism was from different sort of theological backgrounds, denominations, you grew up Lutheran, for example, how they view baptism, right? They would see as a young child, you get sprinkled. Our church views that as child dedication, and we wouldn't sprinkle. But later on in the Lutheran, when your faith is yours, you go through a confirmation, which is a public profession. For us at this church, when we believe your faith is yours, your public profession is baptism. So we were having a conversation around that. And this is where I wanted to land the plane on it. I said, you know what? I said, this is what I believe the heart of God really is around this, is that you're publicly aligning yourself with him. So I'm not, I don't believe that we'll get to heaven. And if all of a sudden that you did confirmation and I did baptism, that Jesus is going to go, yeah, I know your heart was to publicly align with me, but you checked the wrong box there, so you're out. But I think that's the fear sometimes, right? That we're more focused on the mode or the outcome than the heart behind it. And I'm not trying to diminish the theological implications of baptism. What I'm saying is if someone gets wrapped around the axle about the fact that the methodology was one way when it's really first and foremost about the heart of what it's projecting, there's a problem. And I think that's what happens to us in this way. We first missed our heart. And, you know, in that story about Bodie that I've told many times is, did my son, did I have my son's heart? And the answer was yes. And God's questioned us over and over again. Does he have our hearts in this? Because that comes in with distractions and detours. And it does come in with right work at right time. Now, Ephesians, I referenced Ephesians 1. In verse 16 and 17, it's the first prayer that Paul gives in Ephesians. He gives two. Actually, he does a prayer for wisdom and enlightenment, and then he does a prayer for power. In Ephesians 1, verse 16, he says, I have this prayer. I remember you in my prayers that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, will give you a spirit of wisdom and a spirit of revelation. Now, depending on what versions you look at, sometimes the S is highlighted or rather capitalized in people trying to say it's the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is included in that, but actually I think it is a demeanor of wisdom and demeanor of revelation that comes from the Holy Spirit that matters because I'm about to separate the difference between spirit of wisdom and spirit of revelation. And if it's the Holy Spirit, you can't really separate those two. So a spirit of wisdom, as I understand scripture, is insight from the Holy Spirit on how to use knowledge you've already attained. While spirit of revelation is insight from the Holy Spirit, revealing things we cannot see on our own about knowledge we've not already attained. And so right work at the right time. When I talk about the danger of disorder, I think there could be a temptation. We said God will provide, right? Number one, and God had provided all of this, that some people could have seen the three days that Nehemiah was planning as a distraction. Well, God said he's going to provide. I've got the power. I've got the letters. Let's just go grab all the people. This is why I'm here and boom, boom, boom. And I'm not saying that that can't be a way that God does it. But in general, as I referred to earlier on when I talk about the parable of the talents, Luke chapter 14, is that God has given us gifts that he expects us to try to exercise. But when we exercise them, go to the Holy Spirit with those gifts and say, is this how I'm supposed to do it? I'm pretty sure fundamentally that Nehemiah had a conceptual idea of how to put together a wall. So when he was going around, I'm sure he was looking at the physical stuff, but he was probably developing strategies of what part of the walls are most open to these sort of things because they were surrounded by enemies everywhere. What should we do first? What should we do? All of that, right? And so getting out of this place where we go out of balance to one or the other. And honestly, I think sometimes our balance is due to preference and personality preference. We all have temperaments, and I think our temperaments have God wired us, and I think we lean towards one or the other. I lean, and this is not new information for anyone that knows me well at all, way too heavy on my own and the wisdom. Well, why do I need to ask God when he's given me a brain, right? And there are times where God's like, why are you asking me about this? It's in the Bible. You should do this. But also there are times where like, okay, I know how to put together a wall, but God give me insight about is this the way that we should do it? On the other hand, there are people who lean, who just don't like to plan. And I've heard like, hey, well, the spirit will show up. And again, the spirit can at any point, but maybe the Holy Spirit has shown up by giving you because all our wisdom and all our intent, that all is a gift from God. And he's an expectant way. I'm going to use it in sermon prep. I doubt very many of you listening have ever prepped a sermon, but I still remember one of my mentors saying this, Brian, you should show up on Sunday to speak expectant for the Holy Spirit to show up there. And his point was like, don't come with your notes and not be open to wherever the Holy Spirit goes. But then he also said, you should not show up on Sunday, expecting the Holy Spirit to fill in for you on Sunday, things that he wanted to speak to you on Monday through Saturday. What was his point? He means you better have a plan too, that you've spoken to God. And so when I sermon prep, that's me surveying the walls, right? And there's going to be changes. There's going to be that where God's going to get there on Sunday. It's changing. And I think none of us, it's so interesting in the spiritual realm. I talked about a road trip. We maybe, I don't know anyone who's just decided I'm going to go somewhere for a month and they've decided and they've left an hour later. Just don't say, I mean, they make a plan. Where are we going to stay? Where are we going to go? Because that's wisdom and we're supposed to use it. Getting the disorder and that danger, I just think is really important. And as I looked at that moment of the three days that he spent, I think it could have been easy just to kind of gloss over it. He wasn't, I don't see anywhere in here it was three days where he was resting, which by the way, wouldn't have been a problem if that's what God asked him to do. Because he's about to have seven day a week sort of, except for the Sabbath, like a lot of work to be done. So it would have been fine if he did because the journey was at least two months. Ezra's journey took five because of all the things he had with him. So it was a long journey. He needed a break. But he was using that. And I felt like even as I put this together, I don't know how to communicate it as well as I want to. But I just want to say both spirit of wisdom and spirit of revelation need the involvement of the Holy Spirit. It needs that. And we have to be careful about how we're engaging the something greater. Yeah. And I've realized, you know, having been around church for a little bit, I've recognized that people will sometimes insert a third category into these two categories of spirit of wisdom and spirit of revelation and that they conflate the spirit of wisdom with wisdom. Ah, yeah. Oh, yeah. Thank you for making that. That's a great important. That wisdom is what I know based on my experiences, right? It's what makes sense to me. I'm remodeling my house. You do framing and then you do plumbing. And then you do electrical and then you do drywall. And then you get to do the fun stuff like painting and then flooring so you don't get paint all over your floor. That's wisdom. That's just straight-up wisdom. The spirit of wisdom, like you said, is special insight from the Holy Spirit on how to use the knowledge already attained. And so there's been times where working on my house, I've felt the nudge to either do something out of that particular order or to really make sure I stick to that order. It's been special insight on how to use the knowledge I already have. That wasn't just wisdom. And some of you may be struggling thinking God cares about the order of how you put that in there. I would just say is why wouldn't he? Yeah. Why wouldn't he? I mean, if we're his kids and we think about our kids, if we have kids or God kids or whatever it might be, we would care enough to be involved in that. He cares enough. Right. And so I think sometimes I've seen people associate the spirit of revelation with what the spirit of wisdom does and the spirit of wisdom just be wisdom. So wisdom is what I think, and then the spirit of revelation is God telling me better clarification of what I think. And that's not it because there is nothing God will ask us to do that he intends us to complete without him. Yep. And so Nehemiah rebuilding the walls wasn't, all right, God, you got me here. I'll see you in 52 days. As he's walking around the city over those three days, I have to imagine that he's open to God showing him, okay, here's where we start. Here's the things we prioritize. There is special insight coming to him that's informing his knowledge of how to rebuild walls. God didn't send a total novice there and expect to just perform miraculous, you know, like bomb dropping of, all right, now do this. You have no idea how to do this. I'm going to talk you through all of it. He sent somebody that knows how to do the thing, but he also sent somebody that is open and receptive to his leading and guiding in how to go about doing the thing and then also responds with moments of revelation of, hey, there's people plotting against you. You wouldn't have known that. There's a part later on we'll get to where someone comes and it seems like a seemingly good thing. Hey, we're inviting you to the blah, blah, blah, blah, right? It says more than blah, blah, blah, but I'm trying not to give it away. But if you've been reading the EMI, you already know. But no, no. God's like, nope, that's a trap. That's a trap. Things he could not have known on his own. Right, right. So I'm going to show you things you couldn't have known, and then I'm going to give you insight on how to navigate it. Here's something you couldn't have known. There's people plotting against you. Here's now insight on how to go about it. Send this message. Respond in this way. There is nothing God will ask us to do that he intends us to complete without him. And so you had talked about this last week, that feeling of, well, I'm supposed to be responsible. Yeah. And so again, the reminder that that's not how God thinks. That's not how God works. There is a part that's our part, and our part is to listen and obey, to walk with God and talk to him and listen to him talking to us. That's our part. Our part is not, all right, God, you sent me here. I'll go take care of everything now, and I'll report back when it's complete. The invitation is always with. The invitation is to abide. If you abide in me, you will bear much fruit. It's not go apart from me and come back and show me what you produced. Again, you go back to what you were intended to do as a child of God, and it's Genesis 1, and it's Revelation 21. God dwelling with you, you dwelling with God, walking together, talking together, living together. That was the goal from the beginning. It's the goal at the end, and everything in between is an opportunity to see that goal restored as we go about doing the things. God's goal was not just the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem. God's goal was the rebuilding of his people, and the way that he went about rebuilding his people was through a project, was through a task that would rally together and galvanize his people back into his presence. One of the diagnostics that I would encourage you to think about that's connected here but not really I brought out is that sometimes the outward realities of your life are reflective of the inward truths you're believing. The outward reality of the Jewish people in Jerusalem and in Judah was simply this. The walls were torn down. The walls were torn down simply because something injured them and their relationship with God was broken. Maybe, just maybe in your own life, it's a decent thing to take an inventory of what are your metaphorical walls? How are they? What are they doing? What is it saying about where you are with God? We've said this in this podcast so many times, but it bears repeating. The enemy comes in and gives us plausible alternative truths. We plant plausible alternative truths. By the way, both of those are just fancy words for lies about ourselves, others, the world, God. In those moments, especially when it comes here when we're stepping out but we don't know how to live out, those plausible alternative truths, we're going to play in our own mind, or the enemy is going to come and bring them. Like, this is too big. You can't do this. You're right. You can't. I can't. Because there's nothing he's asked to do that we can do on our own. I mean, that big accidental lie, because I don't hear anyone say it intentionally, but if you ever hear someone say, God will not give you anything big enough that you can't handle, it's a complete and utter lie. The answer is, God will not give you anything big enough that he can't handle when you invite him in. He's constantly giving us things big enough we can handle for the purpose of being dependent upon him to grow us. And so, you know, not being overwhelmed in the midst of these big things is hard, but the good news is you have a God that'll never leave us or forsake us. He'll supply all your needs. Where he calls, Matthew chapter 20, all authority in heaven is given to you. Where I call you, I will give you authority and power. And so finding those moments to go back to God, ask him, Spirit of Wisdom, how do I live this out? You know, Spirit of Revelation, is there something I'm missing? And I ask that prayer a lot because I do feel that way. Recently, I've described how I've felt recently, a little bit like a dull butter knife. And if you've ever seen a butter knife, they're not super sharp anyway. But in moments when you feel maybe in prolonged periods of like a dull butter knife in your life, you know you have to go like, Jesus, I'm pretty sure there's things here I'm missing. So thank you for your Spirit of Revelation. Let me hear. And I think sometimes in my own personal life, again, side note, I think sometimes God lets me go through those dull butter knife points because it makes me more dependent on the Spirit of Revelation. Because I can become overtly dependent on a different way. Wisdom. Not Spirit of Wisdom, but Wisdom. Yeah. And so you'd ask the question on Sunday, where are you at a balance in living out of a Spirit of Wisdom and a Spirit of Revelation? And again, Spirit of Wisdom is not what I think and the Spirit of Revelation is what God thinks. Spirit of Wisdom is what the Holy Spirit is showing you that's actionable. And the Spirit of Revelation is things that we could not have seen on our own. That in many cases, we may then need a Spirit of Wisdom moment to inform the Spirit of Revelation moment. Here's something you couldn't have known. Now that you know it, here's what you do about it. Let me just give a real practical thing. You and I sit with lots of people, lots of times. And there's times where I've been sitting with people and praying, and I'm like, God, I'm not sure what's going on in this person's life. And very clearly, I feel like God has said, this is what's going on in a person's life. That's the Spirit of Revelation. Now, I have experience and background that says, okay, if this person has this going on in their life, these are some tools I can put. The next thing that I need to do, though, after he says, this is what's going on in his life, is, all right, God, how do I use these tools that you've given me? I think you need to think about it that way. Because that happens to me a lot, actually. Yeah, and so it's the reminder for me, and this quote is always one that helps sort of bring me back to this as a reminder of what's real and what's true. It's this quote from Howard Macy, that the spiritual life cannot be made suburban. And by that, when I think of the suburbs, I think of the convenience of the suburbs, right? It's not quite urban. It's not quite rural. It's the best of both worlds. It's the comforts of both without the inconveniences of either, everything's five minutes away. And he's saying the spiritual life cannot be made that. It's always frontier. And we who live in it must accept and even rejoice that it remains untamed. That's the life that God delights in inviting us into. And you notice throughout the Scriptures, the people that get closest to God are the people that God invites out into the wilderness. The people that have to go to the place where they don't know how to do it on their own, their wisdom. And they have to rely on the spirit of wisdom. Here's how you use the things that you do know. And the spirit of revelation, here's things that you couldn't have known. God leads people to places where they have to learn who he is and who they are. And that's never stopped being the invitation. That didn't stop being the invitation once the Old Testament was finished because the spirit leads Jesus into the wilderness to discover the reality of who his father is and who he is because God just told him that at his baptism. You're my son. I'm your father who is well pleased with you. And now we're going to go experience this for 40 days in the wilderness. We're going to prove it to be true so that it's not just intellectual knowledge. And he does it with Paul. After his eyes are healed, Paul tells us at the beginning of Galatians that he was led into the wilderness for like 14 years to learn from Jesus. This has never stopped being the plan. And this isn't just a geographical wilderness. This isn't like you got to leave Loudoun County now and move out to Percival, which is still the suburbs, by the way. But it's the spiritual reality of this life that we are meant to move from a place of dependency on self, our understanding and our abilities and move to a place where we can't do it on our own. We have to do it with God. We can't even do it alone with God. We have to do it with God and with others to accomplish something greater. It's never stopped being the goal. No. And wherever you are on this journey, know we're on it with you. We've not arrived at all. And I say this often. So if you're on this journey and you would like to talk to us about where we're on the journey or where you are on the journey, we'll invite God into that space. We'll all have a conversation. It'll be great. You can get a hold of us at faithforward at cfcyr.org. Yeah. And this is a time usually where John says, you know, on behalf of Brian and on behalf of me, you know, thanks. So I'll say on behalf of me, Brian, and on behalf of John, the sharp-dressed man, Ackerman, thanks for listening. ♪♪
