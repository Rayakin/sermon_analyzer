Welcome back to the Faith Forward Podcast, John Ackerman, Brian Bales, and it's time for something new today. If you've been with us for the last few weeks, we've been doing a series called retuning. That is true. And honestly, I had a lot of fun doing that. I think you had a lot of fun. We had a lot of fun. Um, so if you didn't catch that series, it'd definitely be worth a trip back to the archives, both for the Sunday sermon message and also for the four weeks of podcasts that we had. Uh, but we're turning the page today and we're going to talk about Nehemiah. Yeah. And as I said on Sunday, uh, which by the way, even though today is something new, thank you for keeping the tradition of plaid. I realized I've not quite yet broken out the plaid I'm holding, I'm holding the feeling of summer, but that has nothing to do with what we're really talking about. And those who are just listening clearly and not watching, don't know what we're talking about. Right. But as I introduced on, on Sunday, um, uh, I did the quote from a song called, uh, closing time. It says every new beginning comes from some other beginnings end. And what I don't want people to separate is that Nehemiah and what we're talking about over the next many weeks actually comes from the end of that new beginning of retuning. We ended that series, uh, on the third focus that we believe will help us be indispensable. The community God has called us to, and that is the biblical reality and principle and the call that we are better together. And in my opinion, there is no one complete book in the whole of the Bible that illustrates the necessity and the value of what happens when people gather together to accomplish something greater than themselves than Nehemiah. And so in many ways, it's a very, you know, uh, complete series around this last idea. So when we dig into Nehemiah, I didn't really talk about this much on Sunday. If you've ever been a part of a church, if you've ever been a part of a Bible study lots of times when you dig into the book of Nehemiah, the focus solely is on Nehemiah and his skill and his ability and his attributes as a leader. And there's not a thing wrong with that. Nehemiah was an amazingly gifted leader. What made him so amazingly gifted has not to do with some types of things that we would often read in leadership books, even though he had those, was the fact that he was in tune with what God wanted and he was willing to step in all the time. I'm not going to downplay that in this series, but I do think what often happens, especially in our individualized Western cultural world, we tend to read things through the individual lens. We're going to miss something significant if we read Nehemiah and see it only through the greatness of the leader of Nehemiah. God used Nehemiah to play his role, but God used everyone. Nehemiah could not accomplish what happens in the book of Nehemiah by himself. And there's some biblical things that we need to grasp and understand that we are better together, that if God has called us for something greater as individuals in our families at work or whatever, even if it's the individual call, we're going to need other people to make it happen. Certainly as a church, I believe that God has placed us where we're placed, and I understand people watch this podcast who aren't from Loudoun County, Virginia or Ashland, Virginia, and we love that you do. We really do. But there's something very unique about, I believe, the vision that God's placed in our church is that he's placed us here to be indispensable at minimum to the community, that he's physically geographically located us in. And there's no way, no way we can accomplish that without being together. It's just not. And let me just tell you this. On my best day, I don't know how great of a leader Nehemiah was, but let's just say on my best day, if I was one one hundredth of the leader of Nehemiah was, I'd feel good. Nehemiah couldn't accomplish what God has called us to do as a church by himself. No one can. And so we're going to dig into that. And so we sort of opened up Nehemiah chapter one and we just, boom, we dropped straight in a little bit like a Star Wars episode. That's why that's a rolling scroll that tells you what's going on. Because if you drop into the book of Nehemiah, and this is the case with lots of texts, but very much so in Nehemiah, without having that sort of scrolling thing when you would watch an early Star Wars movie to tell you what's been going on, there's so much you're missing. You won't understand the burden on Nehemiah's heart. You won't understand the shame that is brought to God because Jerusalem existed the way it is. And you won't understand why God is doing what he's doing to allow what is happening to the people of Israel in that moment. There's so much there and we're going to get to it. Some today, most all of it, though, over the next several weeks. Yeah. And we've got several weeks coming in this book on Nehemiah. And like you said, part of what we're focusing on is the character and the actions of Nehemiah himself, both as a leader of people, but also as a follower of God. And again, we were just joking about this before we hit record. We know that most people don't pay attention to sermon series titles. It's mostly for the creative folks, you know, behind the scenes and as a way for teachers to keep their thoughts organized into chunks, which I did in my classroom all the time. So I absolutely get it. But there's something about this series title for something greater that really, I think for me, emphasizes a theme I've been noticing in my own life lately. And you touched on it already that in our 21st century Western culture, we have a tendency to individualize things sometimes to extremes. We love the Avengers approach, the DC superheroes approach of the super powered individual or maybe a couple of super powered individuals that can do amazing things in small numbers, almost in defiance of whole groups of people that often they're fighting against. And it seems like we've lost track of, not only does God insist on inviting us into things that we can't do on our own, but we have to do with him. But he then goes a step further and insists on inviting us into things that we can't do on our own with him, but that we have to do with him and with a whole bunch of other people in order to accomplish things on the level of magnitude that he's interested in. And I've come to realize just how often I've allowed my relationship with God to become so focused on the personal, which is a good thing, that I have lost track of the people of God as the overarching and overriding theme throughout the narrative of the scriptures. That is really God's heart is that he would call all the individual people back to him, that he has named individually and loved individually and ransomed individually so that the people of God could accomplish something that the individual people of God couldn't. And so just even as we've started this series, it's been scratching that for me in ways that I've realized I've been so focused on me and God that many times I've missed me and God and everybody else. I love the word picture. As teachers, we're always trying to find illustrations that resonate. And I love the example that you just used because the Marvel universe, the Avengers are pretty much embedded in our culture at significant ways. And all those singular movies were great. But if you've seen the, you know, the big last one of the last series, you know, there's this moment where Captain America finally says his famous line, Avengers assemble. And there is a bunch of them. I mean, it's not like five, you know, 500, I don't know how many are actually there. And what actually in that moment that movie is illustrating is this point that there are some things so great that can't be overcome just by one. And I would like to say that certainly in light of that, that, you know, it's overcoming evil clearly. And there is some understanding that God has placed us a salt and light in this world to make a difference. Romans chapter 12, verse 21, if I was ever going to get a tattoo, I would have some version of the word overcome in Romans 12, 21 on me, which says, do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good, right? That's the call. And by the way, when he wrote that, he wrote it to the church at Rome, which means the church at Rome should not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. It is a personal thing that I would be willing if I was going to get a tattoo, but I don't like pain that much on me, I'd put on. But that is a call of all of us, right? But all of us need to be involved. All of us need to be involved to assemble. In fact, you know what? You know, we always have like a second name for this podcast, which long time podcast listeners knows is Ask God. Maybe the second name for this series should have been Avengers Assemble. That would have been, we probably would have got sued somehow for some sort of copyright infringement. But yeah. So if you're listening to this podcast or watching it, maybe we're just going to refer for something greater slash Avengers Assemble. That would be good. We could do that. But the point is they're overcoming evil for us. Not only are we overcoming evil, but it's one thing to overcome evil. It's another thing to do good. And the things that God calling us is to do good. And by nature, when we do good, it does overcome evil. And we can't do the good that God has called us to in this fallen, broken world as effectively as individuals. We can, as we can together. And I know we've spent a lot of time already at the beginning of this podcast talking about the theory of this series. But for me, ultimately, why I'm trying to approach this book this way is because I do believe we will miss something significant about what God is trying to illustrate here. If we take this only through the lens of, look how great Nehemiah of a leader that he was in this individual, but rather what God can and does and desire to do through a group of people. Yeah. And so as we start today, as always, the goal is to be practical. How do we implement this in our life? What are the nuts and bolts of this? And so we are going to start with some of the personal because that's where it does have to begin. If we go back to the Avengers analogy, all of those individuals have to accept and pursue the calling on their life to be the part of the entirety that is needed. And if any one of them just expects the rest of the team to carry the weight, the whole thing falls apart. And so there is an absolutely critical personal element to this. You are called by God to such a time and such a place with unique giftings and personality and temperament. You are, you are needed. The truest you, the, the empowered you, the redeemed you is needed and you can't do it on your own. And so you asked some questions in Sunday's message, which brings the obligatory comment for me of, if you haven't watched the Sunday message, pause here, go back, we'll wait, watch the Sunday message. But you asked some questions along the lines of, am I even aware of what God is doing? Right? Nehemiah first and foremost illustrates a contextual awareness of what's happening, not only in his life, but geographically in the empire and in home, at home. Am I aware of what God is doing? Or am I just sort of like head down, getting through my day, checking things off the list and we'll do it again tomorrow. So one, am I aware of what God is doing? Two, am I seeing the situation clearly? And that's a critical clarifying question. Not just do I think I know what God is doing, but do I know what God is doing? Am I seeing the situation clearly? You also asked, where do you individually, personally, because the personal matters here, where do you feel God's burden for something greater? There were any number of tasks that God did not set Nehemiah to, but he did set him specifically to the task of rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem. Prior to that, he had specifically set in the heart of Zerubbabel and Ezra, the rebuilding of the temple. He didn't send Nehemiah to rebuild the temple. He didn't send Ezra to rebuild the walls. There are particular things that have been placed in your heart by God. Are you aware of it? Are you paying attention? Or is it one of those things that comes up sort of like hunger pains of like, I should really eat. I'm in the middle of something. I'll get to it later. And then the last question, are we acting before reflecting? Is it some of that impulse purchasing that we do sometimes? I see it. I want it. Click. Ship same day. Or are we taking the time to pause and reflect? And as we were talking before, I know that the time to pause and reflect was actually one of the things that really moved you in this most recent iteration of Nehemiah. So we're going to talk there at the start about taking the time to make sure we're seeing clearly what God is doing and not just assuming we know what God is doing. Yeah. So one of the things that I think we often do, so we're asking ourselves to take what we learned on Sunday and move our faith forward. I think we are people who have been given wisdom by God, I mean, given intelligence by God. And so lots of times when scenarios come up, when we hear about things and that sort of stuff, it becomes really, really easy to just begin to say, oh, this is what's happening. This is why it's happening or this is how it needs to be done. And again, it's going to be one of those times on a podcast where I'll probably jump around a lot, John. So thanks for herding the cat that I am in that way. Especially I think when we recognize something is off. I think there's something good and righteous and holy about it when someone recognizes something's off and they want to step in there. And when we start with Nehemiah, what's interesting is, is that he seems to be one of the few people that recognizes something is off. It's sort of a reminder, Ezra did go back in to rebuild the temple. That was at least 12 years before this is happening. So maybe 432 BC, this is occurring around 444 BC, give or take. But yet the walls weren't rebuilt. And again, I talked about this on Sunday. For those of us who don't understand ancient culture, we live that, why does that matter? And so I used an illustration, think of it this way. What would you think about a country if their embassy got overthrown and their flag was taken down, right? Then you're starting to see, well, that would bring shame on the country that Jerusalem was the city of God, right? It was designed, God brought it there. It created it. There's so many things I talk about Jerusalem that when it wasn't there, it was actually reflecting something to God. And in fact, when the people of God weren't doing what God had asked them to do, they also had some problems. Deuteronomy chapter 28 through Deuteronomy chapter 32 is a section of the old covenant where God just makes an agreement with his people that says, if you do this, I'll do this. I'm not going to do this. And again, we use this language here. This isn't saying that God's a transactional God. It's not what he's saying in this, because I do use that language. We often approach God that way. It's his set out covenant agreements, right? He's letting us know up front, right? And he gave some things and here's what's also occurring. Nehemiah in this moment was burdened by the fact that the people of God not only weren't caring about the city of God and the walls, but they weren't caring about the name of God and the way that they were acting. And so there was a whole lot of things that were going wrong, not just at the city level, but being the people of God, being persecuted, the people of God, all this sort of thing happening. And it seemed like no one else was seeing the situation clearly. Maybe there was, this is all the text tells us. But it is clear that God has placed Nehemiah, and again, this is about something bigger, but God often places an individual as a catalyst for something greater. This is not meant to be sacrilegious, going with our Avengers. I love Avengers. There's a Nick Fury that brings people together at the right place, the right resources, right there. You alluded a little bit right there when you were talking about for such a time as this, which is a reference to Esther. And when we understand where Nehemiah sits, it's also under the Persian government, which Esther was. And most likely Nehemiah served the king who was one of the sons of the king that Esther was married to, right? We don't know which one. It might've even been Esther's son. I doubt it, but we don't know. We don't know this stuff, but we do know that God is always still working and still giving me a chance. And so Nehemiah was uniquely positioned to make a difference, but he had to be aware. And so it begins to make me wonder certain things. Number one, Acts 17 says that we are where we are for a purpose and a time and a place. We talked about this recently in a class that I had a chance to talk about, you know, praying through scripture and claiming the promises of God. And someone in the class talked about how they were just really struggling, you know, and how would this help? And I said, well, Acts chapter 17 says this is a mistake. And he also says, I will never leave you and forsake you. So you pray that promise to say, God, where are you in the midst of this? Show me yourself, right? It was, it was amazingly powerful. You are where you are for a reason, no matter what it is for something greater to Nehemiah was there. But the reason that some of these next have happened was, is he chose to be intimately aware of the situation around him and he desired to honor God. And so I think around this idea, you know, when we think about some of these clarifying things, are we, are we aware? And then are we seeing the situation clearly? It's a great place to start because a lot of why he then went and prayed, and this is one of nine prayers. The first one in chapter one, a lot of why he went and prayed was because not only do you see the situation clearly from the standpoint of what was going on in the people's lives, but he also understood the text. He understood Deuteronomy 28 through 32. He understood that God was a promise keeping God, the good promises and the difficulty. And he put it together and said, Oh, more than anything, this is a physical problem that has a spiritual root in it, which is why he went and then confessed and repented. And again, I'm a little all over the place, but when it comes to us, are we seeing the situation clearly? Or if we put our own set of blinders, what is it, how are we inviting God? And are we in, do we desire to honor God with what we're doing? Or certainly if it's a difficult situation, my desire often is just to get out of it as fast as possible. Yeah. Yeah. Fix it and just make it go away. Yeah. And so one of the things that we're going to start with is the things that help us to make sure we're seeing the situation clearly, the things that help us to make sure that we're becoming aware of what God is doing, not just what we think God is doing, not just what we think God should be doing. And you see so often throughout the scriptures, how often people quickly latch onto, I think God is doing this. Here I go. Right. You see that with Saul persecuting Christians in Acts. I'm pretty sure I know that God doesn't like this guy, Jesus. I'm pretty sure I know that God doesn't like these people following Jesus. I'm pretty sure God wants me to put a stop to this. Moses is a great example in the old Testament. Well, this is exactly how he brought water last time. This is how he wants to bring water this time. Right. And Moses had a relationship with God, right? And but didn't go back. Right. And so one of the things that we were appreciating about Nehemiah is the time that Nehemiah takes to not only double check the what that he has a burning passion for, but the how, the why, the when, the who, the where, all those other important questions. And so the invitation for us is not that this becomes programmatic, not that you have to do it exactly for how long Nehemiah did or in the exact way, but, and again, we're talking about big things for something greater. This isn't about how I get from morning to afternoon per se, though it's the same thing, just scaled up multiple times. These are about the things that have captivated your heart and your imagination, the things that perhaps you've been dreaming about for years, and you would just love to see brought to fulfillment. And we sometimes feel like God gives us the word go. And so how do we, how do we handle the big things faithfully? Well, we handle the big things faithfully in the same way we handle the small things faithfully, which I appreciate Jesus saying that that's often why we start with the small things. You prove that you're faithful with that, I'll give you more. How do we handle the big things? How do we make sure we're seeing the situation clearly? Some of this just comes from becoming aware of our defaults. Because for some of us, if we feel like God has placed a burden on our heart, we are gung ho to get started because our default is I will start something new at the drop of a hat. In fact, I got 12 things started right now and none of them get done. Yeah. And you know, I think as I was looking through some of the defaults that we have, it also illustrates why we're better together sometimes, because there are some people out there who God is amazingly gifted to be, as I referred to a friend of mine just recently, a serial entrepreneur. They're amazingly at getting things started that other people couldn't get started. But they're not so good at the other things that need to come to keep it successful. They need that. So for some people, you know, it is this like, hey, let me start something new. For other people, like you mentioned, it's a, well, let me, let me think throughout all the possibilities, but then they don't ever do something. I would like to say that actually, if you put that person who thinks with all the possibilities with a person who, you know, is let's get it started and both of them have a heart to do what God wants, they're better together. Some of that's about natural wiring, how God has made us. But some of it is this idea, okay, it's my natural wiring, but God doesn't actually always ask us to live out of our natural wiring, right? He asks us to live out of our supernatural wiring. So going back there. So even that, when we mentioned some of these things as weaknesses, it's a weakness if we don't talk to God, but it's also, even if we talk to God, that serial entrepreneur, they need someone with them. They do. They've got to. That person who's really great at creating a plan, but maybe not knowing how to execute the plan. Um, here's a good example, John, I, I can tell you 101 ways to start a conversation in a large group of people. And I stink at all 101 of them. I don't, I, I'm, I just, I walked into a big thing the other day and realized this makes me uncomfortable. I know all the things I should do and how to start a conversation, but Kathy wasn't with me, my wife and I, I, you know, my friend who I was there to honor, who is a serial entrepreneur had never seen a group of people he couldn't connect with. He, I had no one to be my wingman or for me to be their wingman. Right. And it was hard. And so just because I know doesn't mean you can, just because you can, doesn't mean you know how to do it. And that's part of the teamwork in there. So I love that. Are we seeing it clearly? Are we just immediately going with what we're naturally wired to do when maybe God is asking us something supernatural? Yeah. I mean, a lot of us just get super pragmatic. You know, there was a group of people that Nehemiah was having to deal with that had gone back to Jerusalem, but rather than rebuilding the walls, they'd rebuilt their own houses, which again, you can't fault him for that's a very practical thing to do, but that wasn't necessarily what God was asking of his people. Yeah. And it's not like God's doesn't, doesn't say here that he doesn't want you to have whatever version of a roof over there they had, but I'll get into this a little bit on Sunday and there's so much of the history. At minimum, it had been 12 years. Look, I'm not handy. We know this, right? We know this, but I feel comfortable that if you gave me 12 years to get a house built somehow or another, I would have gotten to it a lot faster than a full 12 years. Probably year three or four, I'd have been like, all right, John, here's the deal. You come help me. I won't give you as much help as you help me, but I'll figure out a way to help you. We'll be better together. They'd found ways to do that yet they'd gotten sucked into their culture. They got sucked into their personal needs. They got sucked in a way of living that God didn't want. And all of a sudden other things that were important about showing the glory of God fell off their radar, which by the way, I don't think they woke up and decided to do that because a lot of these people and a, the number I believe off the top of my head, I have to look later on in Nehemiah. This was some study before it was about 70,000 that went back, right? So number one, there was enough people to build the walls, right? And a lot of these people, you have to think about their hearts. They, some of them maybe actually had never lived in Jerusalem. They'd grown up in captivity. Some of them may be old enough that they live there. Again, we know from Ezra that there were some people that saw the new temple built that remembered the old temple. And so they cried. So there was a mixture of people that went back. But I would like to say this, they had a good heart in going back to honor God. Don't miss that. Sometimes we start well, we have the right heart. But these things that come into our life and distract us, no one decides to step into something greater for God and think to themselves, well, I'm going to get lazy or that. And so maybe that's a question. Maybe it's not the, maybe we could look at them and go, oh, I can't believe how they're doing that. Maybe they just let the lesser things in life come in front of the greater things in life. And that I can really relate to. And notice the team that we're building. As you start to put these different temperaments together, you need the visionary entrepreneurial type and you need the one that actually executes the vision. And the pragmatist isn't actually a bad thing because somebody's got to see reality and somebody's got to see, look, this would be great. We need to do this first, but that can't be a selfishly focused thing all the time. Yeah. And if, for example, you're concerned that what John and I are talking about isn't illustrated in scripture, hold on. Let me get later into Nehemiah. There's a really interesting part that's pragmatic in this way. They're getting, going to get attacked from the enemy and this is what he says. He says, all right, hold one tool in one hand and a sword in another hand. Half of you are going to defend half. That's very pragmatic understanding the scenario. So there is biblical examples of this. Imagine if someone would have said, well, God said, we're going to rebuild the wall. So no one needs to carry a sword, right? That's a little crazy, right? That's a little crazy. But at the same time, you need to carry a tool because you can say, well, God said the walls are going to get built. Well, magically they're going to get built. He uses his people. And so we need all of those different parts to be more effective, better together. And then we're going to name two more that may feel like, well, how's there any benefit in this? For some of us, seeing clearly means seeing our default that we struggle to engage primarily because of a significant fear of failure, a fear of judgment, a fear of ridicule, a fear of loss, a fear of sacrifice, not just the pain of tattoos, but the pain of significant investment and endeavor and the pain that comes from crushing failure when those things don't pan out the way that we thought. And yet there's a significant value. And it's very similar to the pragmatist of those that are willing to see where things might go wrong and account for it and adjust to not just blaze through with blind optimism of, no, this is all going to go well. We don't need to defend ourselves. God will surely take care. He'll rebuild the walls and protect us. And we just get to sit here in our chairs and watch. But there's also a default. And thankfully, this wasn't Nehemiah's because then nothing would have gotten done. But for some people, the default, the struggle, the difficulty with seeing clearly is that they can't imagine that the thing they're excited about is exactly what God is excited about. They're so accustomed to the thought that I don't have good ideas. I make bad decisions. Other people lead things. Other people start things, that this burning passion in me for something, there's no way that's really what God's after. So if someone asked me that question, John, one of the ways that I would say, okay, let's try to take your faith forward is this. There's a scripture in the Psalms that says, delight yourself also in the Lord and he'll give you the desires of your heart. So let me translate that. It doesn't mean delight yourself in God and he'll give you what you want. It better is translated, delight yourself also in the Lord and he will input, he will give the desires into your heart that you should have. And so backing up sometimes, again, we can, hear me, none of us are perfect in delighting ourselves in God. If someone came to me and maybe that's you, you're thinking right now, how could God be excited when I'm excited about it? I'd back up and go, okay, how have you been delighting with God? How have you been walking with God? And you're like, man, I think my time with God's good. I just don't get this. Or I've been attempting to do that. Well, tell me then why this scripture couldn't be true in your life? Because it says if you, if you want, he'll start putting things in your heart, right? He'll start putting things in your, he'll start there. And that maybe just, maybe you get that first part, walking with him in relationship that way. That is the natural outcome. And sometimes we're surprised when all of a sudden, God, we have something that brings us joy inside. And we're like, well, that can't be God, but he's the God of joy too. Right. And so that is the question that I would ask a backup. How is this going first? And then why can't it be this? I mean, he loves us enough to actually put things, desires in a heart that makes us excited. Right. That may instead of, cause I just think there's, when we say maybe the language is not even good. It's like, what is this? Like I asked this question, you know, what burdens you for God? I don't mean what is a burden of God, right? And that, that language is awesome. Use. I mean, what like gets you, what makes you, you know, and I think sometimes we're like, oh, well God couldn't set me on fire for this. Yes, he can. If he's delighting, you know, so that's what I was trying to say. Not sure if I said it very clearly, especially because for viewers, you'll need to know that John just had to do some miraculous little editing. Cause I messed something up. As you think you're. Okay. Well, and again, maybe this is helpful. You have permission to be passionate about the things that God has made you passionate for. I think so often there's this sense, especially when you start talking about the big things and the kingdom things and the movement of God that we start doing two things at once that shouldn't be possible, but somehow the thoughts go there. It's all up to me and I have to be responsible for everything. All the things that God cares about are things that I need to be involved in. You're not made for that, but why would God put this burden on my heart if I wasn't supposed to do it all the time? Right. That's right. That's the tension. A burden. Yes. Yes. All the burdens. No. And there was a mentor of mine in Brooks that, that just modeled something that was profoundly mature at a time that I think we needed that guidance. And we'd also never heard anybody say it that, you know, several of their friends were getting involved with this particular project locally. And I'm not going to use any specifics whatsoever because I don't want to create any sort of arbitrary like, well, I can't believe they said no, or thank goodness now I don't have to say yes to that either. But there was something that their friends were getting involved in, very ministry focused, very, very practical for the local area. Very meaningful. I mean, this was going to change lives. And this friend of ours said, I love that you all are doing this. I am not going to join you in this because I don't feel like that is something God has called me to. I feel like I'm supposed to do this. And so the social pressure of all of my people are going this way, I don't feel like that's mine. I feel like mine's over here with, with these people. And I can be friends with people that are doing this, but I can be called to this. And this is a weird thing to hear anybody who's employed by a church confess. But the thing that gets me fired up is the people of God that are already in the kingdom that are living less than the abundant life. That's the thing that gets me out of bed. That's the thing that occupies most of my driving thoughts, my shower thoughts, my free time thoughts, is trying to help the people of God that are already in the kingdom experience the abundant life that Jesus died for. Do you know what that means? That I don't spend as much time reaching the people that haven't yet entered the kingdom. And it would be real easy for me to look at that and go, well, I'm supposed to do all of it, right? I'm supposed to be evangelized into the people that, that don't know God while still building up the people that know God and, and by the way, feed the poor and, and clothe the needy and help the widows and the, right? I'm supposed to do all of it and I can't. And if I try to do all of it, I'm going to do none of it well. But you came to that conclusion out of a clear understanding of asking God and him telling you how you're made. Yeah. Not just personal preference. Right. Or comfort. Because what, while Nehemiah is burdened, when we get into the next chapters, the results of him being burdened are actually very challenging for him. He's about to give up a cush job. I mean, he could get killed at any point. That's not so cushy, but I mean, he was way up in the government and he's about to change everything. And I think that had to be clear from God to be able to do that. And I think that is part of what drives so much. That's why we call Ask God the second name of this podcast behind that, because if John said that out of context of asking God, it would seem like he's saying, well, I don't care about the great commission. Right. I get to choose not to. Right. He's actually not saying he has to choose not to, what he's saying is he'll still share his faith. But where God has burdened him is to this aspect of discipling. The people who hear the word should come to life and have life to the full, but aren't experiencing that. God has made him to do that. The things that burden me, like one of the big things that burden me is to be a group of people. That's part of why Nehemiah, not just an individual, that are not overcome with evil, but overcome evil with good. I would love for this place to be known as a place of integrity. I think it is, but I think it wouldn't be hard to go out and find places that have church in their name, that the world that we're called to be salt and light to don't, can point to clear lack of integrity, not lack of differing agreements or morality things, because God teaches our morality, but integrity, says it and does another thing. You know, what does it look like? For me, part of my very nature, how God made me, like if you do like personality tests and all that, is reformer. That's how God made me, and so I'm naturally drawn to things like, God, how do you use me uniquely in this calling to reform something greater through your help with other people? So what does that mean? That means that there are other really, really good things that other churches might do or other individuals might do that I don't do. And that's okay, because God has made us, back to Acts 17, uniquely for a place and a time, and we've got to know that. And this is really, I think we can't miss that. God already knew how he made Nehemiah, and there's a good chance that Nehemiah was already at some level, had a little bit of a spark. God is still a whole lot of gasoline, because it's just convenient, and I'm using that word somewhat sarcastically, that Nehemiah's brother, whether it was his real brother or just someone who refers to his brother as a debate, comes and tells him the story. But you know it was in him already. He's like, hey, tell me what's going on. Tell me what's going on. He wanted to know. He wanted to know, and God put that together. And so know this, that God's probably already planted in you, if you haven't felt it yet, how he's made you in something that he wants to ignite. Are we open to it? Are we aware of the rounding situation? So that when he brings, you know, all the different things that need to happen to make fire, what is it? You know, fuel, spark, and air, I think, something like that. I don't know. Science class wasn't my best. You know, when he brings the air or the spark, it ignites with the fuel that's already in you. Yeah. So again, this isn't permission to go where it's comfortable or convenient, because Nehemiah is made wildly uncomfortable, but he's following this burning passion that he has then sought extensively to have clarified by God. So having done that, spend some time. What ignites your heart? What ache for the kingdom has God placed in you? Specifically, what dream, what desire has God placed in you that cannot be accomplished on your own for something greater? God assembles large groups of people, each one personally committed to following the call in their life, each one personally committed to hearing what God is saying to them, but pursuing a course together collectively. What are the dreams and desires that God has placed on your heart for his kingdom that cannot, that could never be accomplished on your own? Spend some time sitting there, and again, notice the defaults. Do you notice if you're pulling away from some things because it would actually require you to engage with large numbers of people, and people are messy? Introverts of the world unite separately, and in their own spaces, and yet notice that God booby traps life by refusing to allow us to remain in isolation, by refusing to allow the major movements of God and of the kingdom to be accomplished entirely by a single individual with no involvement by others. We have to learn to engage with others if we're going to discover the realization of the desires of our heart. And so just recognize, again, where there's a temptation to believe, I'm good right where I am. I'm good with something less than. I'm good with doing what I can out of self-sufficiency. One of the things that came to mind as I was thinking about this was, one, just how often I've been guilty of that, no, no, no, I'll take care of it. I'll take care of it. I can handle this. I don't want to bother other people. I don't want to burden other people. I don't want to trouble other people. And the number of times that I've then actually prevented people from getting involved with something that could have become larger than I allowed it to be because I was most comfortable operating in independence, and I thought it was good. There's a section in Revelation 3 that God will bring to mind somewhat often, and you may know parts or even all of it, but it's the message to the church in Laodicea. And the first part is, you're lukewarm, you're neither hot nor cold, I'll spit you out. But the part that really grips me is right after that verse, verse 17, Jesus saying to the church, you say, we're rich. We have everything we want. We don't need a thing. And you don't realize that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked. He's saying to a group of people that seemingly have all the bases covered, you actually don't have anything because what I'm offering you is this. And if you're listening to the audio, the hands are stretched up and really far apart. And what you're believing is sufficient and more than sufficient is this teeny tiny infinitesimal amount of what I'm actually inviting you into. And so Jesus goes on to say, I advise you to buy gold from me. You think you have wealth, buy gold from me, gold that's been purified by fire, then you'll be rich. Right? I'm not saying don't be rich. I'm saying, let me show you what real, what real riches look like. Also buy white garments from me. You think you're well clothed. I have something better for you. So you will not be shamed by your nakedness, ointment for your eyes. So you will be able to see, you think you're seeing clearly going right back to the beginning of this episode. I have something that will help you. Would you like to see clearly? I correct and discipline everyone I love, so be diligent and turn from your indifference. Look, I stand at the door and knock. If you hear my voice and open the door, I will come in and we will share a meal together as friends. The invitation is always to come together. You and Jesus, and then all the other one and Jesus to form a whole that can accomplish something so much greater. And I think as I've been processing that, and we sort of talk about like, where has this sort of tyranny, the urgent take priority over God's invitation. You reminded me when you went to the churches, the seven churches in Revelation, about the section to Ephesus and John writes, this one thing I have against you, that you lost your first love. What's interesting is if John wrote that, I believe about 94 AD from the Isle of Patmos. The epistle to Ephesus written, same church, by the way, written by the apostle Paul was roughly somewhere between AD 60 to AD 62, so we're talking 32 to 34 years. When you look at the epistle Paul wrote, it is almost exclusively without correction. You look at Corinthians, Corinthians is made up of correction. You guys are jacking this up. It's almost exclusively without correction, right? And it seems in many ways to be a model of what it looks like to be a great community. 32 years later, not long, they lost their first love. How did that happen, right? I mean, again, like the people who went back, I think they went back for a good reason. How did that happen? I think how we lose our first love, how we become some ways that we don't intend to be and our faith isn't as vibrant and we lose the fact that we're better together is the tyranny of the urgent. And I was just talking to you about this the other day, I think it was you, we'll say it was you. I realized I spent about four or five years while we were, this building as we're putting this building together, and then immediately after the building, the pandemic hit, spending is what Stephen Covey would say in the top left corner in all the urgent things. And not that there aren't plenty urgent, but that tyranny of the urgent over a period of about four or five years became, in my opinion, beyond something I had to do, that's something that I started just living there so that I didn't know how to be in the top right corner. Like this is urgent, but this is most important. This matters, but this is most important because my hair was on fire for five straight years. Whether it needed to be is a whole different discussion, but it was so that even when I can't even look at my life anymore and give you good reasons why I should be on fire, I was just constantly living out of the tyranny of the urgent. I'm still trying to get out of it. I'm still trying to figure out what that looks like, but I never started there. I never wanted to be there. That wasn't my intent. In fact, a lot of things I was doing was well intended, but over time it became a replacement for what it is to be better, listen to God, be willing to wait and that. And so I think lots of times we see problems, we see things, they're so urgent and we know we, because there's some things just clear. We always say, ask God, but there's some things we know, Hey, we don't really have to pray about. Yeah. Right. God's already made it clear. Yep. Right. You may have to pray about how to love your neighbor, but you don't have to pray about whether you should love your neighbor. You don't have to pray about whether they should love them, maybe just how. So you need to do that stuff. But I think that what happens is we get caught in the tyranny sometimes that we, we just forget and we start then all of a sudden without even realizing it, putting our things. This is what God wants me to do. This is how I'm supposed to focus. And we miss the invitation of God. And the next thing we look up, it's 12 years later at minimum, there's no walls built. It's you know, 30 some years later, you've left your first love. And how did that happen? Because you know, almost nothing negative was said to you 30 years before. And now that's your indictment. So there's something about looking at our lives, maybe backing up, looking at our calendars, have a want to be asking God, inviting me into this process, like where had these seemingly and in many ways, not seemingly are good things that were necessary and needed. Maybe at the time turned into something that it isn't healthy now in my relationship with you. Yeah. Yeah. I think something else that I've noticed, the tyranny of the urgent stealing is the larger dreams. And in some cases, you knew what the larger dream was. And in some cases, the hair on fire day to day distracted you. But in some cases, the larger dreams became painful. And the tyranny of the urgent, the hair on fire and the day to day became a way of avoiding the pain of the bigger dreams. You know, we were talking and I didn't know this until I realized if, you know, we're going to spend the next 10 weeks on Nehemiah, I should probably read it again because it's been a minute. And I was watching a video that taught me that Ezra and Nehemiah used to be a combined book before they were separated. Nehemiah was an appendix on the end of Ezra. And so I went back and read Ezra and Nehemiah. And when they go back to build the temple, to rebuild the temple prior to Nehemiah, there's this subset of the population that's actually dismayed and grieving because it's not what they remembered it as. It didn't live up to what they had known. And so the dream that they had harbored all of these years in captivity or in exile or remaining but separated from their people was that someday it's going to get rebuilt and it's going to be as good or better as it was before. And feeling like, well, this didn't live up to expectations. And so now what do I do with that? And Proverbs 13 talks about the pain, the pain that comes from hope deferred. It says hope deferred makes the heart sick. And it does. And any of us that have lived with, but God, I thought you were going to, and it didn't pan out that way, understands the toll that that takes on the heart, sometimes even our physical bodies, that hope deferred makes the heart sick. But that particular proverb finishes with, but a dream fulfilled is a tree of life. And in some cases we've gotten so comfortable with just allowing the hope deferred to stay deferred that we've given up on seeing hope realized. We've given up on engaging with God to see things actually take form and become a tree of life. And so recognize that about yourself. If there's this burning thing inside of you, you feel like God is prompting, is stoking even, but your response is, but God, I thought you were going to this other time and this other time and you didn't, or it didn't live up to expectation and I'm not sure I can handle the disappointment again. Then one of the things that needs to happen as far as seeing clearly is that before you either begrudgingly start doing the next thing or just keep building your own house and refuse to rebuild the walls because nope, you had your shot, God, is to invite God into that place of pain to talk to you about the disappointment and to bring healing to that part of your heart that is fairly convinced of a reality of who God is and who you are and what's true about the world around you that may actually be standing in the way of a very legitimate thing that God has placed in your heart for such a time as this. Yeah. Well, and then lastly, I mean, this be quick, but I don't mean to diminish it in his quickness. When Nehemiah went to pray, he recognized that God was calling him to do something. But before God wanted the work of his hands, he wanted the disposition of his heart. And I think a lot of times, you know, we've maybe stepped out trying to do something for God, and maybe it's not happening yet or maybe because God wants to talk to us about something different. You know, the reason that so much was happening in Jerusalem was because God was fulfilling the promise of Deuteronomy 28 to 32. And Nehemiah knew that, and so he came and he confessed that and confession, and then he repented for himself. He he couldn't repent for the whole nation they had on that. But then he, as the leader that God had appointed, had brought then brings it to the whole nation and the whole nation then eventually repents. There's a time later on in the book of Nehemiah where that's the case. But, you know, maybe God wants before anything to change the way we think. That's repentance, right? And we've shared that many times. You know, it's thinking differently. But just in case you think it's just about thinking, thinking differently should produce different actions. And this is what he knew and this is what he went back to. And so if you're thinking that maybe this is something that's going on in your life, you're not sure. Maybe God wants to talk about change your heart. Maybe there's a place of repentance. Maybe there's a place of, you know, I was thinking about the five years and my hair was on fire. There's a whole lot of things I could say about that, but I'm pretty sure at some point or another, I started acting from an internal thought process I wasn't even aware of. And that was it. Like, if I don't run around with my hair on fire, this is all going to fall apart. And well, God, you put me here and this has to happen. So I and I never bothered to ask God, is this all going to fall apart? Because I know intellectually that it wouldn't. It's on him. But there was that sort of tension. And so I had to have a moment later on that seems really weird to repent from doing good things. Because I did good things out of the wrong heart disposition. So you may go, I don't have any bad things in my life. Like we could look at the Israelites and say all this. That's OK. There are good things. We could be doing that aren't God things because we're doing that to replace his guidance or doing a place. We try to be in control, which is my big issue. I talk about a lot or whatever it might be that he wants to draw into it. And those for me in my own life, John, maybe those are ones that really like, oh, oh, that was super subtle. That was super. No wonder my my faith walk is not the way it should be or that because these things have kind of snuck in. Never started that way with a real big sign. Hey, I'm a bad thing. You know, it started a different way. And so I really when you realize it's time for a change, don't miss the part what Nehemiah did. Nehemiah, we're going to talk about next week. He prays for four months before he approaches the king. But the first prayer he prays is not how should I approach? When should I approach and what should I do? Was God, I repent. We repent from because I recognize what is happening is because of these things where we've not done this. And maybe just maybe that's a place for you to consider today, too. So hopefully things are stirring, hopefully some big things that cannot be accomplished by you alone that can't even be accomplished by you and God together are stirring. You are needed. You are absolutely needed, and the things that God has placed on your heart are needed. And so thank you for being a part of this larger group that together is attempting to follow the things that God has placed in our heart. So that we can not only know him, but we can see him and the coming of his kingdom. Yeah. So as always, thanks for being a part of this journey with us. Thanks for letting us be a part of your journey. And yeah, don't forget Avengers Assemble. That's right. On your left.
