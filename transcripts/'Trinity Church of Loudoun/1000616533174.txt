Would Abraham actually die? The curse of death has now come to all ever since Genesis 3 in the fall in the garden. But God has now singled out this one man and entered into for the first time entered into a covenant with him. God has become Abraham's friend. God has made Abraham the object and the possessor of all of his promises. By faith in the great God, Abraham has, as we journeyed with him, escaped Pharaohs and kings, conquered foreign invading kings, talked with God, dined with God, fathered a son and he in Sarah's old age and learned that God will always provide a lamb. He's really old now. And at some point you had to wonder, is he actually going to die? Is God's covenant partner going to die? This morning, we arrive at our answer. As Moses records in Genesis 25, Abraham's death. But that's actually not quite the point of this passage or the argument that Moses is making in Genesis 25. The point of this passage, I'm going to give it to you right up front, is that God's blessing outlives death. God's blessing outlives death. The point of chapter 25 is, yes, there's something even stronger than death. You can think of all that's happened so far from Genesis 3 on, ever since the curse has entered into the world. All of Genesis is crying out. All of creation is crying out, begging the question, is there anything stronger than death? Which comes to all. Genesis 25 gives us a resounding yes. Yes, there is something even stronger than death. You can observe, if you have your Bible open, and I hope you do, to Genesis chapter 25. There's a very simple structure to our passage. We have a death right in the middle, verses 7 through 10. And Abraham actually dies in verse 8, as Moses records it. But on each of the sides of this death in the middle, we have two little genealogies. You see, there's a genealogy at the beginning of Keturah's children, and then a genealogy at the end of our passage this morning of Ishmael's offspring. And so we have a death surrounded on either side by two little genealogies. And our outline this morning, if you're a note-taker, want to follow along and know where I'm going, is time-based. It's chronological, because that's how this passage works. We have, in verses 1 through 6, Abraham's final years. In verses 7 through 10, Abraham's death. And then in verses 11 through 18, life after Abraham. That's how this passage works. That's how we're going to look at it. And so let's dive into Genesis one last time before we take another long break to return to the third and final installation of the Genesis trilogy, 25 through 50, sometime later in the future, months or years or decades from now, God willing. And this morning, we'll finish the story of Abraham. So first, let's look at Abraham's final years in verses 1 through 6. Verse 1 says, chapter 25, verse 1, Abraham took another wife whose name was Keturah. Sarah is gone. And Abraham, who was 10 years her senior, lived on another 38 years, if you do the math, after Sarah's death. And after some time, Abraham got lonely. Or maybe seeing his beloved son Isaac finally take a bride for himself and Rebekah, maybe seeing that reawakened in Abraham, those old feelings and longings for a companion. Whatever the case, we don't know. Moses doesn't tell us. At some point, Abraham took a new wife named Keturah. You'll notice in the passage here, she's called a wife, but later in the passage, she's called Abraham's concubine. And actually later in the Bible, when it refers back to this passage, it again refers to Keturah as one of Abraham's concubine. So that might be confusing to you, but concubines in the Bible, that word and that idea, that title carries a broad range of meaning. But it always consists of these two things. First of all, concubines contained a secondary status to the wife. And second of all, concubines in the Old Testament are almost always associated with childbearing and with the birth of children. And so here in the case of Abraham, he has two concubines. Hagar before, we've already heard her story. And now after Sarah's death, Keturah. They are both Abraham's wives, but they will forever, for all of history to this day as I'm preaching, contain a secondary status to Sarah, who was Abraham's beloved, who was the wife of promise and the wife who along with Abraham inherited all the promises of God. And also in this passage, we see that Abraham's new wife, Keturah, like most concubines in the Bible, is associated with bearing children. In verses 2 and 3, you can see that we get another little genealogy as Keturah bore Abraham's six sons. And then her sons have sons. So you can see all these names. Zimron and Jochshon and Midian and Ishbak and Shua. And then those sons have sons. Sheba and Dedan and Asherim and Latushim and Lumenin and Ephah and Ephor. And I know Ethan already pronounced them all for us, and I don't have any further idea how to pronounce them than he does. But I'm reading them again and repeating them, hoping some of these names will lodge into your brain for what I'm going to show you in just a few minutes. Abraham has more sons from Keturah, a new genealogy. Six more sons and then more sons after that. Just like that. Abraham takes a new wife. I'll bet most of you, if you're honest, didn't know her name before five seconds ago, Keturah. Abraham takes a wife, a new wife, Keturah. And as the text reads, it's almost like five seconds later and without any thought or delay, he has six sons, just like that. After 25 years of waiting with Sarah for the promised son. Isn't that interesting? It was striking reading that, thinking about this, how Moses just glosses over it, and he has six more sons. How do you think Abraham processed that positive pregnancy test? I bet he laughed. I bet he laughed like Sarah's last laugh at the goodness of God. At the goodness of the God who opens and closes wombs and who used a 25 year agonizing delay to teach Abraham who he was and what he was like and how deeply he could trust him. There are things that God has withheld from you. I'm sure of it. You could all testify if I gave you a microphone. There are things that you wanted, you longed for, you prayed for, you begged God for, that God withheld from you for years, for months, for seasons, and then sometime later, to your great surprise, he gave you in another season. How many of you could give that testimony? And I hope you learned in that waiting season how to more deeply rely upon God and how to find your rest in him. Surely Abraham did. In verse 5, we read that Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac. So Abraham's will, so to speak, assigned his entire considerable inheritance. Remember, he's rich. He's a wealthy man and all of his inheritance was assigned to Isaac because he, Isaac, was the promised child with whom God's blessing went, which was the hope for all the nations. But verse 6 says, if you look at verse 6, that to the sons of his concubines, that is Keturah and Hagar, Abraham also gave gifts. And while he was still living, he sent them away from his son Isaac eastward to the east country. We see here, Abraham loves his other sons and he's favorable to them as he loved Ishmael before, much before, when he sent Ishmael away with gifts and very much love and sadness in parting. And yet he sends them away. And he sends them, Moses says, eastward. I don't know if you remember this, but east and eastward in Genesis is always a sign of trouble. In Genesis chapter 3, after Adam and Eve sin, they're banished from the Garden of Eden and doomed by God. They're driven east, Genesis 3.24 says. After Cain murders his brother Abel, he was, like Adam and Eve, again driven away from the presence of the Lord east of Eden, 4.16 says. Still later, a bunch of people settled in the east and erected the Tower of Babel, Genesis 11 verse 2 says. East in Genesis always represents moving away from the blessing of God and into the land of judgment. And here are all of Abraham's sons, save Isaac, leaving the Promised Land to travel eastward. And yet it's not the end of the story, even the end of their story, and all hope is not lost, even for them. Isaiah, the prophet Isaiah prophesied, you don't have to turn there, but in Isaiah chapter 60, the culmination of his book, where he looks forward to the final day of God's blessing, where he'll make all things new. Isaiah in chapter 60 prophesied that a day would come where the earth would be covered in darkness, but the glory of God would dawn upon this darkness and a day of salvation would come. In Isaiah's prophecy, God says this, Isaiah chapter 60 verse 3. Nations, watch this, nations shall come to your light. Kings, foreign kings shall gather to the brightness of your rising. Lift up your eyes all around and see they all gather together. They're all coming to you, God. Your sons shall come from afar and your daughters, verse 4 says, you shall see and be radiant. Your heart shall thrill and exult, verse 5 says. A multitude of camels shall cover you. Remember camels are exotic, expensive animals associated with wealth. Abraham had lots of camels. Camels shall cover you. The young camels of Midian and Ephah. All those from Sheba, verse 6 says, shall come and they shall come bringing gold and frankincense and shall bear good news or gospel and shall bear the praises of the Lord. Isaiah spoke of a day, chapter 60, where the nations were covered in darkness, would see the light and would worship the Lord and would come in bringing good news and singing God's praises. Isaiah is prophesying of the day of salvation, the day of the Lord. And did you recognize the names that will come in from the nations to this day of the Lord and see the light and fall before God and sing his praises? Midian, Ephah, Sheba, those are Keturah's sons. Abraham's other children, the ones he sent away to the land of judgment and outside of the blessing. They're here coming back for salvation. I read this week one great Old Testament scholar, now deceased, commented on this passage. In God's plan, these sons of Keturah were sent away that there might be a true home made for them to return to. Jesus said, Matthew 8, verse 11, I tell you, many will come from the east and from the west and recline at the table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. Aren't you thankful for the wisdom of God and for the expanse of his mercy? God often takes what we might call the scenic route and we can look at his directions and question his choices and cry out, this isn't fair and why this way God and why me and trust that we know better. But doesn't God know what he's doing? And doesn't he know so much better than us? And don't we have a thousand evidences in the Bible and in our lives that he works all things together for our good and for his glory. Secondly, I want you to look with me at Abraham's death in verses 7 through 10. Abraham's death. Genesis is marked out by the author in chapters. Now, I'm not talking about our chapters. Those are very useful, but those weren't put there 24 and 25 where we are. These verses, the little numbers, those weren't put there by Moses. Moses wrote his story and broke it up into chapters as well, but his chapters are marked by a different phrase and a very specific phrase and the phrase is this, these are the generations of. Do you remember that? So it's a book of many chapters and each chapter is marked ending and beginning with these are the generations of. So there are chapters, we've already covered chapters of the generations of the heavens and the earth. That's Genesis 1 and 2. There are chapters for Adam and for Noah and for Shem and for many others. Since January, I've been preaching out of one chapter in Moses' book, really, and it's actually the chapter of Terah, who is Abraham's dad. So if you look back, if you flip over to Genesis chapter 11, let me show you this really quickly. 11 verse 27 says, now these are the generations of Terah and Terah fathered Abraham. Do you see that? That's the marking in Genesis of a new beginning of a new chapter. Now, if you flip over back to our passage and one verse past where I'm wrapping up this morning, so Genesis 25, 19, we read, these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son. So do you see that marks a new, that's the ending and a beginning. We're now leaving Terah's chapter, which is really Abraham's chapter and beginning a new one, a new chapter break. So what I'm preaching this morning is the very end of the longest chapter in Genesis, and I think one of the most important sections in all of the Bible, in the story of Abraham. And here in verses 7 through 10, his story and his life comes to a close. These are the days, verse 7 says, of the years of Abraham's life, 175 years. And Abraham breathed his last and died in a good old age, an old man and full of years and was gathered to his people. God, you'll remember, called Abraham out of Ur of the Chaldeans when Abraham was 75 years old. Here, Moses says, he breathes his last at 175 years old. So do the math, the kids can handle this one. His journey with God was exactly how long? How long did Abraham follow God and the voice of God? Adults can help out as well. 100 years, exactly 100 years, what a life. And then verse 8 says, curiously, that he was gathered to his people. So he lives 100 years and his death here is peaceful and at a good old age, Moses says, he's an old man and full of years. By the way, that's exactly as God had promised back in chapter 15, verse 15. As for you, God told Abraham, you shall go to your fathers in peace and you shall be buried in a good old age. Even God's friends, yes, must face the curse of death. We do learn that here. But even in death, God fulfills his every promise to Abraham. Isn't that wonderful? Even in death, promises are being checked off and fulfilled. And then verse 8 says, curiously, that he was gathered to his people. Abraham was gathered to his people. Now, you might read that at a glance as noting where Abraham was buried. So he was buried somewhere along with gathered unto all of his people. But that's actually not true. If you look at what Genesis teaches, he wasn't buried back in Ur along with all of his ancestors. He was buried with Sarah in the cave of Machpelah in the promised land. And there were no other people there. He was not gathered unto his people. He was gathered to his wife's bones. And that's it for now. So it's I just want you to see it's a strange phrase. And we certainly couldn't develop any kind of extensive theology of the afterlife from this one phrase. But I just want you to see it's suggestive. It's hinting that there's life beyond death. It's even suggestive, I would say, that there's fellowship beyond death. He was gathered to his people. It's a strange phrase, but it's pregnant with hope and meaning. Hope and meaning which would burst forth in time with the resurrection. We know from the rest of the Bible that when Abraham died, he went to a place called Sheol, the grave, the waiting place of the dead. And there Abraham waited along with all the saints, trusting in God and trusting in his promises by faith, waiting for God to redeem him. When you die, the Bible teaches that you, after Jesus, after the cross, after the resurrection, you will instantly, instantaneously go to one of two places. A place the Bible calls Gehenna or hell, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth. A place reserved for all those who have rejected Christ and God's one offer of salvation in Christ by trusting him and in his name and taking his blood to cover you and wash you of your sins and taking him for your king. For all those who have rejected, they'll go to hell, the Bible says. That's sobering. But secondly, the other place, many of us will go immediately into the presence of Christ, where there is fullness of life and joy everlasting, where there is fellowship with all the people of God. And also where there is Abraham, who has now received his full reward. I sincerely hope that if you're here this morning and you've not yet placed your faith in Jesus, I would invite you to do so now. He bars none who come to him in faith, none. It doesn't matter who you've been, doesn't matter who you are, doesn't matter what you've done. All who take Jesus as savior and follow him as king are permitted to paradise forever. And I would invite you to do that even now. Verse nine says, if you'll look there, Isaac and Ishmael, Abraham's sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah in the field of Ephron, the son of Zohar, the Hittite, east of Mamre, the field that Abraham purchased from the Hittites. There Abraham was buried and Sarah, his wife. It's really a beautiful scene here. Isaac is 75. What a fast forward here in his life. Ishmael is probably 90 or so. Who knows how long it's been since they've seen each other before this moment. Isaac must have gotten word out somehow to his estranged brother, his estranged half-brother, alerting him that their dad has died. And so the half-brothers here for a moment reunite after all these years to bury their legendary father. They meet, of course, where else would they meet? But the cave of Machpelah, which Abraham had secured 38 years before. Abraham, and now Isaac's, one piece of the promised land. One piece of property in the land of which God has promised to give all of it to them. This is all they've got. And now Isaac and Ishmael together bury their dad. I wonder what they said to each other. I performed Sarah's eulogy a couple of weeks ago. I would do the same for Abraham, but I won't steal the honor since it's already been done by the author of Hebrews. And so I'll read for you now Hebrews 11 and Hebrews final word on Abraham, the man of faith. By faith, verse 8 says, by faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance. And he went out not knowing where he was going. By faith, he went to live in the land of promise. As in a foreign land, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs with him of the same promise. For he was looking forward to the city that has foundations, whose designer and builder is God. And by faith, Sarah herself received power to conceive, even when she was past the age since she considered him faithful who had promised. And therefore from one man, Abraham, and him as good as dead, were born descendants as many as the stars of heaven and as many as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore. You remember those were the promises God made to Abraham? Sand and stars. Look at the stars. As many as you can count, so shall your descendants be. Hebrews is saying done. These all died in faith, not having received the things promised, but having seen them and greeted them from afar and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth. This is Abraham's life and his legacy, a legacy of faith. He went out into the unknown and he did it by faith. He fell down into sin. How many times do we watch Father Abraham play the fool and fall back into the same old sins? But he got back up by faith. He received the great promises of God and then he waited and waited and waited by faith and then he died in faith. And here lies Abraham, earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, lying in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life to come. Abraham is dead. But the story goes on and Moses, sometimes with the flair for dramatics, other times not at all. Moses does not linger here because again, Abraham's death is not actually the point of this passage. So look with me finally at verses 11 through 18. One final scene I want to show you. Life after Abraham. Life after Abraham. In this afterword which Moses gives us to Abraham's death, Moses wants you to know two things. Two things. First of all, Ishmael, Abraham's first born son, but not the son of the promise. Ishmael also became a nation. So Moses shows us here that Ishmael also fathered 12 sons. And by the way, in genealogies like these, 12 often represents, it's symbolic of a nation. It's not just 12 random kids. This represents a nation. So think about the 12 tribes of Israel. That's the nation of Israel. And so Ishmael here fathers 12 and himself becomes a nation. Exactly, by the way, as God had already earlier mercifully promised Ishmael. Genesis 17 verse 20. As for Ishmael, I have heard you. He's heard Hagar and Abraham's cries. I've heard you. Behold, I have blessed him and I will make him fruitful and multiply him greatly as well. He shall father 12 princes and I will make him also into a great nation. God has been true to his word, even blessing Ishmael, who isn't the child of promise, who does not possess the blessing. And so we read here, Moses records that Ishmael's tribes, his offspring, move out and they settle towards Assyria and in the desert regions and become what we know today as the Arab peoples. Did Ishmael ever take his father's God for his God? We don't know. The Bible is silent about his faith. And so who on earth knows? But I do know this, as has often been said, when we get to paradise with God, there will no doubt surely be many people who we expected and assumed to be there, who are not there, which is very sobering. But there will also be no doubt many others who are there, who we just could not have imagined they possibly could have made it there. Why? Because God must have done a surprising work upon their hearts and given faith in unexpected places. And because God's mercy really is that vast and that unbelievable. And of course, most surprising of all, that we should find ourselves there forgiven for our sins and removed of all of our sorrows, all because of Christ, debtors to his mercy alone, all of us. Amen. Second, Moses wants you to know that Isaac, the child of God's promise, did receive the blessing. Look at verse 11. After the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac, his son, and Isaac settled at Beer Lahai Roy. Now, this is the same place you might remember in southern Canaan, in the Promised Land, where we found Isaac, last chapter, out in the open skies, meditating in the fields, mourning his mother's loss, and then encountering and meeting his wife-to-be, Rebekah. So this was Isaac's place, his special spot. And God blessed him, Moses says. This means more than God took care of him and gave him good health and many years and good wealth and happiness. That's not what this is talking about. This is talking about something so much more than that. I hope you know that from traveling through Genesis. This blessing is so much more than health and wealth and happiness. Remember, one last time, the promises God made to Abraham, one last time, what were they? Three promises. People, place, and blessing. Three big mountain promises God made to Abraham, beginning in chapter 12, then again in chapter 15, and then 17, and repeated again and again and again. People, place, and blessing. Blessing. Blessing. Genesis 12, verse three, I will bless those, God told Abraham, who bless you, and I will curse those who curse you. And in you, Abraham, all the families, all the nations of the earth shall be blessed. In you, Abraham, all the other nations shall find their way into my blessing. This blessing, Isaac receiving the blessing, is about that blessing. Are you with me? Genesis 12, three blessing. This is about people place, blessing. This blessing is everything, and Isaac has the blessing. Isaac has inherited Abraham's promises. People, place, blessing has now been passed down to Isaac. The promises of Abraham are now Isaac's. The promises of Adam and Eve, of a seed who would come from the woman to crush the head of the serpent and make things right again, have now passed down to Isaac. Abraham is dead, but God is very much alive, and so hope is alive. And so the show goes on, and let this serve as a reminder to all of us even here this morning, none of us are indispensable to the work of God and to the story of God. None of us, not even Abraham, even Father Abraham, God's friend and God's man, the man of faith par excellence as the New Testament talks about him. Even his death does not interrupt or even slow for a second the mighty work of God in salvation. We should all serve God and serve him with everything we have, and more and more as we progress through life because we want to know him. As the Apostle Paul says, I want to know him in the power of his resurrection. And part of our service in investing is investing in the next generation. That's part of how we serve God and how we know God is we invest in the ones who are up next, that they too might know of the great promise-keeping God in whom is blessing and salvation because all of our days are numbered. And unless Christ returns, there will come a day where we too are gone and our kids must engage with God and our grandkids must engage with God and lead churches and speak on behalf of God and evangelize the neighborhoods and the nations. It will be their turn next. And so it's for us to make the same investment that Abraham made to Isaac. Our days are short, even shorter than Abraham's, but God is vast and what a joy to be lost in something so much bigger than ourselves. Abraham's dead, but the show goes on because as I said at the start, God's blessing outlives even death. God's blessing is stronger than death. Abraham died in faith, having inherited the promises of God, at least in part. Think about it. People. People place blessing. People. Isaac is here and he's alive and well. And honestly, for that matter, even Abraham's other sons, the sons of Keturah and the sons of Hagar and Ishmael, they're becoming nations. So people, Abraham has indeed become a nation and is becoming really nations. Place. Abraham's sole stake in the promised land as he dies is a graveyard. The cave of Machpelah. It's not much, but he has a stake. God has fulfilled his promise. He has a place in the promised land. And blessing. Abraham knew the speaking God. As a friend, he knew his voice. We could say in the truest sense that Abraham was a blessed man, a most blessed man. God gave him a taste in his life. And by the time of his death, God gave him a taste of each of these promises. And yet you have to see this. As he dies, as the author of Hebrews reminded us from where I read earlier, he died in faith, not yet having fully received the things promised, but only having greeted them from afar. He touched them, but didn't hold them. If only Abraham could have seen the rest of the story and the end, the finale, the culmination of all these promises, people, place, blessing. Actually, Jesus said, John chapter 8, Abraham rejoiced to see my day. Jesus said that he saw it and was glad. So maybe in a real way, Abraham did see it, but he saw it by faith. What would he have seen? Had he seen it all? What would he have? What would he have inherited? What is he looking at now? As God has come through finally on all of his promises. People. People. Not just the nation of Israel. Every tribe, tongue and nation. All those who share Abraham's faith and call upon the same God through the same son, the Lord Jesus Christ. Revelation 7. After this, I looked and behold a great multitude that no one could number from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, all standing before the throne and before the lamb, clothed in white robes with palm branches in their hands and all crying out with a loud voice. Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne and to the lamb. People. If only Abraham could have seen. Place. Place. Not just the promised land. A new heaven and a new earth. Revelation 21. And behold, I looked and saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. Place. He will dwell with them and they will be his people and God himself will be with them as their God. Place. Imagine if Abraham only knew all of it would be renewed. Heaven and earth married together as one and all of it given to the saints, given to Abraham. And about that blessing. People, place, blessing. That blessing passed from Abraham down to Isaac. And then it carries on in the story of the blessing, really carries on through the entire rest of your Bible. It's a wild journey, the story of this blessing with lots of surprises and even detours as God in a way that only God would do, chooses a special line through whom to show his favor, his blessing through whom he's going to bless the nations and save people from every tribe, tongue, and nation. So not Eliezer of Damascus. Remember him when he was a candidate for just a moment? No, not Ishmael. Isaac. Finally, the blessing. And then Esau. Spoiler. No, not Esau. Jacob, the trickster inherits the blessing. Isaac, Jacob. And then Jacob's 12 sons, the 12 tribes of Israel. But it has to be Joseph, right? The whole rest of the stories about Joseph. It has to be right. Joseph, doesn't it? No. Surprise. Genesis 49. Judah, the lion, inherits the blessing. And on and on and on, the weird and wild story of the blessing travels this winding path, taking detours through Moab. What's the blessing doing in Moab with a Moabites named Ruth? It travels to prostitutes like Rahab. What? Until at last it lands. And at long last, it reaches its final destination in Bethlehem. And in a young girl, a virgin named Mary, and in her child, who is the seed of the woman and who has the blessing of Abraham, the Lord Jesus Christ. He has God's blessing. That's not quite right. He is God's blessing. He is it. He's not God's friend like Abraham. He's God's son. He's like Abraham, but he's far greater. He also lives by faith, but he never falls down. He never sins. And like Abraham, shockingly, even he meets death. As he was killed, crucified even. And once again, the blessing is buried in a grave. But this time, it was different and even far different from Abraham. And I'll let Jesus' good friend, Peter, tell you how and why this time it was so different. Men of Israel, Peter preaches in Acts chapter 2 at Pentecost. Men of Israel, hear these words. Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst. As you yourselves know, this Jesus delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God. You crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men. But God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death. Why? Because it was not possible for him to be held by it. It was not possible for death to hold this one down because God is alive and stronger than death and death has been conquered by the blessing of God. Jesus is alive. And so Abraham is alive. And now when I die, somehow I'll be more fully alive. And so will you. If you've believed in Jesus and found Abraham's blessing, which is stronger than death. Let's pray. God, thank you for Abraham and these journeys with Abraham and how unlike us he is. Great warrior king who spoke with you as one speaks with a friend and as one speaks with a man beside him, hearing his voice and yet is so like us and so relatable, always falling down, always doing the same foolish things and yet enduring and most of all like us and carried along entirely and solely by the grace of God. By your power. God, we pray that you would take the story of Abraham and strengthen faith in each of us and give us faith like you gave to Abraham. And God, we pray too, as we read in James, that you would give us works that accompany faith like Abraham and attest to us and to the world that we really are your children as we look more and more like you. And so God, would you would you change us? Would you strengthen us? Would you awaken faith? Would you strengthen faith? Would you cause faith to endure even until our dying day? And we pray all these things in Jesus name. Amen.
