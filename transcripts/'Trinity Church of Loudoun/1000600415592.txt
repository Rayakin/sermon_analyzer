If you have a Bible, go ahead and turn with me to Genesis chapter 15. And on the matter of doubt, we have a good gift from God's Word to doubters this morning. So if that's you, if you're, and all of us in different ways and at different times struggle with different forms of doubt, a good gift from God for all of us to deal with our doubts this morning in Genesis 15. So Genesis 15, we'll dive right in as we continue our journeys with Abram. If you're new with us this morning or visiting with us maybe for the first time, we're just journeying through Genesis. And right now we're in the part of Genesis where God is dealing with Abram. And Abram has been promised three specific things by God. Now if you've been here, I've been testing you on this week after week. So the three things that God has promised to Abram are what? People, place, and blessing. Three promises beginning in Genesis chapter 12, God has given to and is calling upon Abram to bank all of his hopes on people, place, and blessing. Now last week, or two weeks ago rather, at the passage just before the one we pick up this morning, God has just taken Abram out underneath the starry skies and confirmed his promise for a people, for a seed. So if you remember Genesis 15, one through six, Eleazar of Damascus, this random household servant, we don't know anything else about that, he shall not be your servant, Abram, God told him. And so he invites him out underneath the dark canopy of cloudy, starry skies and he tells Abram, count all the stars, and when Abram gets to a number so high that he can't count anymore, God promises to him, so shall your descendant be. So thou shall your descendants be. You will have an heir from your very own body. Abram's gonna have a child, even in his old age. So last time, people confirmed. Well this morning, back in the passage, Abram wants more. Abram believed the Lord, we read at the end of last week's passage, and it was counted to him as righteousness, that's Genesis 15, verse six. People confirmed. In this morning's passage, Abram turns to place, that other promise of God, land. What about that, God? So you look at verse seven, you can see there, as we just read, God said to him, I am the Lord who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans to give to you this land to possess. So God reminds Abram of who he is and where Abram's come from. He's a random nobody from Ur of the Chaldeans. And God reintroduces himself here to Abram, and actually, this is the first time that God has told Abram his name. Remember back to the very beginning of Genesis, God reveals himself most often in two different ways. He calls himself the Lord, which is a sort of title, or God, Elohim. It just means the high, the most high God. But he has a personal covenantal name, not unlike how you and I have names, which is Yahweh. Well, this is the first time. God's been dealing with Abram for decades now. This is the first time that God tells Abram his personal name and reveals himself to Abram as Yahweh, his personal covenant name. And again, God is entering into relationship with Abram, that is friendship with Abram, which is the same as he desires for you and for me. But Abram says, verse 80, replies to God, O Lord God, how am I to know that I shall possess this land? Abram wants more confirmation, just like with the child, with the air and the stars. He believes, verse 6 says, he believes, and it was counted to him as righteousness, but he wants more. He's asking God, give me more. Can you show me some more stars or something else about this land? And God responds here by cutting a covenant and enacting a sacred covenant ceremony. Now, if you've not been with us in Genesis, covenants are a very important word in the story of Genesis and idea in the story of the Bible. Indeed, covenants, in a way, are what stitch the whole Bible together and the only way for you or me or anybody to relate with God. They're promises, but they're more than that. They're big binding promises by which God binds himself to a people and relates to a people. And here we have the sacred covenant ceremony of the covenant that God made with Abram. So let's look together at what one Jewish writer called the haunting mystery of the covenantal moment here in Genesis 15. And I want to show you this covenant. We're going to look at it in three different parts. If you're a note taker, I'm going to divide this into three different sections divided by three different strange, sometimes bizarre elements in this covenant. First the blood, we'll look at verses 9 and 10. Second, the birds of prey, we'll look at verses 11 through 16. And finally, the smoke and the fire, we'll look at the rest of the passage, verses 18 through 21. So the blood, the birds of prey, the smoke and the fire. Let's look first at the blood involved in this covenant. Look back with me at verse 9. God said to Abram, bring me a heifer, that's a cow, three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtle dove, and a young pigeon. And so Abram brought him all these, went and gathered them, brought him all these, cut them in half, and laid each half over against the other. But he did not cut the birds in half. So God initiates this covenant ceremony here, this ancient covenant ceremony, which is very foreign, very strange, very bizarre to us, but which would have been very familiar to Abram and to the people of Abram's day. This was how ancient peoples often entered into contract with each other. You can see here in the passage that once God asked, Abram seems to know exactly what to do with the animals. And so a calf, a goat, a ram, and two birds, the larger animals, Abram takes and he cuts in half along the spine, and he takes those divided animals and he lays them across from each other in two separate, sort of mirroring each other's lines, forming a path in between these slain animals. Now this passage, as is often the case in the Bible, is very modest. But I need you to understand that this is a very bloody affair. Abram's hands would have been surely dyed dark red from these preparations. The path in between the divided animals would have been a very bloody path. When we were kids, I don't know about you, but when I was a kid and we were telling tall tales to our friends, we would often swear. And how did we do that? We would say things like, I swear on my life, or I swear on my grave, or the really bold or foolish ones among us would swear on, or cowardly ones among us would swear on our mother's grave. And I was way too superstitious to do that sort of thing, but I had a friend named Fletcher who was not afraid to swear on his mother's grave. Now kids shouldn't talk like that, neither should adults for the record. But what were we saying when we swear in those ways? We're saying, God on my life, take my life if I'm not telling the truth right now. Kids don't realize they're saying that, but that's what you're saying when you say those sorts of words. That's why we shouldn't speak like that. May God, we're saying, may God even desecrate my own mother's grave, how twisted is that, if I'm lying in this moment? Those are foolish, flippant words of kids, and the technical word for what we foolish kids were doing there in those moments is taking a self-maledictory oath. In other words, an oath of self-harm, or maybe in simplest terms, a curse, calling a curse upon ourselves. That's the nature of this oath we're beholding in this ceremony we're beholding in Genesis 15 between God and Abram. A bloody pool is formed between these slain animals, which was called the blood path. The two parties entering into this covenant with each other were to take turns walking that bloody path, both ritually saying, so shall it be to me, bloodied and divided in two as these slain animals, if I break my promise. Later in the Bible, when Israel fails to keep another such oath, having promised here to set slaves free and then going back on her word, you can see exactly how this works in God's response to Israel's disobedience. You don't have to turn there, but let me read for you from Jeremiah 34, where God speaks and references a very similar sort of oath taken and betrayed by Israel. Listen to God's chilling words here. Jeremiah 34, 18, and the men who transgressed my covenant and did not keep the terms of the covenant that they made before me, I will make them like the calf that they cut in two and pass between its parts. Do you see? That's what you're promising. That's what you're calling upon yourself. If you betray this, that calf cut in two, God, bring it upon me. This is an oath of curse. Now you might be wondering, Abram just wanted assurance. Just God, what about the land? God's making a promise here. Why couldn't he just say, Abram, I promise, or found some more stars or more sand or grain or something and just made another promise to Abram? Why all this bizarre links of God just to answer Abram's request for more assurance? That's a good question, an important question. The answer is even more important, and the answer is this. Sin requires death. Sin requires death. This is a law more basic to God's universe than gravity. God engaging with man after sin, after Adam, Eve, and the garden, after you and I and everybody joins in rebellion against God, God engaging with man involves bloodshed and the death of a victim. God here is now entering into a binding relationship with Abram, one random sinful man from Ur of the Chaldeans, a southern Iraq. God has now placed his blessing upon him, and through him God is working to restore the world and restore God's blessing which was lost in the garden to all peoples, even you and I if we trust in these promises. Here God is making these binding promises to Abram and to his descendants, and these promises involve bloodshed and sacrifice and death. Whenever the Bible talks about God making a covenant or sealing a covenant, the word that they use to make a covenant actually translates to cut. You don't actually technically make a covenant or seal a covenant, though that's true. That captures the idea. What you actually do, what we read again and again and again, is you cut a covenant. In verse 18 in our passage, it says on that day the Lord made a covenant. The word there made is karat. It's from which we get the word karat, like if you're wearing a diamond right now. It's a two karat. That refers to how it was cut. Or if you cut a deal with somebody, that's referring to this idea. God cuts a covenant. Here in this passage you can get an idea of why that language is used. This is a bloody affair here. Have you grappled with the seriousness of your sins? How heavy of a thing it is for us to ever be forgiven, for us to ever have an audience with God, for God to enter into any kind of relationship with us other than as judge. Sin requires death, blood. Which brings us, as we continue moving along this strange scene, to the birds of prey. In verses 11 through 16. Look at verse 11 again. And when birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away. Again, this is such a bizarre, weird scene. I don't know what you thought about it while Frank was reading it, or maybe you read it this week preparing for this Sunday, but what an absolutely bizarre scene. So Abram does what God asks, so there's fresh blood and slain animals everywhere. And what do you know? It evidently catches the attention, or the nostrils, of birds of prey. Who are these birds? Remember, this is a vision Abram's receiving. Who are these birds? Well the passage doesn't say, and God doesn't tell, Abram who these birds are. And there's definitely mystery to this scene, and I don't want to just dissolve all the mystery by giving you really clean and clear, black and white, neat answers. And yet, there's something going on here with these vultures. And I'm confident of that because this strange scene sort of reverberates again and again, strangely still, throughout the rest of the Bible. Let me give you just a quick sampling. Deuteronomy 28, 26. And your dead body, the word of the Lord says, shall be food for all the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth, and there shall be no one to frighten them away. Jeremiah 7, verse 33. And the dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the air and for the beasts of the earth, and none will frighten them away. Matthew 24, 28. Jesus now, at the end of his life, excuse me, talking about the last days when the judgment will come, says this, for as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. And then he says this weird cryptic saying, wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather. There's a lot going on there. I don't have all the answers, but I just want you to see that throughout the Bible, in scenes of judgment, who shows up? These vultures always show up. And in the darkest scenes of judgment, where a prophet is saying to God's people who have betrayed God, hey, you have no hope here, what do the prophets say? They say, hey, the vultures will come upon your dead bodies, and no one will be there to frighten away. In other words, he says, the prophets warn, there'll be no Abram to save you this time. Are these Abrams soon to be enemies in the promised land, the vultures? Are these Israels future oppressors, Egypt or Babylon and all the rest? Are these demons, or the devil himself? Are these all the enemies of God's people? The text raises these questions, but doesn't exactly answer them. And it's at this point we read in verse 12, look at your Bible, that the sun goes down and a deep sleep falls upon Abram. This is the same language, and it's the first time this language has been used, and we've seen it since Genesis 2.21, when the Lord God, we read, caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, so that he, the Lord God, then took from one of his ribs and fashioned the woman from his side, who he called Eve. That's the same language. God is here, caused a deep sleep to fall upon Abram, and behold, verse 12 says, a dreadful and great darkness fell upon Abram as the presence of God draweth near. Have you ever wondered how will you know if God is actually, how will you know if this is a real revival? Rolling on the floor and laughing, and we've all got tickle gas, tickle gas, laughing gas, and just how will we know if God is near us? I think the surest way we'll know is the sense of holy awe before God. That's how people consistently in the Bible, when they encounter the real God, that's how they consistently respond, holy terror, awe before God Almighty. Then the Lord said to Abram, verse 13, know for certain that your offspring will be sojourners in a land that is not theirs, and will be servants there, and they will be afflicted for 400 years, but I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve, and afterwards they shall come out with great possessions. As for you, Abram, you shall go down to your fathers in peace. You shall be buried in a good old age, and they, your people, your descendants, shall come back here into the promised land in the fourth generation, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete. Abram wants clarity. He wants assurance. He wants a sign, more stars, God, more detail. What about this land, God? So God takes the promise of land, and he clarifies it. Up to this point, he's only given Abram a 3,000-foot view. Back in chapter 12, he told Abram, calling him out of Ur of the Chaldeans, go unto the land that I have promised you. That's all he's given him, this super foggy, fuzzy, 30,000-foot view of some land, somewhere is going to be Abram's land. Well, here, what does he do? He takes that lens of that camera, and he focuses it into the future, and shows Abram much more detail. Look at the detailed picture that God gives here to Abram. Verse 13, your offspring will be sojourners and servants in a land not theirs. Verse 13, they will be afflicted there, your descendants, Abram. In a foreign land by a foreign people, they'll be afflicted there for 400 years. That's a round number. The Bible often uses round numbers. You can see here, just later in this passage, it gives you a more specific number of exactly 430 years. But it's a round number here of 400 years, your people will be afflicted. Verse 14, then God sharpens the lens further, then God will step in and judge your oppressors and set your people free, and not just set your people free, but set them free with some of their oppressors' possessions. They'll be richer and take from plunder from their enemies, oppressive enemies. And verse 16, and then after the iniquity of the Amorites is complete, then finally the land is theirs. Oh, and you, Abram, verse 15, you won't be here to see it. You'll be dead, peacefully dead, but dead. Now pause right there, because before we go any further, I want to talk for you a minute about the iniquity of the Amorites. I wonder if you saw that phrase and just puzzled over what in the world is happening with the iniquity of the Amorites. Amorites here just refers to all these people that are presently occupying the Promised Land. So if you look at verses 19 and 20 and 21, the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, all those people here, God refers to them collectively as a whole. One, he just refers to them as a sort of catch-all as the Amorites. So all the inhabitants of the Promised Land are the Amorites. So God is saying, watch this, God is saying, this land, which is now their land, you're still in their land, Abram, they're still here. This land, which is their land now, is yours after the iniquity of the Amorites is complete or full. In other words, God is saying here, promising to Abram, once they, all those other people, all those other enemies, tribes, once they've filled their cup all the way to the brim and are overflowing with sin, then, and only then, and not a second before then, then God will judge them and give you the land. I'm pointing this out because I want you to see this is a picture of God's perfect justice. Some of you, I'm sure, struggle with the ongoing story of the Bible as you continue through the Old Testament as Joshua and others lead Israel at God's command to slaughter these enemies and just completely wipe them out and purge them from the Promised Land. How could God do that? But I want you to see this because you need to see God's justice here, which is never haphazard and never heavy-handed. It's always proportional and exact. Joshua's armies are not unleashed until the people have so defied God in this land and so filled their cup with sin that the death penalty is the only option. Do you see God's justice here? Which by the way is a sobering thought to think about ourselves in our own times and even in our own country. We live in a country that slaughters babies in the womb by the millions. We live in a country that has taken God's most basic design and gender of God's most treasured possessions and His image bearers and we've denied its reality and made ourselves in doing so out to be morally superior to God. I don't know what's blasphemous if that's not blasphemy. We all pretend to care about the poor and the needy and even use them as props to fight our opponents as we ourselves comfortably avoid them and fill our bellies and our closets with more and more and more. God have mercy on us, on our country as we fill our own cup to the brim. Listen, I believe that the only, I preach this all the time, we only preach this, the only hope for our nation and for any nation is the gospel. It's not water, it's not bread, it's not politics, it's not the government. The only hope for any people for eternal salvation is the gospel and it's my job and our job to remind you of that and stop being distracted by all this other stuff. Every single week, politics will not save people's souls, but also I want to remind you this morning that our prayers for our nation and for our government, which are commanded by God by the way, are not in vain and also that those of you working in politics and working in public policy do not work in vain and also that all of you and all of us, whatever our lot in life, all of us ought to fight for justice and stand for righteousness in a culture that laughs and celebrates and worships itself as it fills its own cup for destruction. God help us. The land is Abram's, God promises, but not for 400 more years because only then would it be just for God to give them this land. To hold the mercy and justice of God. And by the way, in case you were wondering, this is indeed exactly what happened as the story unfolds. Just briefly, by the end of Genesis, Abram's people, Israel, where are they? By the end of Genesis and the beginning of Exodus. Kids, where were God's people, Abram's descendants? At the end of Genesis, the beginning of Exodus, do you remember? Adults, you don't remember either. Where were they? They were in Egypt, right? In Egypt, they took refuge from another famine. In Egypt, after Joseph dies, what happens then? They're enslaved and afflicted and in their affliction, they cry out to God for deliverance. Exodus 1.11, therefore, we read the Egyptians set taskmasters over God's people. Why? To afflict them. It's the same word, exact same word as used here in verse 11 in our passage. To afflict them with heavy burdens. Then, God, just as he promised, raised up Moses, plagued the Egyptians, parted the seas, and set his people free. That's the Exodus, right? Just as he promised. And how long did all of this take? Any idea? Exodus 12, 40 through 41, the time that the people of Israel lived in Egypt, were afflicted in Egypt, was 430 years. At the end of 430 years, on that very day, all the host of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt. Every word, exactly as God promised. In Abram, Genesis 25, verse 7, these are the days, long before that, long before affliction in Egypt, these are the days of the years of Abram's life, Abraham's life, 175 years. And Abraham breathed his last and died in a good old age, an old man and full of years and was gathered to his people. All of you here this morning are alive. Did you know? Praise God. Bless God you're alive this morning. Are you happy to be alive this morning? Yes. Amen. Me too. All of you, also this morning, have another day, another time, days, months, years, decades from now, which God has appointed, but which you know not, at which time God will call you home to be with himself. And between now and then, and whenever that is, or between here and there, if you like, there will be surely, hopefully, lots of triumphs, but also lots of trials and lots of sufferings and in the end, surely death, such is life, yes? And if I somehow was told by God, in a vision, I haven't been, I want to be clear, but if I was somehow told by God, in a vision, exactly what those years and that gap to the day, to the year, and what your trials and what those struggles would be, if I knew exactly what your future was going to be, and I offered to tell it to you, would you want to know? Would you want to know all the sufferings, which you probably couldn't bear if you knew them all at once before they happened? Abram now knows everything, because he asked God, and God told it to him. And every word of God came true, because they always do. Which brings us finally to the smoke and the fire, in verses 17 through 21, the smoke and the fire. Look at verse 17, when the sun had gone down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces. I want to read for you a quote, a remarkable quote, which I found this week. I'll tell you who wrote it after I read it to you. Quote, I often tell people that if I were marooned on an island and had only one book, the book that I would want with me, of course, would be the Bible. But if I could only have one book of the Bible, I would want to have the book of Hebrews, because of the way it so richly summarizes all the teachings of the Old Testament and relates them to the finished work of Jesus in the New Testament. But if I could only have one verse of the Bible, I would want Genesis 15, verse 17. R.C. Sproul said that. What in the world is he seeing about Genesis? If you remember, R.C. Sproul was kind of a clever guy, jokester. What is he seeing about Genesis 15, 17? And don't you want to see whatever it is that he's seeing about this verse that made him say, if I could just have one verse with me for the rest of my life, give me Genesis 15, 17, and the smoking fire pot and flaming torch passing between these pieces. The sun has now set. It's now darker than dark between the absence of light and the holy presence of God. And now Abram, remember, this is all a vision. And now Abram sees strange things in the vision. Strange but wondrous things. In the aisles of carcasses, Abram watches two objects mysteriously, chillingly walk the bloody path. A smoking furnace, basically a portable oven enshrouded by a cloud of smoke and a flaming torch. Smoke and fire, he sees. Heat and light. Either floating, I don't know, or sliding, I have no idea. But Abram sees them, these two objects, moving between these dead animals and walking this bloody path. Now this is everything, and I want to make three observations about this dramatic climax to this vision of Abram. And this is where I want to land this sermon, and I want it to land in your hearts and your heads and your minds this morning. Number one, three observations. Number one, first, this, these objects, this is God. We've already been tipped off that Abram is in the presence of God himself. He's overcome by dreadful great darkness. He's hearing, hear the voice of God. These objects, smoking oven and a flaming torch, are strange, but the more you read the Bible, the plainer the strange becomes. Exodus 13, 21, listen to the word of the Lord. And the Lord went before them, the people of Israel, by day in a pillar of cloud or smoke to lead them along the way, and by night a pillar of fire to give them light that they might travel by day and night. Exodus 19, 18, listen to the word of the Lord. Now Mount Sinai, God coming to cut another covenant with his people Israel, with Moses, and he comes to his people at Mount Sinai, what do they see, what does it look like? Now Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke because the Lord had descended on it in fire. The smoke of it went up like the smoke of a kiln and the whole mountain trembled greatly. One more time, Exodus 20, verse 18, listen to the word of the Lord. Now when all the peoples saw the thunder and the flashes of lightning and the sound of the trumpet and the mountains smoking, the people were afraid, Israel, afraid and trembled and they stood far off and they said to Moses, you speak to us and we'll listen, but don't let God, that smoking fiery furnace, don't let him speak to us lest we die. Now God is spirit, he has no body or no physical component to him, that's part of why we can say he's omnipresent, he's everywhere, God is spirit, so he can't be seen, no one has ever seen God, John 1 says, but almost every time he chooses to draw near and reveal himself to Abram, to Isaac, to Moses or to any of his people, almost every time he reveals himself in the form of smoke or a fire. Even when we come to the New Testament, after we've seen and walked with the Lord Jesus God incarnate himself, Hebrews 12, 28 through 29, therefore let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken and let us offer to God acceptable worship with reverence and awe, there's that word again, why? For our God is a consuming fire, Revelation 15 verse 8, and the sanctuary in the throne room was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power and no one could enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished. In this haunting darkness of a vision, God has come to Abram, this is God, second, God walks the bloody path, God walks the bloody path, the smoking furnace and the flaming torch, verse 17 says, they pass between the pieces. Now the last time we saw God walking upon the earth, it was where? In the first chapters of Genesis, before sin and death entered the world, God walked in the garden in the cool of the day, Genesis 3, 8 says. He was there among them, walking in the cool of the garden before he was gone in judgment on account of our sin. God is back here in Abram's vision, God is back, but he's not rustling the plush, have to be surely fall colored leaves of Eden's paradise. That world was lost and gone forever. Here God is back walking and he walks in the darkness, surrounded by slain animal carcasses, a graveyard along a bloodstained path, a path of curse under the threat of death, surrounded by suffering. God is walking here with Abram to establish his covenant with him and with his offspring forever. God walks the bloody path. God walks this path alone. God walks this bloody path and he does it alone. This is the most remarkable part of this bizarre, remarkable scene, and I don't want you to miss it. If you've missed everything else this morning, this is the part you can't miss. This is a two-party covenant. That means there's two parties involved. You don't do this alone. You can't do this alone. You're in a covenant. You're binding yourself to another person, even as they themselves are binding themselves to you. There's no such thing as a one-party covenant. By definition, covenants involve two parties. Many years ago, as a younger man, I entered into a one-way confidentiality agreement, as in, I can't speak about what's happening here, but the other party could speak about what was happening here. Now, I went, not really knowing what I was doing here. I went and told other older men, and they looked at me and scratched their heads like, that's not a thing. That's not real. Don't ever do that again. Yes, sir. You don't have a one-way confidentiality agreement. There's no such thing as a one-way covenant. Covenants, by definition, are two-party agreements, binding agreements between two parties. This covenant has two parties, God and Abram and all of Abram's descendants. This chilling ceremony between the dead carcasses and the bloody path is for two parties. You're to take turns walking through the blood, soaking your feet in the blood, each taking on the death curse. But Abram is asleep or awake. I honestly have no idea. This is so weird. But regardless, his feet never touch that blood path. This is a death oath, a curse. This is, may I be slaughtered in two and cut in two as these animals, should I break this vow, and God enters into that promise under the threat of that curse, and he does it alone on behalf of Abram and on behalf of all Abram's people. Meaning, not only should God fail to keep his end of the bargain unthinkable, but then in such a bizarre case, he would take on the curse. But even more meaning, should Abram or should any of Abram's descendants fail to keep their end of the bargain, very real possibility, even still, God, in that instance, would take the curse upon himself. Two parties walk the path. Whoever breaks his promise, whichever party breaks the promise, will die. When one party walks the path, whoever breaks, whichever party breaks, he, the one who walks alone, shall bear the curse. I'm excited by the couple of amens because it tells me that some of us in the room are seeing what, I don't know, maybe R.C. Sproul saw or maybe God's word wants us to see. Abram, how can I know, God? That's all he asked for. God, how can I know that this land will be mine? What land and how will I know it can be mine? God's answer, a bloody, dramatic covenant. And what about you? How can you know? How can you know anything about your salvation and your security? Do you ever wonder if you've committed the wrong sin? Pushed it with one sin in particular for too long and for too far and you're beyond the brink of forgiveness. Many of us don't take our sin nearly seriously enough. Sin, again, brings wrath and blood and death. I've been a Christian and I've understood and been floored by the logic of the gospel for quite a long time now. But sometimes, I would even confess to you, I have moments where I fear, oh Lord, help me not to be self-deceived. Oh God, am I self-deceived? How can I, how can my heart still have so much darkness in it after all these years of following Jesus? How can I still care so little for the poor and for the needy? What about you? And it's in those moments that what I need and what you need are dramatic images like this one of smoking ovens and flaming torches, of burning coals to lips, of righteous robes and of crosses and of empty graves. Where Abraham and Isaiah and David and thieves upon crosses and you and me have no role whatsoever but to sleep and watch and contribute nothing. And just believe that God really is this good and salvation really is this one-sided. And God really does uphold his end of the bargain always and ours too. How can you know? How can you know? How can Abram know a bloody dramatic covenant? How can you know God's answer? Another bloody dramatic covenant which ultimately fulfilled this covenant we're reading about this morning. Beneath another thick cloud of darkness, as the lights went out once more, the gospel writers say for three hours across all the land, where another victim entered into another cursed path, where the blood of another innocent was shed as his body was slain upon slabs of wood, and where he, the victim, took God's awful curse of death and he took it all upon himself and where he did it all alone. Try to get up there on that cross and help him out with your sins. It will not work and it will compromise everything. Do you see why this old strange covenant matters for you? Let me give you a quote about Genesis 15 in this weird smoking furnace and flaming fire. If this covenant is broken, quote, if this covenant is broken, Abraham, for whatever reason, this is God speaking, if this covenant is broken, Abraham, God is saying for whatever reason, for my unfaithfulness or yours, I will pay the price, says God. If you or your descendants for whom you are making this covenant fail to keep it, I will pay the price in blood, says God. And at that moment, almighty God in Genesis 15 pronounced the death sentence on his son, Jesus. End quote. The presence of God, smoking furnace, flaming torch, covers the bloody path on our behalf. The covenant here has been cut and sealed for Abraham and for all his people. The son of God, the Lord Jesus, bloodshed and body slain took the cross on our behalf. The covenant has been cut and sealed for Abraham and for all who believe. Only belief. God, we thank you for your word this morning. And we pray that you would take these promises sealed of old in blood and sealed finally in the blood of Jesus Christ and seal them upon our hearts. God, we believe, help our unbelief as we sin, as we suffer, as we fear, as we doubt, as we struggle through life. Help our unbelief. Anchor us in Jesus, we pray. And give us security and assurance just as you gave to Abraham. God, for those who have not yet trusted in the Lord Jesus and found forgiveness for their sins, God, awaken faith. We, your people, cry out to you now on their behalf. Would you awaken faith in them even this moment? And we pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
