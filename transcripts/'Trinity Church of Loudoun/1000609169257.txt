Yesterday, two of our kids had soccer games, slightly different times, but close enough together in different locations. And so we had to split up, and my wife went to one kid's game, and I stayed at the other kid's games, and we drew straws, and I lost, and so I kept the baby with me, and so things were fine. We survived the game. I caught little bits and pieces. And then it was time to go, and so I grabbed two of our folding chairs in one arm, and water bottles, and a blanket, and keys, and everything else, and I asked one of my older kids to do her best to walk the baby to the car, which was across like three other empty soccer fields. Now the baby is one and a half, so she's at peak confidence, just sort of clomping around, barely stable like a miniature Frankenstein of sorts. And so my oldest daughter walks her towards the field, and things start out well enough. They're holding hands, and they're headed in the right direction. It's really just a beautiful picture. I wish I would have had free hands to take a photo of this moment and capture what God was doing, really, hashtag sisters. But I didn't, and that was just for a moment before right in front of me, I'm sort of creeping behind. I know what's likely to happen here. The hand-holding ends, and the baby decides she wants to go another direction towards the woods. And so the car's this way, I'm here, and she takes off towards the woods. And so sister sort of tracks her down and redirects her, and that leads to a strong reaction of dislike and frustration. And so she sort of goes off in another wrong direction, still just even worse direction. And then sister picks her up, and she really, really doesn't like that. And so now she's kicking and screaming and squirming, and I knew this was gonna have to happen. And so I catch up, and I pick her up myself and give to the older sister some other stuff to carry. She hates that too, and she's kicking and screaming with me. But I'm scurrying away, and we make it to our minivan, and I put her in the seat and try to put on the seatbelt, and I've now found the thing that most ticks her off, and she's kicking and screaming about that. But I got her in, and then we made it home, and she took a nap, praise God. Please turn with me to Genesis 19, if you have a Bible. Please turn with me to Genesis 19. We pick up our series in Genesis. I will give just a really brief, I guess a warning to parents of explicit content to follow, not from me, actually from the Bible. And so if you have young kids in the room, if at any point, I've worked very hard, and I'm certainly gonna do my best to use wise, judicious language. I've worked very hard to avoid even words that might lead to conversations that you're not ready to have with your kids yet, but it is an unbelievably sordid passage from beginning to end. And so if at any point, I have a six-year-old in here, I'm fine with that. She doesn't listen to me anyways. But if at any point you feel like you need to walk outside or go get more coloring or whatever, please feel free to do so without any fear of judgment or shame from us. Just for a little bit of reminder, refresher, a couple of weeks ago, we left off in Genesis 18. The Lord came down and visited Abraham, who's now his covenant partner and friend. And with two angels, the Lord came and shared a meal with Abraham because they're friends now. And after the meal, the Lord revealed to Abraham what he was about to do to Sodom, how he was about to destroy it for its evil. Well, Abraham's nephew, Lot, lives in Sodom. And so Abraham intervened and interceded and really pleaded with God, really testing God's mercy. The big question he asked God is this, will not the judge of the earth do what is right? And he kept working the Lord and testing the Lord until he got the Lord all the way down to saying, yes, Abraham, even if there are just 10 righteous people in the city, I will spare the city for the sake of the 10 righteous. And so Abraham did prove the Lord's heart. He will do even more than what's right, he'll be merciful. And so we pick up this morning in Sodom and with those two angels who were with Abraham and the Lord, those two angels arriving in Sodom. And there are four sort of scenes or acts in this chapter this morning. You can find them in the little insert in your bulletin if you'd like to take notes. I put that down for you in case that's helpful to you. But here's the main thing I want you to see from all four acts and really from this entire chapter of the Bible. The judgment of the wicked is certain and so is the salvation of the righteous. That's I think the main thing that God is wanting to teach us from all of these shocking events this morning. And that's what I want you to take away from our time together in God's Word. The judgment of the wicked is certain and so is the salvation of the righteous. And so let's test that. Let's tease that out from these four scenes or acts beginning with Act 1, the wicked city. And we'll look here at verses 1 through 11. So let's get into this story. If you have your Bible, Genesis 19, verse 1 says the two angels arrived to Sodom in the evening. And Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. So it's now evening time. They were with Abraham in the mid warmth of the day. And the angels arrived to the city. They've come to investigate as cries of injustice have reached heaven and reached God's ears from all the wicked happening in Sodom, in Gomorrah. And so arriving to the city of Sodom, the angels are met by Lot, who we read is sitting in the gate of the city. Now, I want to point out something that's subtly been happening in the story of Genesis. If you were paying attention to the details with respect to Lot and Sodom. If you have your Bible and you just want to flip back and hold your place. In Genesis chapter 13 and verse 12, we read that, remember, Lot and Abraham, their uncle and nephew. And they both got so many possessions that they overcrowded each other, which was leading to conflict. And so Abraham said, go wherever you want. And Lot chose Sodom. And we read in chapter 13, verse 12, that Abram settled in the land of Canaan. While Lot settled, Lot had first pick. He settled among the cities of the valley and moved his tent as far as Sodom. So Abraham's up on this high hill where the oaks of Mamre reside. He dwells in tents beneath those trees up on a high hill. Lot's down in the valley and in the cities of the valley. And in 13, verse 12, he's ventured out as far as and near Sodom. Flip over to chapter 14, also verse 12. We read that, remember, these are those invading armies that Abraham eventually rescued Lot and the others from. We read that those invading armies took Lot, the son of Abram's brother, who was dwelling in Sodom and his possessions and went their way. So Lot has now moved from chapter 13 where he's near Sodom. He's pitching a tent near Sodom to now he's dwelling in Sodom. So he's moved into the city by the time he's captured by these invading armies. And now, finally, you can go back to chapter 19 where we're camping out. In 19, verse 1, we read that Lot is sitting in the gate of Sodom. Now, this is significant because city gates in the Bible, they appear a lot, actually, in the Old Testament. And they are seats of power and influence. There at the city gate, leaders of a city did business. They discussed the affairs of the city. They made important decisions. Court deliberations were made in the city gate. So Lot, I want you to see, he's moved from outside of the city of Sodom to living in the city of Sodom to now even having a position of power and influence in the city. Lot, we're going to see as this story moves on, is now entangled, really entangled in the city of sin. Sodom, let this be a lesson for us all. We all think we can tiptoe around sin, which is exactly what Satan wants us to think, that we can be near and we can be close, that we can look but not touch or taste. I want you to watch Lot as we walk through this story, a man who surely reasoned to himself that he could be in this wicked city and enjoy all the pleasurable things of this wicked city without participating in the evil of the city. I want you to watch how the city has deceived him. And so the two angels arrive in the city and Lot immediately goes out of his way to welcome them and care for them. In this way, he does remind us of Uncle Abraham, who just the chapter before practiced hospitality with these same angels and with the Lord. Ancient hospitality was much more than a nice dinner. It was food. It was shelter. It was even protection from harm, which is exactly what Lot fights for upon meeting these angels. Notice the first little disagreement in our passage is over where the angels will stay. They want to stay in the town square because they have a job to do. They're here to investigate. Lot insists that they stay in his house. Why? Because Lot knows what will happen to them if they stay out in the open. Lot knows his city and Lot knows the people of his city and what they're about to do, what we're about to watch them attempt to do. They've done before. Lot's seen it before. And so Lot wins them over, persuades them to stay with him. He cooks them up a feast. Man, these angels have eaten good on this day between Abraham and now Lot. He cooks them a feast. He prepares them for a night's rest. And then at bedtime, Lot hears a knock on the door and then a commotion outside. Not good. Lot knows exactly what this means. In verse four, we read, But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people to the last man. I want you to think about that little phrase, that little detail. Moses included all the people to the last man. Remember, Abraham pleading for a city. What if there are ten righteous? Yeah, I'll spare it for ten righteous. All the people, everyone to the last man, surrounded the house. And verse five says, They called to Lot, Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us that we may know them. Or your Bible may read, we may lie with them. The men of the city took note earlier of the strangers entering their town. Remember, angels here are appearing in the form of men, presumably appearing as men in the prime of life. And the men of the town want to have them. They want to assault them. And so Lot intervenes. Verse six says, Lot went out to the men at the entrance and shut the door after him. And he said, So he puts himself in harm's way. He goes outside to this wild bunch of men. And he says to them, I beg you, my brothers, do not act so wickedly. Behold, I have two daughters who have not yet known any man. Let me bring them to you and you do to them as you please. Only do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shelter of my roof. I want to address a couple of things here before we go any further. I want to address a couple of things. First, I want to address Lot and the twisted offer he just made. Because I know you're all reading this like, wait, what? And I hardly know what to say here other than if I could risk self-righteous. How could he? His own daughters? He does try to protect against one evil. But he tries to protect against one horrible evil with another, in some ways, still worse evil. What father would offer up his own daughters to the ravenous, lust, thirsty mob of this town? And just to be clear, in case you're wondering, the Bible is not presenting Lot favorably here. This entire story, this entire chapter this morning presents Lot as an ambiguous, compromised character. And the story ends, as we'll see at the end, with an awful, ironic twist. Clearly showing that Lot's sin here came back to haunt him. Secondly, I want to address the wicked men of this wicked city. We knew it was bad. Their cry went up to God, after all. But what exactly was their sin? What was so bad? I want to observe three things for you from this passage here and really from the rest of the Bible. Which helps us here to understand what their sin was and why it was so bad. First of all, we saw a few weeks ago, but in case you forgot, that their sin was broad and it included pride and greed. So they're not just indicted before God for one particularly heinous sin. Ezekiel 16, 49 and 50, the prophet looks back and says, behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom. She and her daughters had pride. Excess of food and prosperous ease, but did not aid the poor and the needy. They were haughty and did an abomination before me. So I removed them when I saw it. They were, first thing I want you to see, they were haughty. They were arrogant. They were self-absorbed. They had no regard for God. And so they had no regard for the poor and the destitute among them or around them. Second, the New Testament actually helps us out here and specifically Jesus' brother, Jude. So you don't have to turn here, but you can turn to the very back of your Bible, if you like. Almost to the very end, that last little book before Revelation. It's a really short book, so you can skip over it. But Jude 6 and 7, listen to what Jesus' brother says about Sodom and Sodom's sin. This is so fascinating. Jude 6 and 7. Now, this is complicated and surely weird, but Jude makes a comparison here between two notorious events in Genesis. The first event is Genesis 6, where I don't have time to get into this. I got into it like a year ago. You can go back and listen to the wild, fun sermon on that, if you like. But in Genesis 6, fallen angels lusted after and then went after human women. And that great sin, which was representative of everything else that was happening in the world, awful, everybody rebelled against God. That was the precursor to the flood. The second event Jude reflects on is our passage this morning, Genesis 19, where fallen men now lusted and went after angels. Which is a precursor to the fire and brimstone and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Now, I know that's strange, but do you see how those two events, Genesis 6 and Genesis 19, are related? They're actually mirror images. They're opposite, reflecting images of each other. In the first one, fallen angels go after human women, sinfully. In the second one, fallen men go after celestial beings, angels, righteous angels. And so they're inverse pictures of one another. But what do they share in common? Unnatural desire and a God-ordained boundary is being transgressed. There's no regard in both instance for God or any authority of God. It's a forbidden union. But third, I haven't yet mentioned what Sodom is most famously associated with, and that is homosexuality. Now, as far as the townsmen are concerned, these are two men. Where are the men, they cry in verse 5. When Lot tries to step in between his guest and the townsmen, they warn Lot. Look at verse 9. Now, you've become our judge now. Now we will deal worsely with you than them. I'm not sure if this is clear in the English or if you read this in this way, but what they're saying is we're going to sexually assault you even worse than we were going to assault the angels. The sin of Sodom might have been more than homosexuality, and it certainly was. There's assault, there's pride, there's oppression. But it certainly was not less than homosexuality. And so I want to take just a few moments and I want to give you a brief word on homosexuality. And I want to take the time to do this really because of the times we're living in. I want to speak to our teenagers and our young adults as you are bombarded every day, really with a story from our world. It's a story, it's a narrative, and it's a lie. And I want to speak to all the church as all the church at large risks in our day losing clarity on something which is not at all unclear in the Bible. A recent documentary came out, won all kinds of awards, basically launching what I don't know what to call it other than a conspiracy theory that the church in the year 1946 changed translations of the Bible, which before did not say homosexuality. Now they say homosexuality. So now, because the church had an agenda, it's condemning homosexuality, which had never been condemned before. I don't want to laugh, but that's the most preposterous, absurd thing that one could possibly put forward. Let me just briefly overview the Bible and both Testaments and give you just a sampling of what the Bible says about homosexuality. This, Genesis 19, is the first episode of homosexual desire or behavior in the Bible. The name of this city is notorious in the English language with the awful sin associated with homosexuality. Homosexuality was later in the same book, the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible, was forbidden by the law twice. Twice, the Lord spoke to Moses and said, a man shall not lie with a man as with a woman. I don't know how that's ambiguous. A man shall not lie with a man as with a woman, for it is. And both times, God says this word, it is an abomination. You can see Leviticus 18, 22. I'm going to give you these references in case some of you want to look into this. In Leviticus 20, verse 13. Flipping over to the New Testament, Paul calls women exchanging relationships with men for other women and men exchanging relationships with women for men. Paul calls this behavior shameless, dishonorable passions, unnatural, and evidence of a debased mind. That's Romans 1, 26 through 28. Later, Paul lists, and I'm not trying to score points with a, this is unbelievably sobering. Paul lists men who practice homosexuality among those who will not inherit the kingdom of God. First Corinthians 6, 9 and 10. Still later, Paul says that those who practice homosexuality practice what is contrary to sound doctrine, which accords with the gospel. In other words, he equates those given over to homosexuality with denying the gospel, which alone can save. That's 1 Timothy 1, verse 10. So much more could be said. I just want to briefly show you the Bible is anything but unclear on this issue. But neither is our culture unclear on this issue today. And so the church must decide who she will bow to. You must decide who you will bow to, God's word or the culture. If I could call you, if you're here this morning and you claim to be a Christian, if I could call you to three things and three words with respect to this issue and how to respond to the Bible's teaching on this issue, it would be these three words. Number one, conviction. Conviction, know what the Bible teaches. Not knowing, feigning ignorance will not do in the days that we're living in. It's also not enough to, you know, some people are against homosexuality because, well, I'm for the way things used to be. That's not enough. That will not stand. I'm no more for the good old days than I am for, you know, the new and beautiful days we're living in. That doesn't matter. What matters is what God's word says. Figure out what God's word said and be convicted about it. Second word, courage. The church and every single one of us has to answer today. We didn't draw the battle line here. It's been different in every generation, but the culture has drawn the battle line here. Are you going to have, are we going to have the courage to stand with God's word no matter the cost? And third, compassion. Compassion, be like Jesus, love and befriend sinners and outcasts in such a way that's scandalous to the, to the quote, religious people of the day. Homosexual people, people who struggle with homosexuality are always welcome to come here, to hear God's word, to find friends in us, to hear about God's word. Where else would we, what else would we want to do with all people? We ourselves are sinners, aren't we? The men of the city encroach upon Lot. The scene here in the Bible is of one man trying to withstand an angry mob before they take over his guest, a man being pushed further and further back until he's now physically against his door, which they're about to break down. Can't you, can't you almost hear them trample him on their way? And right at that moment, the angels reach out and grab Lot and strike the mob with blindness. Verse 11 says, The word here for struck with blindness is the same word used in Acts 9, where Saul is traveling on the road to Damascus and he's met by the Lord who strikes him with a blinding light temporarily binding him. From everything around him. So we have a temporary blindness here with the townsmen, the angels. I don't know how that may be the light of pure holiness for a moment is unveiled to blind them. And the angels have now measured the city and learned all they need to know. Which leads us to Acts 2, where we have an escape in the night. And verses 12 through 22. Look at verse 12. Then the men said to Lot, Have you, so this is the angels. Have you anyone else here, sons in law, sons, daughters, anyone, anyone you have in the city, bring them out of the place. For we're about to destroy this place because the outcry against his people has become great before the Lord and the Lord has sent us to destroy it. And so Lot went out and said to his sons in law who were to marry his daughters up, get out of this place for the Lord is about to destroy the city. But he seemed to his sons in law to be joking, jesting. The angels now step into code red. It's emergency time. It's even though it's late into the night, it's now or never. You've got to go. We've got to go. They've seen clearly. They've seen all that they needed to see. They've proven what God already knew to be true. The city is entirely wicked without any exception. They are here. The angels are here for Lot's sake and for Lot's family. And really, it might be more accurate to say they're here for Abraham's sake. For God's friend who prayed for his family member, they're here for Abraham and for Abraham's nephew. And so they asked Lot, anybody else, you got any other family? It's go time right now. Lot runs outside for his sons in law, engaged to marry his daughters. He appeals to them. They think it's a joke. This is a laughing matter to them. Just like in Noah's day when Noah warned everybody that flood, that destruction was coming. What did they do? They laughed at him. They mocked him. One wonders, reading the text, if the sons in law were part of the sexually crazed mob trying to have the angels. The judgment of God always, always invites scoffers and laughter. I want to assure you this is not a joking matter. There's nothing more serious or more sure than the coming judgments of God. Time is up. Lot's sons in law are out. And so verse 15 says, as morning dawned, the angels urged Lot saying, up now, take your wife and your daughters who are here. Lest you be swept away in the punishment of the city. And then we read verse 16. Look at verse 16. But he lingered. How could he linger? He actually believes the angels. He knows that the city is about to be destroyed. And yet he lingers. Was he looking over his house and all the possessions he's accumulated and having a moment with them before he says goodbye to all of his wealth and all of his treasures? Was he looking out over the city, the city he loved, where he'd found power and wealth one last time? We don't know. But he lingered. I told you Lot had really gotten himself entangled into the city of Sodom. His heart was in Sodom. And it'd probably be even truer to say Sodom has now gotten into him. And so the men, verse 16 says, that is the angels, seized him. They grabbed him. They seized him and his wife and his two daughters by the hand, the Lord being merciful to him. And they brought him out and set him outside the city. And as they brought him out, one said, escape for your life. Do not look back or stop anywhere in the valley. Escape to the hills, lest you be swept away. And so they take off running together. The angels practically dragging Lot and his family to safety. And even while they're running, look at the passage. Even while they're running, Lot's negotiating. Look at verse 19 and 20. Not the hills, he says, I'll die. Lot's a man of the city. He always wanted the city. Not the hills. I'll die there. There's another city, a little city. And I think what you're supposed to read here is another little Sodom. Take me there. He genuinely cannot let Sodom go. The angels oblige. Verse 21 says, it says they showed him grace. And they give him what he asks for. And they called the city Zoar, which just means little. So they called the city little. It's little city and they called it little. So Zoar is another little city in the valley, just like Sodom or Gomorrah, a smaller version. But the angels agree to spare it. Why? For Lot's sake. Because that's exactly what God had promised. If any of my people are in any city, I'll spare the city. And so the Lord agrees to spare Zoar for Lot's sake. At this point, you've got to be wondering this morning, I hope you're wondering, why is Lot being spared? His daughters too, just wait for the end of this story. Why is Lot being spared? Lingering, foolishly negotiating, being an awful father and parent. Why Lot? Aren't some of you asking that question? Why Lot? Verse 16 tells us why he was spared. The Lord was being merciful to him. Why Lot? Why was Lot being spared? Because the Lord was being merciful to him. Listen to me. Some of us have this idea. Some of you who are Christians have this idea that the Lord called you, praise God. You didn't call yourself, but he called you. And then it was off to the races, you and the Lord, maybe him holding you by the hand, maybe him leading the way. But you're sort of together running right behind the Lord every once in a while, maybe even catching up to the Lord and meeting eyes and a little wink and smile. And I'm right with you, Lord, and just dodging Satan and the flesh and sin and me and the Lord running together to heaven. Is that how you think about how you were saved and how you live the Christian life? Let me give you a more accurate picture of how you were saved and how you're being saved and how I'm being saved and how any of us will be saved. You know what it more accurately looks like? It looks like this. God called you by the gospel. We all got that part right. And you, upon hearing God call you, you turned around and you walked the other direction for the woods. And so God, being merciful and gracious, called you again, he wooed you, you heard the story of the cross and the great love of Jesus, and it caught your attention. But then you just redirected for another set of woods and went the opposite direction. And so God himself came physically after you and picked you up in his arms and kicking and screaming. He dragged you all the way back to heaven. And and to this day, he's still holding you. But he wouldn't let you go, would he? Thank God, he still won't let you go because he's that merciful and because that's your only shot to make it to heaven. Lot lingered, didn't you? How many of you this morning are still lingering, having heard the call of the gospel to come out, come out, come out of your sin and be saved and you still linger? Why in the world did God save Lot? I have no idea other than verse 16, the mercy of God, which is the same reason he saved you and me. Why in the world did God save you? Mercy. Let me let me read you a quote from Spurgeon reflecting on his own life, Charles Spurgeon, 1800s London. Sometimes when I see some of the worst characters in the streets of London, the worst of sinners, awful. I feel as if my heart must burst forth in tears of gratitude that God has never let me go as far as they have done. I have thought if God had left me alone and had not touched me by his grace, what a great sinner I should have been. I should have run to that. I would have run to the utmost links of sin as far as sin can take you and dived into the very depths of evil. Nor should I have stopped at any particular sin or any particular vice if God had not restrained me. I feel that I should have been the very king of sinners, the prince of sinners, if God had let me alone. I cannot understand the reason why I'm saved except upon the ground that God would have it so. I cannot if I look ever so earnestly, I cannot discover any kind of reason in myself why I should be a partaker of divine grace if I am not at this moment without Christ, it is only because Christ Jesus would have me. I can put the crown for my salvation nowhere but upon the head of him whose mighty grace has saved me from going down into the pit. Looking back on my past life, I can see the dawning of it all was of God. I took no torch with which to light the sun, but the sun enlightened me. I did not begin my spiritual life. No, I rather kicked and struggled against the things of the spirit. Even when he drew me for a time, I would not respond. I did not run after him. There was a natural hatred in my soul of everything holy and good. All of his wooings were lost upon me. His warnings I cast to the wind, his thunders were despised and as for the whispers of his love, they were rejected by me as being nothing less than vanity, but sure as I am, I can say now, speaking on behalf of myself, he alone is my salvation. Isn't that all of our stories? If you're a Christian, he alone is our salvation, mercy alone. And that brings us to Acts 3, I keep saying Acts, which is a book in the Bible, we're not in Acts this morning, Act 3, Apocalypse, Apocalypse in verses 23 to 29, it's dawn now, the small band of refugees, just four of them, plus the angels make it safely to Zoar, I imagine a lot, I don't, I can't prove this, it's not in the Bible. I imagine Lot, his wife, their two daughters are out of breath from fleeing the city in the dark and I also can't prove this, but I imagine the angels are just fine and move a lot like Legolas in the snowy cliffs of the mountain, remember he's just sort of. The sun is peaking out now over the horizon and light begins to spread over the darkness and behind them a series of strange sounds break the silence of the night as a storm gathers over the city. A sound like rain at first and then a crackle or a sizzle and then the screaming. Verse 24, the Lord rained on Sodom and Gomorrah sulfur and fire from the Lord out of heaven and he overthrew those cities and all the valley and all the inhabitants of the cities and everything that grew on the ground. It's here, it's really happening, everything that God said would happen is now happening and everything in you now wants to turn back and look, but remember the angels had warned, verse 17, do not look back anywhere in the valley, don't look back lest you be swept away, but Lot's wife, we don't know her name, the Bible always just calls her Lot's wife. She felt a desire, a tug to look back and that desire, that tug grew stronger and stronger until she finally couldn't resist and verse 26 says, but Lot's wife behind him looked back and she became a pillar of salt. Now let me comment here, the point here is, I imagine some of you are on edge right now, the point here is not at all that Lot's wife was like some of us, like you tell me not to do something, I have to do it, whether it's OCD or otherwise. Some of you read this past and you go, I know I'd have looked back, I didn't want to, I believe God, but I know I'd have looked back, that's not the point here at all, good news for all of you, let me put you at ease. That's not what happened here to Lot's wife at all, the sense here is not that she glanced and so she was zapped by God, Jesus used the phrase and speaking of Lot's wife, she turned back. This wasn't about her eyes, this was about her heart, her heart was more stuck in Sodom than Lot's was, she preferred Sodom to salvation. She knew what the angel had said and yet she turned back and she became a pillar of salt. Now whether that was instantaneous or a slow process of being overtaken by the destruction which came, I don't know, there's lots of theories the Bible doesn't say. Josephus, some of you know that name, the early Jewish historian which gives us lots of helpful things around the book, Josephus claimed to have came across in his journeys the salt pillar statue of Lot's wife. It's not in the Bible, it's bizarre, but that's what he said, he wrote about it in his history. I do know this, salt in the biblical world was not for seasoning like it is in our homes and in our world, it was for preserving. And that's exactly what Lot's wife does for us, her story, her memory, her awful ending has been preserved for all of us as an awful witness to the judgment that is coming and to the fate of all who turn away from God's salvation. In Luke 17, Jesus warned of the final judgment to come. He said that it'll be just like the days of Noah and just like the days of Lot, people eating and drinking and laughing and thinking everything's merry and even when somebody comes and warns of the judgment they just laugh, oh entertain us some more. But then he said the son of man will be revealed and will rain down all of God's final climactic judgments and his conclusion to that warning, Luke 17 verse 32, the Lord Jesus said, remember Lot's wife. Now Moses pans the camera around and away from Sodom, even Zohar, all the way across the valley and all the cities of the valley up to the Oaks of Mamre and to Abraham, verse 27. And Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the Lord pleading for, or sorry, and verse 28 says, and he looked down towards Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the valley and he looked and behold the smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a furnace. And so it was that when God destroyed the cities of the valley, God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which Lot had lived. It was just yesterday, it's hard to believe, it was just yesterday that Abraham was speaking with the Lord, feeding the angels, pleading for God to spare the righteous. I doubt he slept much that night, just one night, now he's up early, he walks out to the Oaks of Mamre where he can see the entire valley, he sees the smoke, he sees that the entire valley has been cooked and burned. We don't know what he feels or thinks here, Moses doesn't tell. Sorrow? Hope for his nephew? Belief? Surely awe at the holy judgments of God. In scene. Which brings us finally to act four, which is, as I have in your notes, it is the epilogue, it is the closing to the story, which is why I'm treating it together with this passage, where Sodom is reborn. The story is not over, oh how I wish the story were over. I'd love to skip this last episode, which concludes this story, it's sometimes later, we're not told exactly when, is this months later, is this years later, we don't know, it's up in the hills in a cave where Lot now lives with his daughters? Why does he live there? Why did he leave Zohar after begging for it and the angels mercifully gave it to him? We're not told why, perhaps he was terrified and wanted to get as far away from the cities of the valley as he could after what happened to his people, to his wife? Talk about trauma, my goodness. But I want you to see, oh how far Lot has fallen. The man who chose the city that to him looked like the Garden of Eden, who built up power and possessions for himself, oh how far he's fallen. How empty the promise of riches and power in Sodom must feel now as Lot dwells and sleeps alone in a cave. The family's alone now and isolated, the daughters are cut off from all others and worried that their line will die out. I imagine all three of them are alone and afraid and paranoid all the time. And the daughters are wicked, truly the daughters are daughters of Sodom. Lot's wife was probably a Sodomite. The daughters hatch a plan, an awful twisted plan, they get their father drunk and so blackout drunk he has no idea what's happening to him, doesn't remember anything. They take turns consecutive nights doing the unthinkable. Sometime before, dad had offered them up as prey for a wicked and crazed town. Now his own horrible offer comes back around and in a dark irony is fulfilled in his own tent. Each daughter becomes pregnant, each gives birth to a son. The one calls her son Moab, which means from my father. The other calls her son Ben-Ami, which means kinsman. You see the horrible dark ironies of these names. Both names are awful testimonies to what's happened in the darkness and drunkenness of the night. Moses wants you to know, this is so weird, what a weird way to conclude. Moses wants you to know that this is the origin story of the Moabites and the Ammonites, cousins of Israel. You can see why, they're relatives, you can see why here, Lot, Abraham, Israel. But who in time will turn out to be foes, enemies. What an awful ending. I mean, I could not, if I tried to write a worse ending to a worse, I could not do better myself. What an awful ending. And yet, I want you to see, even here, as with the rest of this awful story, peeking through the awful darkness of human depravity is the surprising light of the mercy of God. You see, Lot's daughter gives birth to Moab and to the Moabites. Moab had children himself. His children had children and became a nation of Moabites. And one day, way off in the future, a Moabite daughter was born and she was faithful and her name was Ruth. And from her came King David. And from her came the Lord Jesus, our Savior. Unbelievable, this is how God's, the canvas God is painting here and everywhere looks. An awful backdrop of darkness and clouds and storms and depravity and death, but rays of light faintly appearing and then growing larger because our God is an awesome God. Let me conclude, I know this is a lot, I know it's heavy, but let me conclude by, more heavy, I want to conclude by telling you about four great judgments, just briefly, four great judgments in the Bible which are all connected. Four great judgments in the Bible. Number one, there's the flood. There are other judgments in the Bible besides these four, but it's probably fair to say that these four stand the tallest in the story of the Bible and they're very much connected in the story of the Bible. First, there is the flood where great, awful clouds gathered over the creation and where God unleashed a rain which drowned the earth. God wiped out the entire world, save one man, Noah and his family, rescued by an ark. Second, there's Sodom where, once again, great, awful clouds gathered over Sodom and not water this time, but fire and lightning lit up the sky and then melted the city. God wiped out an entire valley of cities, save one family. Lot rescued by two angels. And I didn't have time to show you this morning, but there are so many things in Genesis that connects those two stories. The language is the same. The stories are the same. The father being drunken afterwards and awful things. It's all the same. It's all a repeat. Moses wants you to see flood, Sodom, flood, Sodom. Third, all the way forward, there's the final judgment. When Jesus returns, the Bible teaches that those other judgments, the flood and Sodom and Gomorrah are just previews, if you can imagine, of God's final act. They, if you can imagine, pale in comparison to God's final judgment where great, awful clouds will gather once more and great, Revelation says, hundred pound hell stones will fall from the sky, along with every other calamity heaven has to unleash upon a godless people. And everyone in the entire earth and under the earth and in all creation who has not bowed to Jesus as King will be wiped out forever. But I said four, and I've only given you three. There was a fourth great judgment of God where the dark, awful clouds of all of God's wrath gathered up into a storm which all hovered over Calvary. In fact, Luke says it went completely dark, the skies did, as the sun's light failed. And that storm bearing the full fury of God's wrath stored up for the ages against sin and sinners was unleashed entirely upon God's son. He alone, our substitute, bore upon his own body and soul all that Sodom received and so much more for the sins of the world, not his own sins, for the sins of the world and for the sake of all who would trust in him. He is our ark. He is our rescuing angel. He is our only escape. He will hold us fast. By his mercy alone, even if we kick and scream along the way, that is our only hope. Trust in him today and you too can be found righteous. Just like a scoundrel like Lot was found righteous by faith alone. The judgment of the wicked is certain, so is the salvation of the righteous. Let me pray. God, wherever we are and however a message like this in your word falls upon us, speak to us, confront us, and confront us with hope and grace and draw us to yourself that we all might find rescue and make it safely home in Jesus. It's in his name we pray. Amen.
