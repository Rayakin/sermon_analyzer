I read a fascinating article last night in The Guardian called The Secret Life of an Extra. It's a short little article written anonymously and it gives an inside look into a day on set in the life of an extra or a background character in television or in film. So let me give you, read for you a few highlights from the article. Quote, on a cold spring day, a table filled with hot coffee and treats beckoned me on the set. As I reached the oasis, I was stopped and informed that this was for the talent, the real actors, and directed towards the refreshments for the other background artists like me, which I came to find out was a rickety table with a large urn of hot water and a few sugar packets and nothing else. The best aspect of the work is the catering, but obviously you aren't allowed to eat anything until the talent and the crew have already eaten. And so you stand and you stare like street urchins as they pick their way through the lineup. You aren't allowed to talk either during the takes or between the takes. Your contract specifically orders you not to ever talk to any of the actors. On one set, I had a very brief scene with the lead actor, and so I was introduced to him beforehand. I smiled and attempted small talk. He stared right through me. Until that day, I had never known anybody to literally look down their nose at me, even through me. There are many rules for supporting actors. Break any one of them and you could be immediately fired and blacklisted from the industry. And all this we do, last little snippet from this article, all this we do for $100 to $200 for a day, per day, on the set, and the faint thrill of seeing yourself on screen as a blurry outline off on the side or as a tiny figure off in the distance. The only people who pay any attention to extras like you are the other extras. We do it all for our two seconds of glory. What a life. I was recently with a pastor friend who actually used to be a token struggling actor in New York City before he became a pastor. And he just, this was last week, shared how he showed his kids how his one moment of glory where he was in one scene of a random film that nobody's ever heard of, but which is buried in Netflix, and he had like a 30 second scene where he interacts with the main characters of the story. And so 15 or 20 years later, after filming this, he showed his kids who are now old enough to see Dad. Dad on screen. Dad's famous. And he says, kids, early teenagers and younger, watched the screen and said, that's it? Yep. That's it. We're in Genesis 24 this morning. If you have your Bible, if you would go ahead and turn there, if you don't have a Bible, we have several copies we'd love to not just loan to you, but to give to you as a gift for you to read God's word. Genesis 24, we continue our series through Genesis. We'll do one more week this week. Next week, we'll get to the death of Abraham, spoiler, Genesis 25, then we're going to take a break for the summer. But we're in the middle of this series on Genesis. The world is broken from Genesis 3 on. Sin has entered into the world, but God has made these promises. All of these precious promises beginning with Genesis chapter 3, he's promised that a seed is going to come from the woman, from the line of the woman who's going to crush the head of the serpent and make things right again, restore justice and righteousness to the world. That's the first big promise. And then flowing out of that later, Genesis 12 and following, he makes specific promises to a specific person, namely Abraham and to his wife. He promises to take Abraham and his wife and his family and make them into a nation and bless them, that through them he might restore his blessing, God's blessing, righteousness to all the peoples, to all the nations. So we've got a seed who's going to come and crush the serpent, and we've got a family who's going to restore God's blessing to the earth. So what we're watching and wondering is how this is going to go on and how these two promises are going to collide. Our story this morning picks up where we left off last week, where Abraham's wife, the man and the woman of promise, Abraham's wife has just died. And so right now, as it stands, there's no mother now in the family of promise, a family with no mother. Our story this morning is a story of adventure. We read, Lindsay read for us just pieces of it because it's 67 verses. We're going to cover the whole chapter, but I'm going to again capture the highlights, but not read all of it for you. But it's a story of adventure, a daring, grueling mission that might easily fail. It's a story of love. Our passage this morning is an ancient Hebrew love story where we immediately encounter and feel our cultural distance between ourselves and these characters and between how we think about love and how they experience love. We can feel the distance, and yet it's beautiful. It's elegant. But most of all, our story this morning is a story of the surprising but steady providence of God, invisibly ruling and arranging random details, propping up surprising characters, all to accomplish the will of God and change the world by blessing the world. And so let's dive into Genesis 24. It's quite a long passage, but again, we'll look at it together in just chunks, and I'm going to show you four different scenes. We're going to look at the passage in four different scenes, beginning first at home. And we'll look at the first nine verses here at home, verses one through nine. Sarah's dead. Abraham is next, and he knows it. Verse one says he was old. He was well-advanced in years. And he's been very blessed, and he knows that, too, and so he's incredibly thankful. But now he must tend to his affairs. He's at that point in life where he has to think about his will. He has to think about life beyond his own. And Isaac needs a wife. Isaac is the promised heir, the boy who finally came, the one through whom God is going to bring about a nation, the one through whom God is going to restore his blessing to all the nations, restoring what was lost in Adam in Genesis chapter three. But Isaac is pushing 40 now and still single. He was mama's boy, as we'll see later in this passage, perhaps unconcerned for a wife, disinterested in a wife. He is the world's most eligible bachelor as it stands. And as Abraham sees it, Isaac needs a wife. It's time. And so in verse two, Abraham calls his servant to him. Moses, you'll notice, doesn't name the servant for us. Abraham is rich and has many servants. But this, we're told in verse two, is his oldest. This is the servant who he clearly trusts the most for this daring mission, which can only make us wonder, is this Eliezer of Damascus? Do you remember Eliezer of Damascus? Turn back to Genesis 15. Just quickly, hold your place. But back in Genesis 15, God is striking once again these promises, starting with a child. Abraham, you and your wife are, I know, getting older and older. You're gonna have a child through whom my blessing is gonna come. But Abraham is still seeing nothing after years of waiting on this promise, and he's old now. And so he cries out to God in doubt, Genesis 15, verse two, look at 15, verse two, God, my heir is Eliezer of Damascus. He's really saying, God, what are you doing? What do you mean through my heir? My heir, as it stands, is my servant, the chief of my household, Eliezer of Damascus. But then God assured him, no, no, no, I'm paraphrasing, this servant is not gonna be your heir. I'm gonna give you a son. I'm gonna give you and Sarah a son. And that was, you can turn back to Genesis 24 now, because I just wanted you to see, that was it. That was the end of Eliezer's cameo and all of his two seconds of glory. And so if this is, in Genesis 24, and the servant, Abraham calls to himself, if this is indeed Eliezer of Damascus, then think about it. He's been with Abraham all these years, all these decades after being adopted by Abraham and Sarah from Damascus, from his people, from his land, to serve Abraham and Sarah and to manage their household. At some point in there, in all these years of serving Abraham and Sarah, at some point he realized that if things don't change, he's this rich and powerful man's heir. Even Abraham at some point realized this and said it out loud to God, only to then be bypassed by the precious son, Isaac, the son of promise, who God indeed gave to Abraham and Sarah in their old age. Now if this is indeed Eliezer, he's nameless. Once again, just another servant in the household who's stuck by Abraham's side all these years. And now he takes center stage in this chapter and in this chapter alone, as Abraham calls him into his room and gives him orders for a mission. Look at verse two. And Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his household, who had charge of all that he had, unless Eliezer has died, this has to be Eliezer of Damascus. Abraham said to him, put your hand under my thigh that I may make you swear by the Lord. Now this is so weird and strange to us and uncomfortable to us, and that's largely part of the point. Maybe sort of akin to how we kids cut their fingers, and you don't do this kids, and make blood promises, right? The point is something significant that you don't forget, something awkward, something memorable. And so Abraham says, put your hand under my thigh that I may make you swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and God of earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell, but that you will go to my country and to my kindred and take a wife there for my son Isaac. So the servant here, you have to imagine, takes out his sticky notes, jots down all of Abraham's orders, and then he asks, well, what if she won't return with me? Do I take Isaac back to her? Very reasonable question. This is a ridiculous mission. He's going to go up to some strange woman in a strange land and tell him all this, and she's just going to come back with him? So a very reasonable question here, Abraham's response to that question is unambiguous and firm. No, under no circumstances is Isaac to go there. Why? Because God has promised this land, and Isaac is the heir of this land. So daddy's saying he must not leave this land. You see what's happening? Abraham is unwilling to risk his son getting hung up in a foreign land for love, for war, for anything else. And so the servant has his orders in full for this daring mission. Let us make note of these orders and the specifics. He is to first find a wife for Isaac. Secondly, she must not be a Canaanite. Abraham lives in Canaan. So she must not be a people of this land who worship those other gods. Third, she must come from Abraham's country. Fourth, she must specifically be Abraham's kindred. And finally, most importantly of all, under no circumstances is Isaac to go with you. That's his checklist. And in verse 9, we read that the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham, his master, and swore to him concerning this matter. Servant swears an oath. The deal was made, and off he went. These are Abraham's, what you just read and encountered, these are Abraham's final spoken words in the Bible. Next week, we'll bury him. Abraham's first spoken words in the Bible came in chapter 12. They were spoken to Sarah and recorded for us as they entered Egypt. And they were Abraham hatching a plan to present Sarah as his sister to save his own hide, giving her up to foreign peoples, foreign kings. They were the words of doubt from a scared man who had no idea about the God he was now following to the promised land. His last words here, verse 7, in response to his servant's doubts. Look at verse 7. The Lord, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house and from the land of my kindred and who spoke to me and swore to me, to your offspring I will give this land. The Lord, he will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there. And I just want to point this out in those bookends so that you can see and we can all appreciate what a glorious journey this has been, from fear and doubt to courage and confidence. This is a life of faith. God has turned this man Abraham from a coward into the man of faith, according to the apostle Paul. And I just want to point out, if you're a Christian here this morning, whether you can see it or not, he's doing the same for you if you're following Jesus. Day by day and year by year, you often, I often cannot see it. It's so gradual and so slow and involves so many pauses and bumps along the way. But the Holy Spirit, if you're in Christ, abides in you. And so he's making you new and strengthening your faith day by day. Oftentimes you don't see it. I bet Abraham didn't see it either. But look at him now at life's end. That brings us to scene two, which begins in verse 10 and runs all the way through verse 27, and all which takes place at the well. Scene two, all the way in this foreign land in Mesopotamia, at the well. Look at verse 10. Then the servant took ten of his master's camels and departed, taking all sorts of choice gifts from his master. And he arose and went to Mesopotamia and to the city of Nahor. So the servant sets off here loaded with camels. Mind you, only the rich and the richest of the rich in this day have camels. He's bringing with him the choicest of gifts, all to find Isaac a wife. Moses just breezes by this journey in verse 10. But I want you to note that this is a 400 mile journey by camel. From I've rode a, have you ever, have you ever gotten on a camel? Incredibly bizarre, amazing, uncomfortable YouTube. 400 miles from Canaan to Nahor, this journey would have likely taken at least a month. Verse 10 breezes by a month. And then arriving to Abraham's territory, his homeland, the servant spots the well right outside the city's entrance and he stops there for water. You can see in verse 11 that wells were frequented by all the young ladies in the early evening time. Think of Jesus, flash forward in John chapter four, stopping for a drink. He's thirsty. So he stops for a drink at the well. And there he's met by a woman, a Samaritan woman who came for water, which led to a most memorable conversation about living water and worshiping God in spirit and in truth. The servant here has found water to quench his thirst. And he's also found the market for all the young maidens. Arriving to his destination and finding a bunch of single ladies, mission accomplished thus far. But that was the easy part. Now the hard part. How to find one fit for Isaac, who meets all his master's checklist, including she's got to agree to come back with him, 400 miles on camel. The servant recognizes the gravity of the moment. And so in verse 12, he stops and he prays. Think of verse 12. And the servant said in prayer, and we know from later in the verses, this is recorded out loud, but he's saying this in his heart. He's praying silently. And he said, Oh Lord, God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today and show steadfast love to my master Abraham. Just pause there. What a beautiful little prayer that every single one of you can pray every single day before you do whatever you're about to do. Oh Lord, God, God of heaven and earth, the God of my father, Abraham, the God who knows my name by faith, my faith matching Abraham's faith. Grant me success for your glory, for your kingdom, whatever I do today. Behold, he continues, I am standing by the spring of water and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water. Let the young woman, watch this, let the young woman to whom I shall say, please let down your jar that I may drink and who shall say in return to me, drink and I will also water your camels. Let her be the one whom you have appointed for your servant, Isaac. By this, I shall know that you have shown steadfast love to my master. So Abraham said that God would go before him so that the servant asked God here to come through on what his master had promised. God, I'm going to ask for water. Let one offer not only water to me, let, let one young lady offer water to all my 10 camels. Now pause because you don't know anything about camels and neither do I. And actually if you do, good for you and I apologize and I would love to meet you after the service and just hear more about your story. Camels are notoriously thirsty animals. An average camel after a long journey like this could drink up to 25 or 30 gallons of water. I looked this up like five times, five different places to confirm, this cannot possibly be true. Today and then one camel, 25 to, they can go months without water. God is amazing. And 25 to 30 gallons in one drinking. The average woman carrying an average sized water jug from that day could carry no more than a couple or a few gallons of water at a time. There are 10 camels here, do the math. That's easily, ancient wells are not, it's not like, you know, you pump it down into a stairwell, dug into the ground, taking your jug and pulling it out. This is, if you do the math, no less than 80 to 100 trips down and up again, down and up again, down and up again. This is no small, this is indeed a miracle from God that the servant has prayed for. What woman, what, who would do this? This is a spectacular thing. And verse 15 says, before he had finished speaking, he hadn't even got to, in Jesus' name, amen, behold, Rebecca, a young maiden appears named Rebecca. She's beautiful, the servant sees. And so he runs to her and he puts her to the test, trusting God to show up. Before we go any further, I just want to point out one of the most fascinating things in reading and studying this passage. Moses is narrating this for you, right? And as the reader, you have special privileges in that you know things before the characters in the story know them. So you immediately know Rebecca's like checking off all these things from the servant's list, but the servant has no idea. So you know the ending, but he's living in the suspense and the drama and the uncertainty of the story. Life, as we live it, is actually much like the servant, isn't it? The ending has already been written. There's a narrator, there's a grand conductor of all things, just like in this story. But we don't know the ending of the story. We have to live in suspense, which requires faith. A little water, the servant asks in verse 17. Here's his little test, his little bait, a little water, I'm thirsty. She obliges. That was the easy part, common courtesy, basic human decency to show a famished man who's clearly come a long distance a little bit of water. But now the test. He studies her intently as he chugs his water, waiting, watching, wondering if she might be the one. Verse 19, when he finishes his water, she says, I'll draw some water for your camels also, until they've finished drinking. Now we're getting somewhere. And so she's hustling back and forth, reminds us of Abraham, remember Abraham running around tent to grounds preparing the meal for the angels earlier in Genesis. She's running around, the servant is watching her run around. Verse 21 says, he's watching her to see if the Lord has prospered his journey or not, to see if he's indeed going to answer his prayers. She sees the job all the way through, the servant has seen enough, he's impressed, he takes out the gold and he gets straight to the point. Look at verse 23, please tell me whose daughter you are. Remember the checklist, we've got check, check, check, but moment of truth, please tell me whose daughter you are. Verse 24, she reveals her identity, she's the daughter of Bethuel, the granddaughter of Nahor, Abraham's brother. This beautiful, strange young woman, a hardworking, caring servant to strangers, is Abraham's grandniece, Jackpot. So verse 26 says, look at verse 26, the man bowed his head, servant gets down and bows and worships the Lord and says, blessed be the God, the Lord, the God of my master, Abraham, who has not forsaken his steadfast love and his faithfulness towards my master. As for me, the Lord has led me in the way to the house of my master's kingdom, kinsman, jackpot, electric, unseen. This brings us to scene three, which all takes place in the house, inside Rebekah's house. And this is verses 28 all the way to verse 60, all takes place inside Rebekah and her family's house. So Rebekah runs home and she tells her family the marvelous things that she's just seen and heard from this foreigner, this stranger, this servant. He shows off all the fancy jewelry the stranger has covered her in, he put a gold ring through her nose. Young man, enter Laban, her big brother, Laban, if you know the rest of Genesis, is a shyster. He's a total, he has a way of using women around him, the women around him. Here it's his sister, later it's his daughters. Rachel and Leah. He has a way of taking those women around him and using them to his own advantage. In this case, it's clear that he smells money, gold all over his sister, and he sees an opportunity for financial gain. And so yeah, indeed, he invites the servant in for dinner immediately, he gets the meal cooked up. But I do think we should be fair to Laban here. He's also a protective big brother. Young women, Rebecca is probably a teenager here, young women should be protected and looked after by their dads first and foremost, and also by their big brothers when they have them, and when they don't have them, little brothers will have to do, especially when it comes to potential suitors, including when necessary, running off the wolves. Laban has many things here, many dubious things, but he is not less than an eager and protective big brother. And so Laban rushes out, welcomes the servant into his house, feeds the camels, washes the servant's feet, and welcomes him to the dinner table for a feast. But before eating, the servant stops the party and says he has a tale to tell. A tale to tell. From Rocky Mount. The family agrees to hear him out, and so the food must wait as the servant tells them everything. He tells them about Abraham's remarkable story, how, you know, they know Uncle Abraham and Brother Abraham and Great-Uncle Abraham has been this man who has taken away to this foreign land, but they don't know the details, and so he tells them everything, how God has made him great and made him great promises and given him a son in his old age and blessed him in every single way. He tells them how Abraham has given him orders to find the promised heir a wife and how he took an oath on his master's thigh, no less, to find him a wife. He told them about his long journey here and how it brought him all the way to the well, and he told them about his prayer and the specific signs he asked God for, and he told them about Rebekah and how she appeared while he was still praying and how she checked off every single thing from his master's list and from his prayers up to the point of being Abraham's kinsman. Well, the girl's family is blown away. I don't care how protective you are. You probably feel the exact same. You wonder if this was, this guy was lying or this is surely the Lord. They conclude this must be of God. Look at verse 50. Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, this thing has come from the Lord. We cannot speak to you about our good. Behold, Rebekah is before you. Take her and go and let her be the wife of your master's son. As the Lord has spoken, the servant returns to his bag of goodies. He retrieves more gold and costly gifts, lavishes them upon Rebekah and upon her family. Laban's greedy eyes are glistening now. And finally, the food now cold, they feast and they all go to bed with full stomachs. Awaking in the morning, the servant is eager to get back to his master. Have you ever, have you ever been sent to do something difficult and to your own surprise it worked, you did it and you're just dying to get back and show off to your family, your dad, whoever. What I got, you're not going to believe what I got. That's, that's the servant here. She's ready to roll, but Laban woke up with other ideas. Laban might've spent the entire night awake, scheming. Verse 55, her brother Laban and her mother said, let the young woman remain with us a little while, at least 10 days, at least, those words jump off the page to me, at least 10 days. After that, she may go. Now, again, if you know Laban's later schemes with his own daughters, Rachel and Leah, you can only imagine that this is a possibly fatal trap for the servant's mission. 10, 10 days isn't a big deal, 10 days sound fine, but 10 days for Laban could easily turn into 10 years. But I want you to notice and admire the servant's resoluteness. He doesn't have power here, but he's firm in his faith. He's a man of courage and conviction, and this moment required it. Could the same be said of you, by the way, when the moment calls for it from you? Faith here requires the servant to stand firm and not budge. Verse 56, but the servant said to them, do not delay me, puts his foot down, do not delay me since the Lord has prospered my way. God is, are you going to oppose God? Send me away that I may go to my master. Now they all want her to stay, he wants her to go. They settle on, what do you know, leaving it to the girl, to Rebecca. It's her life after all, let her decide. And verse 58 says they called to Rebecca and they said to her, will you go with this man? Moment of truth here. She said, as the scene turns to slow motion, as everybody, the story locks into the movement of her lips, as the dramatic music cues up, she said, I will go. Now what are these words uttered by this young virgin girl before rich servants and scheming family members? I will go. What are these words? They are the same words uttered by another young woman verbatim. Another young woman named Ruth, many generations later in the fields of Moab. She was home in Moab, this was her homeland, but her husband had just died. And her mother-in-law was now planning to return back to her homeland, which was Bethlehem, which was in Canaan, which was in the promised land, the same land that has been promised to Abraham and where Abraham now dwells. Her mother-in-law, Naomi, frees her, Ruth, to stay behind in her home and find a husband there. But Ruth insisted, no, I will go. Same words, your people, my people, your God, my God. That's what Rebecca is saying here. I will go. Your people, my people, your God, my God. These are the simple, in other words, these are the simple and yet audacious, all in words of faith, spoken by this young girl. Her parents and her brother at this point can only bless her, as they do in verse 60, and off she heads for the promised land and for her husband to be, which brings us to the final scene. The fourth and final scene, which concludes this chapter in verses 61 to 67, in which takes place in the tent. We've gone from Abraham's home to the well outside of the city of Nahor after this long journey to inside Rebecca and Laban and Bethuel's house and now back home in the promised land into Isaac's tent. Off they go on their journey. I wonder what they talked about on this long journey. Surely the promises of God, surely what Isaac looked like. I mean, there's no turning back now. Surely this was Rebecca's first camel ride, like you or me being taken across country on a private jet. Arriving in the Negev, this is southern Canaan, back home in the promised land, the caravan, my servant and Rebecca come upon in the distance Isaac. Isaac is out in the fields alone and meditating, verse 63 says. What? Why? Why are you meditating? We don't really know what he's doing here, why he's meditating. Some people even debate what this word even means. I think it's most likely that he's still mourning his mother. Verse 67 seems to imply that he's been devastated as anyone would be, but maybe especially this lone child of a mother of great age who counted him as so precious and perhaps he, her too. Surely he, her too. And so he's out under the stars contemplating life as one does and death and the promises of the God who dad knows like a friend, but who he's not yet quite encountered in the same way. The two parties spot each other off in the distance. Rebecca asks the servant who it is. The servant confirms this is his master, her husband to be. This is him. The servant runs to Isaac, tells him everything. Rebecca takes her veil we read and she covers herself. This is not just a sign of modesty. This is an ancient bridal custom. She's preparing herself for marriage. Isaac as the servant runs in, he's in a dark place, he's contemplating life, he's looking for some hope. Imagine hearing this story if you're him in this moment from the old servant and what would awaken in your heart. Just blitzing forward through this moment, verse 67, Isaac takes Rebecca into his mother's tent and he marries her. Just like that. Just like that. We don't have arranged marriages anymore in our culture and it's such a shame. This would be so much easier if we didn't have options. Now I'm kind of kidding, but the strangeness of these customs to our ears is worth pondering for just a moment. We think of love as something that just happens to you, happens upon you. We literally describe love as something you fall into like a pothole and then of course you can fall out of it on accident. You have no control. Just boom and fall in and it left me. It's this outside thing that happens and we have no control of. All we're really talking about, as we all know, is a whole lot of feeling and often, especially at the beginning, a whole lot of lust that knows nothing of sacrificial commitment or of covenant. Isaac and Rebecca, note this, they're married, they don't even know each other, which means they will have to learn to love each other. They have no other choice. Now I'm not, all kidding aside, I'm not that interested in returning to arranged marriages, but I am interested in recovering that notion which I think we've all but lost. Married couples, we're all, until we die, learning to love each other. Singles and folks dating in the room, marriage is not you surveying the other four billion members of the opposite sex and ruling all but one of them out and hoping you made the right choice. It's a commitment to understand and sacrifice and learn how to best love each other. Isaac marries Rebecca just like that and now they learn to love each other. Significant that Moses tells us that all this took place, the wedding, takes place in Isaac's mother's tent. Why is that significant? Because the princess, as God named Sarah, and the mother of God's new people, the people of blessing, has just died and so what about God's promises, that's really the question of every chapter, every scene in Genesis, what about God's promises? There's no mother. Isaac has a new wife and the people of promise have a new mother. The blessing goes on, the show goes on, the seed of the woman continues, hope lives on. That's the point of this story, do you see it? And that's the end of this story. What do you think of this story? Do you feel the distance, don't you feel the distance between our lives and our love stories and this one, and this wild love story? What characters in this story most stand out to you? Who do you most identify with in this story? I'm really just, is it Isaac or is it Rebecca? Abraham or Sarah? Romeo or Juliet? Superman? But what if you're the unnamed servant, Eleazar of Damascus or whoever he was, because the narrator literally didn't even think it important to tell us his name. You get two lines in the Bible, you and I should be so lucky, we don't get a single line, the Bible's closed, it's full, it's sufficient, you get two lines. The narrator doesn't think it necessary to include your name in your main scene. You're a minor character, you're an extra, you're a stage prop. And you're experiencing the same grace from the same God who has blessed your star of the show master for all these years. You're discovering that his God, who ordered all of his affairs and his life, is doing the same thing for you, writing your script, seeing to its happy ending. There are no background characters in the kingdom of God and in the story of God. Or maybe it's like this, there are only background characters in the kingdom of God and in the story of God, as the lamb takes center stage, and we all fall down before his throne. And isn't that enough? What could be better wrapped up into that story? There's no obvious type or analogy of Jesus in our passage, there's no prophecy in the entire chapter pointing ahead to Jesus, it's just a strange love story. God choosing a random girl and making her a bride and then writing her into his own story of redemption. And maybe that's it, that's the gospel, isn't it? God choosing the weak and the fools and the lowly, like us, 1 Corinthians 2, and sending Jesus, God's servant, to come and rescue her by his own death and his own resurrection. And in so doing, turning her into a bride, a suitable bride, a lovely bride. And bringing her into the center stage of all of history, of all of eternity, with the lamb. God, we thank you for your word, the surprise of it, the strangeness of it, which captures our attention. We thank you for Christ who's come to rescue us. God, I pray, we all pray together, who trust in your name now. We pray that any among us who do not yet know and have not yet found refuge and rescue and forgiveness of sins in Christ, God, we pray that you would cause their hearts to believe by your Holy Spirit that they too are not beyond your sight or your redemption. Draw hearts to you by your Spirit's power, we pray now, God, and we pray for all of us who trust you, God, we pray you would strengthen our trust still more. We pray these things in Jesus' name, amen.
