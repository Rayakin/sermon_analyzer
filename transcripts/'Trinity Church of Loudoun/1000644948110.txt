Thank you so much, Matt. I feel very welcomed and loved by Trinity Loudon, honestly. It's a joy to be with you this morning. I love this ancient Christian greeting that many first believers were greeting each other with. Peace be with you. And I want to begin my message with these words. Peace be with you. That's one thing that we, in our part of the world, lack a lot. We don't have much peace. And that's something that people lost a long time ago. People in the Garden of Eden, they lost peace with God. And as a result of that, they lost peace with one another, peace with the whole creation, and peace with themselves. A lot of self-hatred and self-denying in this world today. And that's something beautiful that Christ does to us. He's bringing us back. Back to Himself, back to ourselves, and back to each other. So, may the peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you this morning. And may you experience this peace as we go through our passage. The peace that surpasses all understanding. Before we dive into the passage and the text, may I ask you a very simple question. How do you feel today about your Christian faith? As you sit here in the pew, how do you feel about your commitment to the Lord Jesus? And do you feel confident that you actually can make it to the very end? And perhaps maybe you're sitting today and thinking, you know what, Taras? I'm feeling pretty okay, to be honest, about my faith and my commitment to the Lord Jesus. I tasted life from different angles. And sincerely, from the bottom of my heart, I can say with disciples of Jesus, What else can I go? You have the words of eternal life. So, I tried life, and I found out Jesus is the most precious I can have in this world. And so, it's not that I'm Alexander the Great of Christian faith. It's not that I'm like conquering and smashing all the sins and evangelizing everything that breathes. But I'm quite confident about me. I'm following the Lord Jesus. But maybe today you're sitting in an absolutely different position. Maybe you're sitting and thinking to yourself, you know what? This recurrent sin in my life that I've been battling with over and over and over and over again. And I thought a long time ago that I would overcome. Actually, it's like it's taken me over. And I'm not sure I can make it to the very end. Or this deviation in your character or the problems and tensions in your family. Or this trauma in the past that shaped you, the person you are today. Creeps a lot of lack of assurance, lack of confidence. And you can doubt whether you can really make it to the very end. But maybe you're sitting here and you're thinking, you know Taras? Honestly, I feel I'm weaker than I ever thought I will be. And I'm not sure I can make it to the very end. I want to tell you whatever camp you are at today. I want to show you how our passage from John 18 challenges both groups. It brings the comfort to the despaired ones. But also, it brings challenge to the self-confident one. So have a look. I want to take you through this story. Stories are stories. And it's a very dynamic story. A very dynamic passage. And I want to gradually, slowly take you through this passage. And I want us to feel all the tensions. Everything that is happening there. So just begin with me in the first few verses. Have a look. Like few times, John points our attention to the fact that Jesus was in this garden with his disciples. Verse 1, Jesus went out with his disciples. He was and his disciples. Verse 2, there Jesus was with his disciples. Again and again. Jesus takes disciples with him. But one thing clear in the text. Look with me at the verse 4. Jesus knows what is about to happen. He knows everything that is going to happen. Actually, he predicted in John 13 that Judas will betray him. So Jesus knows what is about to happen. He knows the betrayal. He knows the fake trial and fake court. He knows the upcoming crucifixion. He knows the upcoming death. He knows all about that. And yet, deliberately, Jesus takes his people into the place of danger. He takes his people where he will be arrested. Interesting, throughout the whole John's Gospel. When Pharisees and those in power who try to captivate him. Jesus was going to slip from their hands. Just have a look with me at a couple of passages. John 5, 18. Then the Jews began to look even more diligently. The Jews were seeking all the more to kill him. Or the next one, John 7, 13. So they were seeking to arrest him. But no one laid a hand on him. Again, they sought to arrest him. John 10, 39. Can I have back please for a second? I'm not. Again, they sought to arrest him. But he escaped from their hands. Next one, John 11, 53. So from that day on, they made plans to put him to death. And there are other passages like 734, 820, 859. When they try to seize him, capture him. Jesus would slip away from their hands. And yet here, Jesus deliberately goes into a place of danger. Into a place where he knows what is about to happen. Where he will be betrayed and then crucified. And not only that. He's not going there on his own. He takes his disciples into the place of danger. John Chrysostom aptly put it. Can I have the next one? Jesus placed himself in the garden as in prison. And so in the next scene in our passage. Because Judas knows this place very well. Because Jesus met with his disciples there many times to teach them. Judas knew the place. So he took a band of soldiers with him. Who of you watched the movie by, I forgot who was the guy who made it. Passion for Christ? Mel Gibson? Mel Gibson, did you watch this movie? Do you remember the scene when Jesus was arrested in the garden of Gethsemane? Does it resonate in your mind a bit? And if you remember the movie. There is actually quite a small group of people coming there. I think they were like in the movie around 10-20 people. Few soldiers, few Pharisees. It's a small gang of people coming. Nothing can be so far away from the truth. Because normally the band of Roman soldiers would be around 600 people. Because Roman soldiers and Roman's power knew really well how important to have power on your side. When it comes to arrest someone who is a dangerous person. Just you can have a look at the home in Acts 23. When Apostle Paul was protected by and kept by Roman soldiers. There were like 470 soldiers. There were 170 horsemen. There were 100 with spikes. Don't remember the word in English. And 200 other soldiers. It was a gang of 500 people. To kind of protect and keep Apostle Paul. So there was a massive, massive, massive group of people coming there. And if you are a fan of biblical geography. You maybe know where Kidron Valley is. So our passage says Kidron Brook. I don't know what Brook is. I had to ask Matt to translate this word for me. I think it's a little river. Other translation use the valley. So if some of you been to Jerusalem. You know that Kidron Valley is located on the eastern side of a kind of modern ancient old town of Jerusalem. And it's rather small valley. It's not something like massive. It's not something you can imagine. You can see like and you cannot see the horizon and end of the valley. It's very small. So if you have a gang of 600 people going through this valley. You will hear them really well. And so what is John is trying to do in this passage? He wants us to feel the pressure and danger. Where Jesus placed himself with disciples. It's like bunch of the soldiers marching towards arresting him. It's a dangerous moment. It's interesting that long before Jesus. There was another king who was actually betrayed in the same valley. And he was fleeing for his life. The king David when he was betrayed by his own son Absalom. He was running through this valley to save himself. And long time before that there was another massive, massive betrayal by humanity of God. You know the garden I'm talking about. The garden of Gethsemane when people betrayed God. And so here Judas decides to repeat this cycle of betrayal by people of God. Verse 5. Judas who betrayed him was standing with them. This language of standing. It's not like where your body just physically placed in space. It's more a sign of kind of loyalty. Who you with. Before that he was with Jesus. And now he's coming with this gang and he's standing against Jesus. He's betraying his teacher. And so you can feel how this darkness creeping. The darkness of human heart. The darkness of this betrayal and the danger of the whole situation. This massive group of people coming to arrest Jesus. And all the danger that Jesus disciples are in. Because think for a second. If you were looking for Osama Bin Laden and you are American general. And you were somewhere in the woods of Afghanistan. And you find in this woods Osama Bin Laden. You would not only. And like if you find Osama Bin Laden. And there is 20 other people with Osama Bin Laden. You would not only arrest Osama Bin Laden. You guys can go have an ice cream. Cheers. See ya. You would actually. You would take every single person that is with Osama Bin Laden. Right? So Jesus was like obviously he was so dangerous. They are coming. And it's not only Jesus who is in danger. But everyone who is with him. All the disciples in this danger. And you can feel the kind of tension and pressure of this passage. And then this moment Jesus came forward. And he is asking, Who are you looking for? And they say, Jesus of Nazareth. And he says, I am he. Kind of reference to Yahweh. I am Yahweh. I am who I am. I am he. I am God. They fell down on their knees. And he asked again, Who are you looking for? And they say, We are looking for Jesus of Nazareth. And he again answers them, It's me. And then he says something that is so profound and so deep. Verse 8, If you seek me, let this man go. And look at the comment that John himself gives to the event that is happening here. He is making the job of a preacher very easy. This was to fulfill the word that he had spoken. Of those whom you gave me, I have lost not one. So John describes their rest. Not so that we understand the courage of Christ. But so we will see he does it in order to save his people. He depicts this event so carefully for us. Wow, we are following a brave teacher. But so that we will see that Jesus is doing that on behalf of his people. This phrase and what he is using in verse 9 was repeated three times in John's Gospel. If you have a Bible, just turn with me very quickly. 639, we don't have it on slides unfortunately. 639, Jesus says and this is the will of him who sent me. That I should not lose any of those whom he gave me. But on the last day I should raise them up. Verse 1028, I give them eternal life. 1028, I give them eternal life. And they will never perish. No one will snatch them out of my hand. And his priestly prayer in previous passage. 1712, while I was with them I myself kept them in your name. This is a bad translation from Russian. While I was with them I kept them in your name which you have given me. I have guarded them and not one of them has been lost. Except the son of the destruction that the scripture might be fulfilled. And so what happens in this passage? It's a small picture of what happens in eternity. God the Father gave Jesus certain men and women. And Jesus himself will keep these people and he will protect them. But at what cost Jesus will accomplish that? Look at me at the verse 10. When Simon Peter he wants to kind of stop their rest. And in his moment of zeal he cut the ear of the priest's servant. And then Jesus stops him. And he says. Verse 11, put your sword into the sheath. That's a complicated language. How do you say that? Like what is that? I can say that in Russian. That's so easy to say. Put your sword into its sheath. Yeah, thank you. Shall I not drink the cup that the Father has given me? Jesus will free his disciples from the place of danger. A small picture of what is happening to them in eternity. By drinking the cup of God's wrath for them. This idea of cup and God's wrath has been repeated in the Old Testament so many times. And I want you to see a few times with me in the Old Testament. We quickly will go through a few passages. Psalm 75 verse 8. In the hand of the Lord is a cup. There is a cup with foam and wine, well mixed, and he pours out from it. And all the wicked of the earth shall drain it down to the dregs. Next, prophet Isaiah. Wake yourself, wake yourself, stand up O Jerusalem. You who have drunk from the hand of the Lord the cup of his wrath. Who have drunk to the dregs the bowl, the cup of staggering. And verse 22. Thus says you Lord, the Lord your God, who pleased the cause of his people. Behold, I have taken from your hand the cup of staggering. The bowl of my wrath you shall drink no more. And prophet Ezekiel. You have gone the way of your sister, therefore I will give her cup into your hand. Thus says the Lord God. You shall drink your sister's cup that is deep and large. You shall be loved and held in derision. For it contains much. You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow. A cup of horror and desolation. The cup of your sister Samaria. You shall drink it and drain it out. And gnaw at its sheds. And tear your breasts. For I have spoken, declares the Lord. Jesus will free his disciples. He would be arrested. He would go on this fake trial. He would be crucified. He will free his loved disciples that God the Father gave him. By drinking the cup of God's wrath. So as you are sitting today. And if you are worried. And you are asking yourself. Can I make it to the end? Can I stay faithful to Jesus to the very end? You need to see this image of arrested Jesus. Drinking the cup of God's wrath. As disciples are set free. This image to be imprinted in your mind and heart. By the power of the Spirit. And tell yourself. Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane. Drank the cup of God's wrath. So I can go free. Jesus what is saying here in verse 8. Take me and let them go. It's not only the words that Jesus is saying to some Roman soldiers. But actually these are the words that Jesus is saying to all disciples. In the centuries to come. Who will trust in his name for the salvation. Take me and let them go. Arrest me and let them run. Let them stay alive. So are you afraid? Can you make it to the very end? You need to see this picture so clearly. In another gospel this typological event. This pattern happens with criminal Barnabas. Where Barnabas set free the criminal. And Jesus is arrested, tried and then crucified. So if you think today. And you're doubting about your own power. I'm full of doubts. I'm not sure I can make it to the very end. And you're asking can I make it? You need to say to yourself. Actually I cannot make it. I cannot make it unless Lord keeps me. I cannot make it to the very end. Unless he will preserve me in his hands. The power of Satan, the darkness and the temptation of sin. Are so much more powerful than my will power. Of course I will never be able to stay faithful to the very end. Unless Lord Jesus will keep me. I'm a creature of dust. I came from dust to the dust I will return. Can I make it? Of course not. Who do I think I am? Unless the Lord Jesus will keep me. So say to yourself. Jesus went into this garden of Gethsemane to be arrested. So I can be free. He was arrested so the disciples will be free. He was crucified so the disciples can be forgiven. He went into the heart of danger to eternally protect you. Friends, brothers and sisters. You are held in the hands that shed blood for you. This is the most safe hands in the whole universe. There is no more safer place than the hands of our creator. And from these hands no one will steal you. If you are today in the Christ Jesus. But if you are not a believer today. If you are not a follower of Jesus today. I hope you see the beauty of Christian message. And the power of Jesus to save and protect the ones that trust in him. I hope you see how powerful and how merciful the Lord Jesus is towards his cowardly disciples. And why don't you come to the Lord Jesus maybe today. But maybe you are sitting today right now and you are thinking. You know what Taras. I think a lot of stuff depends actually on me. On my decision. On my will power. On my commitment to the Lord Jesus. Well you have to look no further. But look with me further in the passage. And I want to show you the best of the best of the best. Of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best. Of the best of Christian disciples. And I want to show you what the best of the best of the best. With his will power and zeal and courage and strength can do. How much this will power of self can actually protect you and save you. So with the next moment. Apostle Peter. Yeah he cuts off the ear. Jesus stops him. And then Jesus brought for questioning for this trial before the high priest Anna. I never knew actually that Anna is a man's name. In our part of the world Anna is a name for ladies. Maybe he was the first kind of liberal theologian. In fact he was pretty bad actually man. I mean like if you know Judea was when it was captivated by Roman Empire. They appointed Anna as a high priest. And he was kind of combining within himself kind of political administration and religious power. And he was so corrupted man absolutely. He himself will kind of betray Jesus and give him to the trial to crucify him eventually. His next son also be a high priest Anna. He will kill Jesus' brother James later on. So they were serving the needs of Roman Empire. Pretty bad man. So during this interrogation John often time he kind of points our attention, attention of the reader to Peter's position. He's outside, inside. He's outside of the courtyard. He's inside. He's coming to the warm up himself. And we already noticed when John is using this language of kind of your location. He doesn't care where your body is located in space. It's not like where physically you're at. It's more like with Judas for example as he was standing next to Roman soldiers. It's a sign of loyalty. It's a sign who you're with. And so John does the same kind of with Peter for reason like showing his location. So at first he's kind of outside of this court. And he's cold there. But he knows there's a fire happening there. It's warm there. But there's a price to pay in order to get there. And so during the interrogation in verse 21 Jesus asked. And Jesus answers the high priest and says, Ask those who have heard me what I said to them. They know what I said. They know what I said. It's interesting. In this very moment Peter fails to give a testimony for the Lord Jesus. As Jesus says this word, Why do you ask me? Ask those who heard me. Who listened to me. And in this very second Peter actually fails to give a testimony for the Lord Jesus. And so eventually the warmth of the fire and the cold night and acceptance by those who despise his teacher in this moment. Was much higher of importance for him than loyalty for the Lord Jesus. He stands next to them. Just warming up himself. And as he asked, Aren't you one of the disciples? And Peter is like warming up himself. I don't know him. And again he asked again and again. I don't know him. I don't know him. And remember guys. Peter is the best disciples of Jesus. It's not exaggeration. He's the best of the best of the best. I mean eventually Jesus will build the church on Peter. On his confession of course. But partially on his personality as well. It's on his confession. But on Peter. He's the founder of the church. He's the best representative of apostles gang. And yet in the moment of need. He denies his Lord Jesus. So if you're too self confident today. You have a look at him. If the one who saw Jesus face to face. Eight from his hands. Being discipled by the creator of the universe. Who saw miracles physical. And actually performed miracles himself. By the power of the name of Jesus. The guy who was on the distance of few centimeters. From the one who created everything and everyone. And himself. Yet he himself. The best disciples denies Jesus. What about me? What about me who historically speaking. So far away removed from the Lord Jesus. Of course by the power of the spirit. Through his word Jesus with me. In this very second. He's between us. But yet historically speaking. He's so far away from me. What confidence I can have within myself then. What confidence I can have about myself. The one I've never seen Jesus physically. My only hope. My only confidence can be. In verse 8. Let this man go. Take me. Of those whom you gave me. I have lost not one. This is the only confidence and comfort I can have. It's not in me. In my power. In my willpower. In my commitment. In my strength. In my devotion. In my love for the Lord. In my sacrificiality. What is the word in English? Desire to. Yeah. It's in Jesus. It's interesting. The passage naturally I think. Brings the comfort and challenge simultaneously. Let me quickly. Just take you through these two characters. That John depicts before us. Judas and Peter. Let's think about them for a few seconds. So let's think about Judas. I think in the beginning he was quite amazed with Jesus. He was delighted. He loved his teaching. Jesus. I'm all in. He probably had a tattoo on his shoulder. I'm one of the twelve. In God we trust. God bless Israel. I love Jesus. I'm all in. He was amazed with miracles. He was amazed with his teaching. But I think he never loved Jesus in the first place. He probably loved Jesus the way we love our phones. You buy your phone. And you love this little thing. You buy a case for it. Protective screen. You take care of it. You wipe it carefully. You love your phone. You actually love what the phone does for you. You love the experience. The good pictures. The quick technologies. Very quick performance. You love that you are on the edge of advanced technologies. Maybe how people look at you as you take a phone. At least this is what is happening in our part of the world. Can I worship you? Maybe it's not here. You can all have iPhones. But then three years pass. You hate your phone. Oh, stupid phone. Oh, such a slow thing. Oh, curse you. Curse you. Curse you. And you are like, I want to have a new phone as soon as I can. I need to get a new phone. And probably the same happened with Judas. I'm all in. I'm with one of the twelve. He loved Jesus. He loved the experience Jesus was giving him. He thought about possibility. Like in the future Jesus comes in power. He becomes the king of Israel. And I'll be just by his side. I will be lifted up in the society. Fantastic life. And beautiful future. But when he realized Jesus is actually not going to give him what he wants. He kicked him out. He betrayed him straight away. And to be honest, I see these seeds of betrayal not only in Judas. I see it in myself. I was talking a couple of weeks ago with the seminar I'm studying. We have one of the main professors, Tim Chester. Maybe you heard of his name. He's kind of a good British theologian, good teacher. And he writes books and sells books because he writes books. And he works with publishing agencies. And he said the same thing. He said, when I want to write something on Christology. There are normally not a single publishing agency that want to do it. And write a book and publish a book on Christology. Because it's not going to be sold well. And if you publish it, you have to go with a very short, limited amount of copies printed. Because people are not really interested. But when it comes to five ways to improve your life. Ten ways to get better. These books are sold with massive copies. So, books that are talking actually about going deeper. About the God we trust in, we believe in. Understanding His attributes, His character, His nature. Church is not really interested in. But books that are kind of very pragmatic. How I can use Jesus for my benefit. To make my marriage, my life, my stuff better. I'm all in. I'm buying these books with massive amounts of copies. It does tell something about Christianity. In modern days. And I see the seeds of betrayal in myself. He didn't love Jesus. He loved the experience Jesus was giving him. And that's a classic thing. And I think we have to search and study our own hearts in this moment. Do I seek Jesus for who He is? Or for the experience He has given me? And if so, I would suggest you to repent and seek Jesus for who He is. Because for who He is, is so precious. Where else shall you go? He has the words of eternal life. Who else will keep you safe eternally? But Jesus. Do you have other hands in this world that shed blood for you? Where else can we go? But think about for a second with me about Peter. In the first moment in the passage, he is full of self-confidence. I'm not going to let them arrest Jesus. Where is my sword? Cutting the ear of the servant. But under certain pressure, he chooses the acceptance of the crowd and warmth of the fire. Actually, twice John repeats this idea. He was warming up himself by the fire. I think John wants to say us something. He twice says it. He chooses immediate comfort at the night. Acceptance and warmth of the body in order to betray his Lord Jesus. And as I was reading this passage, I think all of us have this fireplace. We all have this fireplace where we can warm up ourselves while actually betraying actively our Lord Jesus. And I don't know what it can be for you. Maybe at the workplace when other colleagues cursing the precious name of our Lord Jesus. And you passively listening and passively participating or passively agreeing with what they say. Instead of actually raising your voice for the Lord Jesus. If you are at the university, it can happen so often in the university when students curse the name of the Lord Jesus. And because you want to be accepted, you want to be one of them. You don't want to experience this peer pressure. You're like, I'm just going to sit and listen to them. So, it's interesting how his self-confidence for a moment changes in betrayal. And it is so dangerous. Self-confidence. Nothing ruins people's life as self-confidence. Bible does want to give us confidence. But certain kind of confidence. It's not confidence in self. It's confidence in our Lord Jesus Christ. In fact, Bible want to destroy your self-confidence. That's what it does again and again and again. It wants to give you confidence in the Lord Jesus. Think for a second with me. I know that in America people obsessed with the story of Titanic. You know, with this massive crash. Massive Titanic. Massive ship that sank. And of course, what sank the Titanic was the massive iceberg. And there was a lot of warning. Six warnings to be precise. That day, 12th of April, 1912. There was like a lot of danger of icebergs in the ocean. They neglected it. But that was only the problem that. The captain of the ship. His name was Edward Smith. He led many trips for 30 years. And he boasted in his abilities. And he boasted in the power of this ship. And in fact, you can find it. He said a phrase. That this ship is so powerful. That God himself could not sink it. And as this ship sailed across the North Atlantic from Britain to the U.S. Boom! With all its self-confidence and self-assurance. It went down to the bottom of the ocean. So, it's not the iceberg actually that sank the ship. It was the self-confidence. Wrong self-confidence. Of many, many men who thought. We're going to prove ourselves to the world. We're going to prove our abilities and our power. That would ruin them. So, if you're sitting today. And you're like Peter. Full of self-confidence. And it's all up to me. Just look at Peter. He's the best of the best. As he pressed against the wall. This is what the best human abilities can do. This is the best human abilities can do. And I've seen it in myself. Three years ago, you know. When we had this stuff happening in Belarus. Election. I raised my voice. Actually, very bravely. I was protesting. I wasn't fighting for political power. But I was bravely. Kind of going to the protest. Speaking against regime. Speaking against dictators. Speaking against KGB. Going on trials. Being trialed. Being interrogated. Got a fine. And I kept raising my voice again and again and again. But then 2021 happened, you know. There were more events happening in my life. But the circle around me was kind of shrinking. KGB was building more interest around my personality. Church members were arrested. I started losing my sanity. And eventually. Between two interrogations. I left the country. I escaped. I left the church I planted. I left people. Many some of them came to faith as a result of my ministry. I left them in the time of need. And I remember in one interview I was saying that. Christians should not be willing not only to raise their voice for the truth. But also to be willing to suffer for the truth. And you know I'm standing there full of masculinity and bravado. This is what we have to do. And when the moment came. To show that I'm a true deal. To live in line with these words. I ran away. I escaped. I fled. I left my church behind. And then I struggled a lot with shame and guilt. And I thought who am I actually. I thought I'm quite a brave man. But I'm a coward actually. I left people. I left the church. And it was a very tough season. Just as God eventually restored Peter. He restored me. But I experienced what Peter. I experienced this self-confidence. Oh nothing will kill you but it. So don't look at your strength to keep yourself with Jesus to the end. Look at Him. He is the author and perfecter of your faith. Verse 9. Of those whom you gave me. I have lost not one. Let us pray together.
