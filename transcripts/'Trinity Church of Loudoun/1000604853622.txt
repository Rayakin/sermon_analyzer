You guys sound quite amazing this morning, I gotta say. I was a little nervous about that. The instruments will be back next week, but what a blessing it was and is to hear you sing. That, what we just did this morning, is how most Christians, most churches throughout most of church history would have sung. And so, it's not that we need to go back or that makes it right, but it's, as Nick said, it's our most precious instrument, our voices, and the redeemed sing. Muslims don't sing. Men don't sing outside of the church, except when they're going to war or the sports field. So, thank you for singing and thank you for singing, men. Genesis 18, if you have your Bible, you can go ahead and make your way there. So, you can have dinner with any three people, dead or alive, who do you choose? You can have dinner with any three people, dead or alive, who do you choose? A couple of years ago, a magazine posed that question to its readers. Let me read for you some of the results. Jesus, Moses, and Gandhi. Ben Franklin, Abraham Lincoln, and Prince Harry. One of those is not like the other. Bruce Farley, Nelson Mandela, and David Beckham. Robin Williams, Ronald Reagan, and of course, my wife. Aww. Ellen DeGeneres, Dwayne Johnson, and Jimmy Fallon. I'm not gonna give you my list, I don't have my list, I haven't spent enough time thinking about it, but The Rock would 100% be there. Julius Caesar, Thomas Jefferson, and Stephen Hawking. My mom who died 10 years ago, my poodle who died last year, and Mother Teresa. A poodle, poodles are not people. My grandfather, Jesus, and Martin Luther King. My dad, my mom, and my sister, all deceased. It's a fascinating, imaginary game. You guys have probably seen some version of this before. I've seen it, you know, you have 10 tables, and at each table, there's a few famous and fascinating people, dead or alive, and you've gotta pick which table you would choose to dine at. You can only pick one, and in so doing, you get to show the world how fascinating and interesting you are, because that's really the point, right? Who would you choose? Any three people dead or alive? Genesis 18 this morning, God has now, by way of reminder, refresher, in case you've missed the last few weeks or are new with us this morning, God has now entered into covenant with Abraham. They are in covenant together. We last left off, chapter 17. The covenant has been signed and sealed by the act of circumcision. God has entered into covenant with Abraham. They're bound together like a husband and like a wife in covenant with each other, and in our passage this morning, God comes to Abraham to share a meal with him, and as I'll show you in our passage, Abraham shares a meal with three guests this morning, two angels and the Lord himself, and here's what I wanna show you this morning. So a lot of ground to cover, 15 verses, but here's the big thing I'm gonna try to argue and show you from these 15 verses this morning. For those in covenant with him, nothing is too wonderful for God. That's, I think, the point of this passage and what this passage is getting at, and this matters significantly for you whether you're currently in covenant with God or not yet in covenant with God. For those in covenant with him, nothing is too wonderful for God. I'm gonna show you this and argue this with two movements in our passage, and I've given them each titles, so if you're a note taker, we're gonna look at two movements. First, entertaining angels in verses one through eight, and second, nothing too wonderful in verses nine through 15. So entertaining angels we'll look at first in verses one through eight, and then in verses nine through 15, nothing too wonderful. So first, entertaining angels. Look at verses one through eight. So Abraham believes, right, all the way back in chapter 15, verse six. Abraham believed the Lord. It was counted to him as righteousness. He's demonstrated, proven his belief again and again. Last week, last time we left off, I should say, he demonstrated once again, formally, finally, by obeying God's covenant sign and seal of circumcision, and now Abraham is back home and waiting, still waiting, nothing new, still no baby, still waiting on the promise. You can see in verse one that he's back home at the oaks of Mamre. Abraham has lived here for a few decades, ever since chapter 13, when he first separated from Lot, his nephew, when they outgrew the land. Abraham settled beneath the oaks of Mamre and set up tents beneath these trees of Mamre. Your translation might read the terebinths, these great trees of Mamre. He was known by others. We read in chapter 14, an outsider calls Abraham, at the time he was still Abram, so he calls him Abram the Hebrew, who lives before the oaks of Mamre. So all those in the surrounding region knew Abram as the guy, the Hebrew guy, that lives underneath those trees, the oaks of Mamre. Now, let me just have a little fun with you from the Bible as we think a little bit more carefully about these trees and these oaks of Mamre. Trees in Genesis, and really trees in the Bible, are a really big deal. And what you see and what we see a lot, again and again, recurring in the Bible is that trees are often where revelation happens in the Bible. So God often shows up and meets with people and reveals himself to his people and comes near to his people in the context of trees. So think of Adam in the Garden of Eden, this plush garden filled with towering green trees where we read in chapter three that God walked among them in the cool of the day. Or think of Moses at the burning bush where God reveals himself and speaks to Abraham. And yes, in the Bible, a bush is also a tree, same family of words. God often reveals himself in the Bible at a tree, at trees. In the Bible, actually the story of the Bible, one of the ways that you can look at the story of the Bible and how it works, it begins and it ends with trees. So at the beginning of the Bible, we have this really significant, massively important tree called the Tree of Life. And it's only after sin and because of sin that Adam and Eve get cut off from that Tree of Life that they lose their life and their vitality in the presence of God. But then also at the very end of the Bible, what does the Bible end with? Revelation 22, we're back at the Tree of Life once again, but now restored forever. The Bible begins and ends with a very significant tree. And guess what's in the middle of the Bible? The focus of the Bible. Another tree, a tree of wood in Calvary where the Son of God lays down his life for the salvation of all mankind. That most significant middle tree, the story of the Bible from one angle is told through trees. And so Abraham lives on a high hill, several miles south of what we know today as Jerusalem and beneath a grove of towering trees called the Oaks of Mamre. Mamre is related to the Hebrew word for seeing. Remember, what happens at trees? Revelation happens at trees. I think this is so fun and so awesome. I hope you're having fun right now. People see, God opens up eyes at trees. And so guess what happens here to Abraham beneath the Oaks of Mamre? The Lord meets with him. Revelation, the Lord comes and dines with him here. Verse eight, we read, he stood by them under the tree Abraham did while they ate. And Abraham is here at his tree, not the tree of life, but maybe a sort of new tree of life, the Oaks of Mamre. And we read in the beginning of this passage this morning that he's here cooling off in the heat of the day. That's an almost identical phrase to Genesis three where we read that God walked in the Garden of Eden in the cool of the day. A lot is happening here. Are you having fun? A lot is happening here. It's almost like a new beginning after the tree of life was lost before the Oaks of Mamre. And in verse two, we read this. Look at verse two. He lifted up his eyes, Abraham did, and looked and behold, three men were standing in front of him. And when he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed himself to the earth. And he said, oh Lord, if I have found favor in your sight, do not pass by your servant. So cooling off beneath the shade of his tree and at the entrance of his tent, maybe dozing off for the customary ancient Near East midday siesta. Yes, that was a thing back in the day and I'm 100% convinced it should still be a thing. Maybe dozing off, Abraham is suddenly startled, maybe woken up by the presence of three mysterious men standing in front of him. And who are these strange guests coming to visit Abraham? It's confusing, much like the angel of the Lord who visited Hagar in the wilderness. Remember how at moments it felt like an angel, at other moments it felt like it was the Lord. So similarly here, you read one line and you think, okay, they're men. It says there are three men in verse one. You read the next chapter, if you look at chapter 19, verse one, what does it say? It's the same characters, but it calls them the two angels then came to Sodom in the evening. And so, okay, it clearly says they're angels, but then you read other lines and it's clear that Abraham is talking to God. Verse one, the Lord appeared to Abraham. Verse two, Abraham does what he does before the Lord who's seen him a lot of times over his lifetime. Abraham does what he always does, he bows down to the earth as before God. Verse three, Abraham addresses one of them, oh Lord, so just one of them, oh Lord, if I have found a favor, or it's the same word for grace in your sight. In verse 10 and verse 13, in both places, we read that the Lord, the Lord, Adonai, speaks to Abraham. What's going on here? There's mystery here, and there's supposed to be to cause you to stop and stare and wonder, but it seems clear that the Lord, God, is appearing here to Abraham once again, the pre-incarnate Lord Jesus, maybe, probably, but appearing along with two angels, and those angels appear, as they do elsewhere in the scriptures, in the form of men. So in the next scene again, chapter 19, the two angels depart from Abraham for Sodom, but the Lord stays with Abraham. What a dinner party Abraham's having. So beneath his trees, and what do you know? God shows up to Abraham once more. Now let's look at Abraham's movements and actions and words throughout this passage, very fascinating here. 99 years old, Abraham jumps up in verse one, bows down, begs them to stay, and then what does he do? He just frantically starts running around all over the place and barking out commands for his servants to prepare for these guests a proper feast. He gives them a seat under his trees and brings them appetizers. Verse four, he brings them bread. He has Sarah bake some cakes for them, in verse six. He kills and prepares a calf, in verse seven. He serves them milk and curds, in verse eight. This is several hours long. All day he's entertaining them, and the entire time he's pictured, do you notice, as just running around frantically. Look at verse two, he ran. Verse six, he went quickly. Verse seven, he ran again. Abraham is 99 years old, running around like a gazelle. Because God's with him. And he wants to serve, he lives, this is all he lives for is these moments and these promises from God. And then finally, the best part, I think, in verse eight, he stood. He runs, he runs around, he kills things, he prepares things, and then he stands. He stood by his guests and he watches them eat. I know that's creepy in our culture, but here, he's taking pleasure in their pleasure. He's their servant, he's their waiter. Let's take a moment to appreciate Abraham's hospitality here, and if I could just say this, what I'm about to do defies every instinct I have in reading and teaching the Bible. It's like the token or cliche, you preach on Daniel in the lion's den, you preach a sermon about being brave like Daniel. It's so not the point, this is about so much more here, big God and what God's doing and the story of God. And so here, Abraham and hospitality, really? And yet, the author of Hebrews writes to churches like ours and commends to them brotherly love and sisterly love and commends to them the practice of hospitality. And the author of Hebrews cites Abraham in our passage this morning as a model for us in all churches in practicing hospitality today. Let me read for you, you don't have to turn there, but this is Hebrews 13 verse two. God's word says this, do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. One of the most fascinating, bizarre verses in all the Bible. But do you see, he's clearly referencing Abraham here. Entertaining angels unawares. This is the only passage like this in the Bible, so either he's talking about something outside of the Bible or something just crazy, or he's obviously talking about Abraham here, entertaining angels unawares. He showed hospitality to strangers, Abraham did. That's what hospitality means. The word hospitality in Greek is phyloxenia. Phylo means love, xenia, xenos means stranger. It's love of strangers. That's exactly what Abraham does here. He shows love, he shows hospitality to strangers, and the strangers turned out to be angels in the Lord. So let me indeed give you a word about hospitality. There's this fascinating thread running through the whole Bible beginning to end, which I think basically shows on purpose that the gospel went forth and still goes forth through hospitality. Think about it. Jesus Christ of Nazareth went across the earth doing what? Preaching, preaching the gospel and eating and sharing meals, always sharing meals with people that the religious people didn't think he should be sharing meals with. In the book of Acts, after Jesus has been raised from the dead and he's gone, the gospel goes forth to Gentiles, but it only comes to Gentiles, and the author of Acts, Luke, is very careful to show this, it's fascinating. It only goes forth, the Gentiles' eyes are only open, Peter's eyes are only open to understand what God is doing. Yes, yes, the gospel is for Gentiles too, only in open doors and at dinner tables. The gospel goes forth through hospitality. It's a qualification for elders, for pastors in the church. Both lists we have in 1 Timothy and Titus say that he, anybody who aspires to the office of elder or who you're considering for the office of elder or pastor must be, among other things, both lists say he must be hospitable. He must be a lover of strangers. He must share his resources and open up his life and his home. It's part of the very fabric of the church, not just elders, that means you. Romans 12, 13, contribute to the needs of the saints, Paul writes, to all the churches and all the members of the churches. Contribute to the needs of the saints and seek to show hospitality. First Peter 4, 9, Peter writes, show hospitality to one another without grumbling. Listen to one writer reflecting on early church history and how this random little movement from the Middle East and Israel took off and went viral and how Christianity spread out among the nations. Listen to how he reflects on how it happened. I'm gonna read you a long quote here, try to follow it. Hospitality had a central role in the early church as believers forged a new identity in a hostile culture. As Christians shared their meals and their resources and as they opened up their lives and homes to strangers, they formed communities that transcended and changed conventional understandings of households and expressed new understandings of social relations and political identities. The outside world then noticed and wondered, were in awe together about this odd assortment of people who claimed to be and acted as though they were family. End quote. They love Jesus and they love Jesus so much, the author is saying, the historian is saying, that these oddballs got together with other strangers, other oddballs, and they opened up their lives and their homes to them and it caught the world's attention because these weirdos who had nothing to do with each other and nothing in common with each other were acting like family. Now listen, every person has different capacities and different gifts and this doesn't need to look just one way, but I wanna commend to you and to us all, your home, your dinner table, your life is one of your greatest resources for serving your church and serving your world, even strangers. So start small, if I could just get really practical, start small, start with your church family. Who's somebody you don't know? Somebody you don't know that well or maybe who's newer to the church or maybe somebody who you think you could encourage for whatever reason, you can be really subjective here, there's no rules, but you gotta start somewhere. If I could ask you, when was the last time you invited somebody over to your home, just for the sake of pouring into them, investing in them? Or if I could speak to another angle, if you don't have a home where you can have people over for whatever reason, when was the last time you invited yourself over? Now I've commended this to college students several times and I'm very pleased to say that some of them, a couple of them especially, have taken me up on this so many times that I've had to sometimes say yes or no and then no, but I wanna encourage you and all of you to keep doing that. I say yes sometimes too, right? Sharing resources, sharing table, acting like family is how the gospel grows in our lives and how the gospel goes forth. What would it look like to view our homes and our resources, whatever you've got, whether you've got a little or a lot, what would it, this isn't just a word for the wealthy among us, what would it look like to view our homes and our resources less as personal refuges to be privately enjoyed, my little sanctuary where I get away from people and get away from work and stress in Northern Virginia and yeah, the church too, and view them more as instruments for fellowship and for mission? You could change your little world with that one shift from privacy, mine, sanctuary, to come on in. Everybody's welcome here. Now, you've gotta see this as it comes to us in Genesis. Remember, in Genesis 17, God has just sealed himself into covenant with Abraham. It's really important that you piece these passages, Genesis 17 and Genesis 18 together. God has just sealed himself into covenant with Abraham and what does Moses want us to see happens right after that, Moses, the author of Genesis. God comes to dine with Abraham. Why? This is so significant, you can't miss this. Because Abraham, God's covenant partner, is now his friend. Abraham is now his friend. I know that probably makes some of you uncomfortable. God, big God, Calvinists in the room, transcendent God, holy God, little old me, rebel me, unholy me, filthy me, but this is what God has been after since the creation of the world. Fellowship with man, friendship with man. When Adam was banished from the garden, he was cut off from God, he was exiled from God, he lost his friend, we all lost our friend and our God. Now God has pierced into this darkened world once again and he's chosen a new man for his friend and through this friend, God is seeking to bring blessing and even friendship to the world. As the Bible moves on, listen to the special way it describes Abraham. Listen to James 2.23, Abraham believed God and it was counted to him as righteousness. He's just quoting Genesis 15.6 there, but listen to this, and so James says, he, Abraham, was called a friend of God. Isaiah 41, verse eight, God says this. Listen to how God addresses his people Israel. But you Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, the offspring of Abraham, my friend. God describes this man, this random man, Abraham, as his friend. Abraham was God's friend and this is what God desires with you. Think about the words that I just said. The God of the universe desires friendship with you. Don't listen to people. If I could give you a word of encouragement and discouragement, don't listen to people who talk about God in the abstract, like a bunch of ideas to argue about for sport. Be around people and listen to people who talk about God like they know him. Be around people who talk to God as one speaks of a friend. And don't yourself settle for a religion of ideas and cold, lifeless beliefs about God. I want to know God and the power of his resurrection, the apostle writes in Philippians three. God is a personal being and he wants to know you. That is to say, he wants to befriend you. Revelation 3.20, the words of Jesus. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, hospitality, hospitality, not just to strangers, not just to church members, hospitality to God. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in, Jesus says. I will come into him and eat with him and he with me. Revelation 19.9, and the angel said to me, write this, John says, write this. Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the lamb. And he said to me, these are the true words of God. God wants you as a friend. God wants to dine with you. There's so much more to eating than you think. Eating is God's idea. Eating is a picture of so many things, including the fellowship that God wants with you. We'll spend eternity feasting with the Lord. Abraham here enjoys a preview. What a dinner party indeed. But what about Sarah? I wonder if you've thought about Sarah throughout. Last time we really focused on Sarah, it wasn't a pretty look, the way she treated Hagar, right? What about Sarah here, sort of off in the background, pretty frequently off in the background of the story as God's dealing especially with Abraham. What about Sarah? Well, secondly, I want us to look at the second scene in these 15 verses. And I wanna show you how the focus here actually turns from Abraham to his wife, Sarah. So let's look together, nothing too wonderful is the second heading. And let's look together at verses nine through 15. We've been hearing about this promise of a child to come to Abraham, to Sarah for chapters now. It's been a long time, it's been months for us together as a church. And for Abraham and Sarah, oh my goodness, they've been hearing about this promise for decades now. And here in chapter 18, here now in their 99th and 90th year, once again, the same promise is rehearsed again, now again, why? Maybe you felt that as Aaron read the passage for us this morning. Again, Matt? I could've preached this passage with chapter 16 so we could've gotten some new content, some new material. We've been talking about this promise forever. So why this chapter? Abraham already believes. Why more of the same? You shall be with the child and you shall name him. We already know the name, why? The scene is actually largely about Sarah. God is here again, dining with his friend and repeating the promise. But I wanna show you this time, I think it's clear in this passage, God is actually after Sarah. Look at verse nine. They said to him, they, that is Abraham's three special guests, including the Lord, as they're wrapping up their meal, they said to him, where is Sarah, your wife? And Abraham said back to them, she is in the tent. So what we're after here, what God is after here is Sarah's belief and really addressing Sarah's unbelief. So here's the situation. Either, there's two options here. Either Abraham believes, Abraham believed God, it was counting to him as righteousness. Abraham's been believing, fallen down, bumps and bruises all over his face, all over his body from playing the fool often, but he really does believe. He's like us, he's super flawed, but he believes, he's like us if we believe. But Sarah, either Abraham has not told her about the specifics of the promise in the boy's name, and so he's just kept her in the dark, in which case, that's just horrible, Abraham. But I think more likely, he's told her, but he's not convinced her. He's not persuaded her. She doesn't share his belief. She's moved on, she's just doing her best to parent Ishmael at 90 years old, and you can understand why she doesn't believe or she's not so easily persuaded by Abraham. The author of Genesis reminds you, in case you forgot, look at verse 11. Now, Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in years, and the way of women had ceased to be with Sarah. She's postmenopause, is all that's saying, and that's what we would say. Paul describes the situation like this in Romans 4.19 much more offensively. Listen to Romans 4.19. Abraham's body, which was as good as dead, and the barrenness, Paul speaks of, the barrenness of Sarah's womb. The word barrenness there is the same word he just used of Paul. It's the deadness of her womb. Her womb, Paul says, was dead. Paul's an amazing apostle. He never married. And so, the Lord, with the angels, here repeats the promise in verse 10 for Sarah's ears to hear. God is after her heart here and wanting to call forth faith in her too, and Sarah responds how? Sarah responds with laughter. Verse 12, Sarah laughed to herself, saying, after I'm worn out in my Lord, that's Abraham. After I'm worn out and my Lord is old, shall I have pleasure? Why did she just laugh? God wasn't telling a joke. Why did she just laugh? She laughed because this was preposterous to her. She heard God's promise. She looked at her reality, 90 years old, dead womb, dead womb, and she saw a massive chasm between those two things, and she just evaluated it like any of us would. That's ridiculous. She laughed. What's her laughter? She's scoffing. She might be scoffing in a polite way, but she's scoffing. This is the laughter of unbelief, and let me put it to you like this, and a simple, obvious thing, but maybe to get the point across to you in a different way. Sarah just heard the words of the Lord, and she laughed at them. One of the first features of our rebellion against God is our scornful attitude towards God's word. The world always scoffs at the word of God. I don't care, science, media, politicians. The world is always scoffing, always laughing at the word of God. The world laughs at its claims. There's just one God, or a man rose from the dead, or today marriage is between one man and one woman. The world always laughs at the claims of the Bible and the words of the Lord. The world laughs at the promises of the Bible. Salvation is promised, but only to those who believe. Jesus will return. That Middle Eastern man from thousands of years ago is gonna come back and rule the world, laughs at his promises. The world laughs at its warnings. There's judgment. Beware, there's judgment. Hell is real. Hell is eternal. The world laughs. But what about the church? What about us? What about you and your attitude towards God's words? We would never mock it. We know better than that. But what difference is it if we just ignore it or ignore parts of it, the uncomfortable parts, the unbelievable parts, the hard parts? What difference if we neglect it? What difference if we refuse to obey it? God give us, the people of Christ, God give us faith to live by his promises, and that means to live by every one of them. I love the Lord's response here to Sarah's laughter as I study this passage all week long. It's the feature that keeps pulling my eyes and probably your eyes too just to this one thing like magnets in these 15 verses. Look at verses 13 and 14. She laughs. She laughs to herself on the other side of the tent, by the way. How did, it wasn't audible. The text doesn't seem to suggest it, but this is the Lord who sees our hearts. God sees everything you're thinking and responding to right now in your heart to the words of the Lord that I'm preaching to you. God sees all. And the Lord said to Abraham, why did Sarah laugh? And say, shall I indeed bear a child now that I am old? Is anything too hard for the Lord? I want you to pause and stare at that little phrase, that question, which is not answered because it doesn't need to be answered. It's a rhetorical question. It's written here. It's a sermon and a question. Is anything too hard for the Lord? The word hard there can also be translated and often elsewhere in the Bible is translated as wonderful so that the question could be retranslated or restated. Is anything too hard for the Lord? Is anything too wonderful for the Lord? It's the same word used elsewhere in the scripture. King David pondering how deeply God knows him, writing of singing, praying, how God knows him inside and out. God knows the words that are gonna come out of his mouth before David's even thought to say them. David's pondering those thoughts of himself and the bigness of God and he says, Psalm 139, six, such knowledge is too wonderful for me. I cannot attain it. Same word. Prophet Isaiah, writing of a king to come, who would sit, he says, on David's throne and establish righteousness and peace forever for everybody. He writes this, for unto us a child is born and unto us a son is given. We sing this song around Christmas time. And the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor. Same word. Is anything too hard for the Lord? Is anything too wonderful for the Lord? When the Lord Jesus came, one of his titles was Wonderful. Same word, Wonderful Counselor, Isaiah 9, six. Is anything too wonderful for the Lord? Too hard for the Lord? Impossible for God. Anything, is anything out there impossible for God? Let me ask you a personal question. You can answer it privately in your own heart. What is the most difficult situation, most difficult circumstance in your life now, today? Might be for years, might be new. What's the most difficult situation, circumstance in your life where you most struggle to trust God and to believe his promises? What affliction, what relationship, parent, child? What sin struggle? What friend, what child, what at work? What is the thing in your life that most stokes your fears, your anxiety, your unbelief? For Sarah, it was this promise of God, this nagging promise of God that she's been hearing for years and years and years now and weighing that against a dead womb. Some mystery what it was for Sarah. That was big. It was impossible, Sarah thought. It was insurmountable to her. It ruled her life until she finally, it's clear here, she just gave up on it and she moved on. But it wasn't for God. What ruled her life was nothing for God. What rules your life and feels impossible is so small, is nothing for God. The Lord specializes in the impossible. Only now, listen, only now that she's 90 years old, only now is he ready to extend his arm and perform this miracle just to prove the point that it's not by her, it's not by him, it's not by things we can understand, it's not by things we deem easy or possible. Only when it's impossible is God ready to act. At the appointed time, I will return to you, verse 14 says, about this time next year, and Sarah shall have a son. And she's gonna name the son, what's she gonna name the son? She's gonna name the son Isaac. Laughter. Jewish kids running around, laughter, come here, laughter, come play with us, laughter, why? To commemorate this moment forever so that Sarah and Abraham and all future generations would never forget the silliness of what? The silliness of doubting God's words and God's promises. Fast forward, I'm gonna spoil this story for you right quick, it's okay sometimes to do that in the Bible. Fast forward to chapter 21, verse one, we'll be there in a few weeks. The Lord visited Sarah, the Bible says, as he had said he would. And the Lord did to Sarah as he had promised. The Lord did to Sarah as he had promised. And Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age at the time of which God had spoken to him. Life came into her dead womb. And she bore the son and she named him Isaac, why? He's the God of the impossible. Much later it was another word from God promising another baby to another woman of similarly impossible circumstances. This time it was not an aging woman with a dead womb, this time it was a virgin who'd never been with a man. And life came into her virgin womb and she too bore a son. She named him Jesus for he will save us from our sins, why? Why the virgin? Because he's the God of the impossible. Much later than that, the Lord Jesus walking, talking, serving, ministering, talked about yet another birth which we all must undergo if we want to be saved and if we want to be safe in God, the most unlikely and most impossible birth of all. The Lord Jesus said to a teacher of the law named Nicodemus that if you want to see the kingdom of God, you must be born again. And the teacher of the law looked back to the Lord Jesus and he said, what, I'm gonna go back up into my mother's womb for a second time? It's bizarre, crude, gross, but what's he saying? He's saying, impossible, nonsense. And that's exactly the point, why? Because he's the God of the impossible. And so today and then and until Jesus returns into dead rebel hearts, God brings forth life and faith and salvation. That's the ultimate question for every one of us here this morning, have you been born again? Have you received the second birth, the new birth? Is your life any different from what it was before you received this second birth? It must be. Do you desire God? Do you trust God? Are you really following him? Jesus wasn't talking about just a new claim to believe. Yeah, okay, Jesus, Jesus is God's son, check, believe that, amen. He was talking about a total overhaul, upheaval, death to life, new birth, is that you? Does that describe your life, your story? If that's not you, listen to me carefully. If that's not you and you know it's not you, maybe you're realizing at this very moment it's not you, you've gotta make your way to that tree in the middle, why? Because there is God, remember, God in the story of the Bible reveals himself in trees and there at that middle tree of Calvary, God can be seen. And what is God seen as there? Suffering, abandon, expiring, dying. God, the king who died to take your sins away, and listen, he'll take them all away and cleanse your life, your soul if you'll just give him yours. And believe, he'll become your covenant partner, that is to say, your friend, savior, if you'll believe. Believe this morning, today is the day of salvation. Now, I don't wanna leave you this morning with the wrong impression of Sarah. The Lord came in this passage, as I suggested earlier, for her heart and his word was met with laughter, shame on Sarah. But he didn't leave without her trust, and we know this because the author of Hebrews makes it clear, and so I wanna close by reading just a couple of verses from Hebrews to show you how Sarah finished the story as Hebrews puts Sarah in the hall of faith, the hall of the faithful. Hebrews 11, verses 11 and 12 say this. By faith, Sarah, not just Abraham, Sarah herself received power to conceive, even when she was past the age, since she, Sarah, considered him faithful who had promised. Therefore, from one man, and him as good as dead, were born descendants as many as the stars of heaven, and as many as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore. The Lord came to her, visited her along with Abraham, and the Lord did not leave her until he had her trust, until he had her heart. Now they both believe the promise. Now they're both in covenant with God. And so for them, nothing is too hard. Nothing is too wonderful. Why? Because they're friends with the God of the impossible. And so what about you? What's that most difficult situation and circumstance in your life where you're most struggling to trust God and believe his promises? That gigantic, impossible thing, that chasm? To you, not to God. To him, it's a small thing. Let's trust him together today. For those in covenant with him, nothing is too wonderful for God. Amen? Let's pray together. Oh God, as we so often pray in response to your word, we believe, but help our unbelief. Strengthen our belief. God, we're each thinking of relationships and family, of sins, of impossible situations at work or in life, or even afflictions or sicknesses or ailments. God, help us to look afresh this morning to you, our God and our king and our savior and our friend, and help us to find you as our friend. Come to us, meet with us now, we pray. Dine with us, oh God. We trust in the Lord Jesus. Come and meet with us, we pray. God, for any who are not yet in covenant with you, God, we pray that you would awaken faith in them just as you gave faith to Sarah and to Abraham. Just as you knit life in their wombs, God, would you awaken faith this morning. We pray all these things together in Jesus' name. Amen.
