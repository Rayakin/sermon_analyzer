One of the things that the book of Hebrews does so well is that it establishes Christ as supreme above all things. So it has what we would call, in theological circles, a high Christology, which means that there is a heavy emphasis on the divine nature and work of Christ, which is similar to many other passages in the New Testament, such as John 1, Colossians 1, two examples. And one of the primary themes that we see throughout the book of Hebrews is the supremacy of Christ over all things. So for some of you note takers, the supremacy of Christ over all things. And specifically, these all things that Christ is supreme over are areas where first century Jewish Christians would have struggled. Hence the title. It's a letter written to the Hebrews. The writer is unknown and very much debated, but the writer is speaking largely to Jewish Christians who have now come to faith in Christ. Praise God, that's great. But who would have had a strong understanding and connection to the Torah, the law, Hebrew poetry, the festivals, the temple, the Passover, the Exodus. All of these things would have been so foundational to the readership of this letter. And it's made obvious in the way that the writer tackles these various issues. These things that Christ is supreme over. And specifically how each of these things, important as they are, how they each submit to the lordship and the rule of Christ. The kingship of Christ. The supremacy of Christ over all things. And before we dive into our specific verses today, I wanna give us a very quick high level roadmap of the book of Hebrews as we begin to undertake this book as I Lord willing walk you through it when I get to preach in future dates. So first we said that Christ is supreme over all things. But what are the specific things that Christ is supreme over that these, honestly these Jewish Christians would have struggled with? Well, Hebrews gives us four primary things that we see. Number one, Christ is supreme over angels. Christ is supreme over Moses. Christ is supreme over and fulfills the priesthood. And then fourthly, Christ is supreme over and fulfills the Old Testament sacrificial system. So again, Christ is supreme over angels, Moses, priesthood, Old Testament sacrificial system. And all four of these statements would have honestly made your average first century Jewish person pretty uncomfortable to hear this. So the author really does have his work cut out for him. And then in light of Christ's supremacy over these things, the author of Hebrews in chapters 11 to 13 at the end gives us a word of encouragement to persevere in this faith where Christ is the centerpiece, right? To persevere well in this Christian faith. So Christ is supreme over angels, Moses, priesthood, sacrifices, and then we're encouraged to persevere and to not neglect the faith that rests firmly on Jesus, on Christ. So that's the 30,000 foot high flyover of Hebrews. And again, that'll be our general heading as we tackle this in future Sundays, Lord willing. But for today, we're gonna be in chapter one, verse one to four, as we've read. And we're asking the question coming off the heels of Christmas, what child is this? What child is this that we've been singing about, celebrating, talking about the past six, eight weeks or so? Hebrews one, one to four helps us to see that although he, this child, was veiled in humility, Jesus, he is infinite in his worth, his power, and his glory. And for today, I've actually got eight specific points. Don't worry, they're quick points. We're not gonna spend, please, please don't be nervous. But eight specific points because it is such a dense text, it's so good, that shows us exactly who this child is. What child is this? Let's take a look. Verse one. So we said long ago, and in many times, and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, but, right, there's the pivot, in these last days, he has spoken to us by his son. So quick bit of background. The prophets in the Old Testament were the mouthpieces of God, right? These were men appointed by God to bring God's messages of encouragement and warning and truth and exhortation to the people of God, to Israel, and to Judah. So through the word that God gave them to proclaim, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, they spoke to God's people. They brought his revelation, like here's what God is saying, here's what he's like. And so when you think of the hierarchy of authority in God's revelation in Israel, it would have been Moses, Abraham, kind of David in a unique way, and then the prophets. And to put any person or any revelation above these would have been blasphemy, especially Moses, which writer of Hebrews tackles later. So right at the outset of this letter to Hebrews, the newly converted Jewish Christian would have read this very first verse and likely started to sweat a little bit, especially since the author then goes on to say, you know, here's how God used to speak, but now, in these last days, the clearest revelation of who God is has now come to us by the Son, by Jesus, right? He is supreme over all past revelations. He's got the trump card. And we see Jesus himself many times in the Gospels affirming this with the disciples, with Pontius Pilate. My personal favorite is in John 8, where Jesus makes a clear allusion to his divinity by saying to the Pharisees, before Abraham was, I am, which then they just lose their minds. It's a great scene. Of course, because I am being the way that Yahweh referred to himself to Moses at the burning bush, scandalous. But this is what Hebrews and this is what Jesus affirms. So what child is this? Point number one, Jesus is the one by whom the clearest truth and revelation of God comes to man. Jesus is the one by whom God's clearest truth and revelation comes to man. God speaks to us by the Son. Verse 2b, so we're chopping this up. Whom he, the Father, whom he appointed heir of all things. Man, I love this one. This might be my favorite. So it's implied in the text that God the Father appointed Jesus to be the heir of all things, the entire created order, and it was proven that he is the rightful heir and worthy because of what he accomplished at Calvary, right, defeating death, securing our gospel hope. Jesus is now, because of that, he is seated at the right hand of the Father, ruling and reigning. Hebrews 10 and 12 both speak to this. So he accomplished what he set out to do, coming to earth as a man, as a child, and now all rule, authority, dominion, and power belongs to him. So Jesus is the rightful heir of all things because of what he accomplished at the cross. That was proven to us. But he's not just the heir of the created order. He is also heir of his church, his bride. I love how this concept connects to Revelation chapter five. If you have your Bibles, you can turn there, very end of the Bible, Revelation chapter five. Very quickly, in this amazing chapter, we see this imagery of a scroll with seven seals on the scroll. And an angel of the Lord asks if anyone is worthy to open the scroll, but then says that there is no one worthy to open the scroll on heaven and on earth. So the apostle John, witnessing this vision and writing the book of Revelation, he begins to weep. And why is this? Why is this scroll so important that he weeps because it cannot be opened? Many scholars believe that in the ancient Near East, in this time, that a seven-sealed scroll was a scroll of inheritance, a document that would outline what you were to inherit from a family member or a loved one. So look at this now in Revelation five, verse five. It says, one of the elders in heaven, again, this is a heavenly vision. One of the elders said to me, John, he said, weep no more. Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has conquered, referring to the gospel, to Calvary, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals. Because of what Jesus accomplished, he is now worthy. And so the lamb which had been slain, which is Jesus, he takes the scroll from the father who is seated on the throne. And as he does, the angels and the elders fall down and worship, and they sing a new song. And here's the song that they sing. Listen to this. Verse nine, they sing, worthy are you, Jesus, to take the scroll, to open its seals, for you were slain, and by your blood you ransomed. Pause right there. What does he ransom? What does he receive back to himself as his rightful inheritance? People for God. From every tribe and language and people and nation. Verse 10, and you have made them a kingdom and priests to our God, and they, humanity, shall reign on the earth. Beautiful. And so John is weeping because there's no one worthy to open this inheritance scroll. There's no one who can make a way for God to receive back to himself his rightful inheritance, which is sinful humanity, until one comes. One like a son of man, who is infinitely worthy to redeem and to win back what is rightfully his. Namely, people for God, his church, his bride. So, they're not all this long, I promise. Point number two, what child is this? Number two, Jesus is the rightful heir of all things. That includes the created universe as well as his church. Verse two, through whom he, Jesus, also created the world. Back to Hebrews. So, we said on point number two that Jesus is the heir of all things. Well, part of why that is true is because Jesus is the one who created all things. A lot of people aren't as familiar with this incredible concept, but we just actually read about it in John 1 at our Christmas Eve service. John 1, verse 1 says, "'In the beginning was the Word,' this is a reference to Jesus, "'and the Word was with God and the Word was God. "'He was in the beginning with God, "'so eternally with God, all things were made through him. "'And without him was not anything made that was made.'" So, without Jesus, it's saying, nothing that we see in creation would be here, would exist. Colossians 1, 16, "'For by him, Jesus, all things were created, "'in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, "'thrones, dominions, rulers, and authorities. "'All things were created through him and for him.'" So, there's that inheritance language again, right? He created, and therefore, it is rightfully his. We've been asking the question, what child is this? And the disciples also asked this, a similar question of Jesus in Luke 8. This is the famous story of Jesus and the disciples on the Sea of Galilee. Huge storm comes up. The disciples are afraid Jesus is sleeping. They wake him up. He says, be still. And the storm quiets, stops. And then the disciples, amazed, they ask kind of a similar question to what child is this. They say, who then is this that he commands even the winds and the water and they obey him? Well, it's Jesus, the one who created the winds and the water, who created all things. So, of course, their obedience to him would be sure and immediate. I know we have our kids in the room today, which they are amazingly behaved. Let me just point that out. So, kids, one of the amazing things that the Bible tells us is that Jesus, before he was a baby and came to earth, he was with the Father and that he created everything, the world, the trees, the mountains, the animals, outer space, everything. It's incredible. What child is this? Point number three. Jesus is the creator of the universe, the creator of all things. Verse 3a. He, Jesus, is the radiance of the glory of God. This idea of glory can be kind of murky and we're not sure what to do with this sometimes. I love John Piper's definition of what glory is. It's helpful. And here's what he says about glory. Piper says, I believe the glory of God is the going public of his infinite worth. I define the holiness of God as the infinite value of God, the infinite, intrinsic worth of God. And when that goes public in creation, whether that's a beautiful sunset or a waterfall or whatever it may be, a child you're holding, the heavens are telling of the glory of God and human beings are manifesting his glory because we're created in his image. We are image bearers, imaging, reflecting God. The public display of the infinite beauty and worth of God is what I mean by glory. So God's glory is the radiance, it's radiating out of his holiness, the radiance of his manifold, infinite, worthy, invaluable perfections. Such a great definition. God's glory is his holiness put on display as we see it and experience the going public of his holiness, his otherness, his set-apartness. And so to bring it back to Jesus, this child, Hebrews tells us that he is the most radiant, the most explicit expression of his holiness. And this is why the angels come to the shepherds and sing glory in the highest. Because Jesus has come, which is so interesting when you consider the way in which he comes to earth, right, as a poor child. What does that tell us about God? The unfathomable depths of his humility and his love and his holiness that he would come down, that he would condescend to our lowliest state. What child is this? Point number four, Jesus is the most radiant expression of God's glory, the most radiant expression of God's glory. Verse 3b, he is the exact imprint of his nature. I feel like in today's society and pop culture, it's really tempting to view the Father and Jesus in two totally different camps and maybe even at odds a little bit. Here's what I mean. I think people tend to view the Father as being this disapproving old curmudgeon who's looking down from heaven, who's just waiting for us to screw up and then smite us when we make a mistake. And then at the same time, I think there's a tendency to view Jesus as this nice kind of hippie, mild-mannered, kind of wimpy, kind of weak guy with long hair who's definitely way nicer than the Father. So kind of polar opposites, right? And even though we might make light of this or even laugh at this caricature, I think we need to be on guard for ourselves that we don't allow this view of the Father and the Son to inform our understanding of God and his true nature. Because Hebrews says that Jesus is the exact imprint of the Father's nature. Colossians 2.9, I love this one. It says, for in him, Jesus, the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily. Right, so in Jesus, the fullness of the nature of God the Father is dwelling in Jesus physically in bodily form as Colossians, as Paul tells us in Colossians. So you wanna know what God the Father's like? Look to the Son. What is he like? How does he speak? What did he do? Where did he go? How does he approach people? How does he approach sinners? How did he pursue people in love and truth? The fullness of God in bodily form, holy and set apart absolutely and yet compassionate and laser focused on bringing redemption to humanity. Don't miss the beautiful harmony, the righteous unity that exists between the Father and the Son. Distinct in their personage and yet the same in their nature. And Jesus himself talked about how unified they were in his high priestly prayer from John 17. Great passage, go read that. So what child is this? Point number five, Jesus' nature is the exact imprint of God the Father's. Verse 3c, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power. So we've already looked at how Jesus created all things. He created the universe and people just by speaking them into being. We also see here that Jesus sustains all of the created order by his very words. Deism is the belief that God created all things, set creation in motion but then backed away and is uninvolved in the world and in our lives. But as Christians who trust in what God has said to us in the Bible about himself, we would disagree with this. We believe that God is Emmanuel, that he is God with us, present, and that the arrival of Christ as a child proves this. And so it's crucial as the church that we remember that God is present, that he sustains the church actively, and that he sustains all things including his church. He is near to her and his spirit gives witness and strengthens and empowers and illuminates and calls to mind the promises of God and the words of Jesus. John 15 tells us this. How encouraging is that for us who walk with Christ? When our problems and our burdens feel overwhelming, we can rest in the one who sustains the universe by his mere words. And if he sustains the universe, if he feeds the birds, if he clothes the lilies, how much more does he love us? Of how much more value are we? And how much more can he sustain us throughout the seasons of life? So speaking again to our Trinity kids, kids, we're so glad you're here. If God is strong enough to hold together the universe, the planet, and to keep the sun shining and keep the oceans where they're supposed to be, then he's strong enough to help you in your life. He's strong enough to bring you encouragement when you're feeling sad. And he can give you the strength that you need when you are afraid. All Jesus calls us to do is to trust him, to pray to him, to seek him, to cry out to him, to ask him for help. And he wants us to do this. He wants us to talk to him, to bring our questions to him, and to seek him out because he loves us. Jesus is the word in John's gospel who then creates and sustains all things by his word in Hebrews. So what child is this? Point number six, Jesus is the sustainer of the universe and his church. The sustainer of the universe and his church. Verse 3D, after making purification for sins, it's a really, really short segment right there. Obviously, it's a bit of a fragment, but it's implying that Jesus has made purification for the sins of man. And it's alluding to what Hebrews addresses later on about how Jesus sacrificed once and for all at the cross was sufficient to bring purification from sin to all who place their faith in Christ. So this is the gospel, plain and simple. And Jesus was the only one who was worthy to make purification for sins, to atone for sin, because he alone is an infinitely worthy sacrifice. Some of you might have heard the illustration before where, let's say, if you slap your brother in the face, the consequences will be somewhat minimal. You might have a family feud or something. If you slap a police officer, you'll get taken to jail. If you try to slap the President of the United States, it's not gonna happen. You're gonna get taken out by Secret Service, right? So the status of the one being offended dictates the severity of the consequences. Do you see that? So then if we zoom way out, if we offend in sin against a God who is infinite, holy and perfect, then it makes sense that the consequences are also infinite in nature, which means that we could never make it right since we ourselves are finite. And in fact, the only way to make it right is to have an equally infinite sacrifice that is sufficient and effective to atone for this wrongdoing, right? This is why, to quote Hebrews 10, this is why the blood of bulls and goats ultimately isn't effective to take away sins, why the Old Testament sacrificial system alluded to and foreshadowed a better sacrifice. It's why the writer of Hebrews goes to great lengths to explain to these new Jewish Christians that Jesus is the better sacrifice, the necessary sacrifice, who had to come if we were to have any hope. The sacrifice would had to have been infinitely perfect and spotless and righteous in its nature in order to somehow atone for this great injustice of sin against a holy and infinite God. And then one night in Bethlehem, the baby cries in a manger. Jesus lived his life and he was found faithful and he did it. He made purification for sins. So what child is this? Number seven. Jesus is the only infinitely worthy sacrifice whose blood atones for sins. The only infinitely worthy sacrifice whose blood atones for sins. And then lastly, verse three and four. So he did all this and then he sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high, having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs. There's that inheritance concept again. And so because of our last point that Jesus made purification for sins by accomplishing what he set out to do with the cross, he fulfilled his mission. He ascended into heaven in Acts one and he has now taken his place at the right hand of the father as was in accordance with his will and plan. And all of the son's power and majesty, this was all true already in eternity past, but now through the life, death and resurrection of Christ, we have seen it, we have witnessed it, we have tasted it. We have beheld his power, his worth, his glory. And so we are witnesses to it and we attest to it and we are called to proclaim it, to proclaim all the things that we've learned even here today about the son from Hebrews chapter one. And then verse four ends with this little note on angels. Don't have time to go here today, but it's really the writer's intro statement into making the argument that Christ is supreme over all things, thing number one being angels. And so we'll address that at a later date. Looking forward to that. But what child is this? Point number eight. Jesus is now ruling at the right hand of God the father. Presently, today, right now in this moment, reigning and also, praise God, interceding on our behalf. He's pleading our case by his blood before the father. That is good news, man. Church, Hebrews one, one to four highlights the supremacy of Christ and it truly is a call to see, to worship and to adore and stand in awe at the son. So what child is this? I'm gonna recap these eight points real quick just so you can get them. Number one, Jesus is the one by whom God's clearest truth and revelation comes to man. Two, Jesus is the rightful heir of all things. That includes the created universe as well as his church. Three, Jesus is the creator of the universe. Four, Jesus is the most radiant expression of God's glory. Five, Jesus's nature is the exact imprint of God the father's. Six, Jesus is the sustainer of the universe and his church. Seven, Jesus is the only infinitely worthy sacrifice whose blood atones for sins. And then number eight, Jesus is now ruling at the right hand of God the father. As we close, I wonder which of these points about Jesus, about this child who came, draws your affections towards him. Which of these points most calls your attention to the word of heaven, the word of heaven word? Maybe the fact that he's the creator or the sustainer of all things. Maybe that he's the exact imprint of God himself, the father, or the one by whom the father has chosen to most clearly reveal himself. Or that he alone was worthy to make purification for sins. That he is strong despite our weakness. Whatever it is, I encourage you to think about this, and to look at it to him. And then for our kids in the room, which of these things that we've looked at about Jesus was most amazing to you? Maybe that Jesus created the world. Maybe that Jesus gives strength to us. Or that he came to earth because he loves us. Parents, perhaps you can even talk more about this with your kids on the way home, in the car ride home. As we consider this child and who he is, what is it about our savior that moves you to a greater love and affection for him? Let's pray. Father, thank you for revealing yourself. Thank you that we're not wandering in the dark. Lord, I even thank you that we have the unique blessing of being new covenant Christians. We're not in sort of an intertestamental kind of waiting period. And obviously those people were appointed for that time, but I just feel blessed that we have seen the son, and we have your scriptures, and we have everything that we need to make us wise unto salvation, and to encourage one another in these things. So would you do that this morning? May we think well and think rightly, Lord, about which of these attributes most calls us to worship and to glorify you with our lives and with our lips. And so help us this week to meditate on this and to consider more deeply who you are as you came to earth as a child. We love you, amen.
