Point one, declare Christ. Subpoint A, 1 Corinthians 2.2, I resolve to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified. Subpoint A, one, one greatest dangers of standing in pulpit week after week, same people, son after son, year after year. Number two, temptation to be innovative, novel, clever. You will feel that pressure. Subpoint A, three, pastoral ministry is a ministry of reminding, not innovating. Subpoint A, four, preach Christ, teach Christ, remind your people of Christ. Subpoint B, Peter, I will always remind you, remind you, remind is underlined, of these things, even though you know them and are firmly established in the truth you now have. I think it is right to refresh your memory, refresh your memory is underlined, as long as I live in the tent of this body, so I will make every effort to see that after my death you will always be able to remember, again, remember is underlined, remember these things. Subpoint B, one, not called to preach ideologies, not called to impress people with our learning, called to preach JC and him crucified. Subpoint 1B, remind them what we are in Christ, what we are outside of Christ, what we were outside of Christ, one day unite to Christ. Subpoint 1C, man's fault, dot, dot, dot, need new birth, dot, dot, dot, work of Christ atonement, dot, dot, dot, power of spirit to enable, to become what we are. Subpoint B2, preach Christ. Every time you preach, never preach a sermon in bold, never preach a sermon without preach Christ. Subpoint B2A, what make a sermon Christian, dot, dot, dot, preaching Christ. Let's pray. Just kidding. Those are the shorthand notes from the outline that Pastor Stephen Karn of Hamilton Baptist Church gave to us for about 10 minutes, a little more than four years ago in Creighton's Corner Elementary School over in Brambleton as we held our very first public gathering as the Trinity Church of Loudoun. After the service, I saw him, I gave him a hug, I thanked him and I asked him, could I have these? And these are his actual notes. And I stashed them away and last night, by the grace of God and a labor of love for you, I dug them up, found them in a little file cabinet I have at home and here they are. And they have, as you can see, a large coffee stain on the bottom, which I have no idea if that's mine or his, but I sure hope it's mine. And so, that's what I intend to do this morning, to remind you. Some of you here this morning are dabbling in sin and maybe inching deeper and deeper into sin. Some of you here this morning facing very serious temptation right now and maybe temptation that nobody else at this point but you knows about. Some of you here this morning are believing lies and questioning the truth and more and more every day, questioning the truth. Some of you here this morning are living in guilt and condemnation and change, shame, which will not go away no matter how hard you try. All of us, wherever we are this morning, need a reminder of the gospel. And so, that's what I intend to do this morning. So, if you have a Bible, turn together with me to 1 John at the very back of your Bible. If you get to Revelation, you've just barely gone too far. And we're gonna look together at just those two verses which Juliana just read for us by way of a reminder here at the beginning of a new year before we jump back into Genesis next week, a reminder of the gospel. And the main point that I wanna show you from these two verses this morning, if I could give it to you like this, here's the main point. You have to stop sinning and you have to know where to turn when you do sin. That's the main point from these two verses. We're gonna see it together this morning. You have to stop sinning. I have to, if you're a Christian, you've gotta turn away from your sin. You've gotta stop. And you have to know where to turn when you do sin. So, my outline, our outline for this morning, if you're a note taker, first, Christians must turn from sin. Second, sinning Christians must turn to Christ. Christians must turn from sin and sinning Christians must turn to Christ. Let's dive in. Chapter two of First John, verse one, point one, Christians must turn from sin. My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. John is the author of this letter, which bears his name. He is the oldest of the apostles. In fact, by this point, he's outlived all of the other apostles, those blessed eyewitnesses and friends of the Lord Jesus. And you can see he writes here to these scattered, seemingly interdependent groups of little churches around Asia. And he writes to them as a tender authority. My little children, he says. You can see, you can hear in that phrase, tenderness, my little children. You can hear his authority in that phrase. He represents himself to them as a father. And his purpose in writing, as he states it here in verse one, is audacious. I am writing these things to you, why? Here's the purpose, so that you may not sin. Now, that might not read or strike you upon first reading as audacious, but that might just be because you're rather used to the Bible and the Bible's always saying sort of crazy things and it's too easy to rationalize crazy things we read away by saying, well, it's the Bible. I probably don't understand it anyways or know all the fullness of what's going on there, but just imagine if I came here on a Sunday morning and the title of my sermon was, Beloved, Stop Sinning. And then I preached the entire sermon and it turns out it wasn't a cute little pun or a turn of phrase. The entire message of my entire sermon was you've got to stop sinning. What would you think about that? How many of you would cry? Legalism, give us grace. We don't need the law, pastor. Give us the gospel. How many of you would respond, well, okay, but you wanna maybe tell us how? Because I've been trying since I became a Christian, but not a ton of success to be honest so far. Maybe some of you would even think, well, thanks, pastor, for telling me to do the impossible. And yet that's exactly what John writes here. I'm writing to you, beloved little children, so that you may not sin, period. Why, John? Why must you and I and every believer and follower of Jesus, why must we stop sinning? Well, actually, the entire letter we call 1 John tells us why we should stop sinning. Let me give you a quick run through from the entire book to sort of fill in this tiny little slam dunk phrase of stop sinning with all that John means and has behind that. So let me just show you why you must stop sinning from 1 John, a quick little survey of the book. Sin, first of all, let me show you, jeopardizes your assurance. Sin jeopardizes your assurance. 1 John 2.3, if you wanna look over to 1 John 2.3. And by this, John writes, we know that we have come to know him, know God through Jesus, if we keep his commandments. John writes why? Because he wants you to know if you're in Jesus, he wants you to actually know that you are alive in Jesus, if indeed you are. In other words, he wants you, he's writing for your joy, for your assurance, and sin is your greatest obstacle to the blessing of assurance. And I would just say, assurance, if it's actually found and it's actually real and it's actually gifted by the Holy Spirit in this life, is one of the greatest gifts that the Holy Spirit could ever give to a believer in Jesus. To know that you're forgiven of your sins, to know that your eternity is secure, to know that Jesus has fully absorbed the wrath of God for your sins, to know that's true and not to, by the power of the Holy Spirit, not to even doubt it or question it at all, who doesn't want that gift if you're a follower of Jesus? Sin is an obstacle to your and my assurance. Sin further is anti-joy. Sin is anti-joy. Look at chapter two, verse one. My little children, I am writing to you these things, this is the verse we're studying this morning, let me read it for you one more time. My little children, I am writing to you these things so that you may not sin. Now flip back just earlier, I want you to notice a similar language in 1 John chapter one, verse four. And we are, John writes in one four, we are writing these things to you so that our joy may be complete. Do you see the similar language there? I am writing these things in chapter two, verse one, and in chapter one, verse four, it's we are writing these things. Both are purpose statements for the letter. In other words, John is telling you why he's actually putting pen to paper. He's telling you his purpose in writing. And what's his purpose? He wants you to have joy. He wants to have joy together with you and me, and he wants you to stop sinning. Now here's the point, those two things, those two purpose statements are not two separate, unrelated purposes. The darkest lie of sin is it promises you joy. Think about it. Why do you sin? Why do you bite when the lure of temptation presents itself? Because in that moment, you're convinced, because sin, temptation, is convincing you that this is the greatest possible joy I can possibly have in this moment in my life, and without it, I cannot possibly be as satisfied. If that wasn't true, you wouldn't fall for it. I wouldn't ever go for it. The darkest lie of sin is it promises you joy, and then what does it always bring? We all know because we've all fallen for the lie again and again and again, what does it bring? It brings guilt and condemnation. It never delivers on its promises. Sin is against your joy. There is great joy, on the other hand, in godliness and obedience. Obey God for your joy, not just because it's right and because he said so, obey God for your joy. Sin is anti-joy. Sin further, John writes, is lawlessness. Sin is lawlessness. Look at chapter three, verse four. Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness, for sin is lawlessness. Sin is a rejection of God's law. God's righteous, perfect standards, when we sin, are thrown away for anarchy. Sin, John further writes, is of the devil. Chapter three, verse eight. Sin is of the devil. Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil. Wow. For the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil, which are what? Sins. Jesus said to the Pharisees in John's gospel, you are of your father, the devil, who was a murderer and liar from the beginning. That's John 8, 44. When we sin, here's the point, when we sin, we act like the devil is our father because he's the father of sins. When we sin, our actions, whatever we would confess with our mouth, our actions make a statement before the world and before the heavens, we belong to, we align ourselves with Satan. Sin is of the devil. Sin is, further in 1 John, sin is evidence against you. Sin is evidence against you. Chapter one, verse six. If we say that we have fellowship with God while we walk in the darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth. 1 John chapter three, verse 10. 310, by this it is evident who are the children of God. So here's evidence, who's in, who's out. And who are the children of the devil. So who belongs to God, who belongs to the devil. Here's John's evidence. Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother. So listen, you can say that you're a Christian all you want, but if you make, if I make a habit of sinning, if we live a life characterized by sin, then John is saying, you and I give evidence that we don't actually have fellowship with God and that we aren't actually children of God. Sin is evidence against us. And finally, one more, there's even, John writes, a sin that leads to death, a sin that leads to death, by which he means spiritual, eternal, beyond the hope of forgiveness, death. Look at chapter five, verses 16 and 17. If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death, he shall ask and God will give him life. But to those who commit sins, or that is to those who commit sins that do not lead to death. But there is sin that leads to death. I do not say that one should pray for that. All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that does not lead to death. Sin, I know there's a lot there, little minefield there, sin at its core is unbelief. You boil it down to its essence, it's unbelief. That's why the unbeliever, in a very true sense, can only sin, not because he's just a terrible, wretched, horrible person who always makes every wrong choice, but he can only sin and in a sense must sin because he doesn't believe in God and he therefore never aims for God's glory, whatever good and whatever goodwill he might show or do in this earth, there's no repentance in his life. Imagine dying in a state of willful rebellion. Imagine dying in a state of unrepentant sin, sin leading unto death. So put it all together, why should you stop sinning? John says, I'm writing to you, little children, that you may not sin, stop sinning. Why should you stop sinning? Why should you not sin? Because sin, according to John, will take away your assurance, rob you of your joy, make a mockery of God's righteous law, align you with the devil, serve as evidence against you who claim to live for God and can even lead to death. All that is in the background and in the foreground when John writes to us, chapter two, verse one, that we must not sin. This is a grave warning to us all. And remember, John's writing here to churches, to professing Christians. It's a grave warning meant for us all to receive. And so let me ask you a few questions. What sin are you most engulfed in right now? Or what sin are you most tempted by right now? We should all search our hearts before God's word and answer that question. Is it a lust or anger that you've just made peace with so that now it grows larger and more powerful day by day? Because that's what sin does, sin grows. Is it laziness in the form of lacking any godly ambition or discipline to be a good steward of whatever you are and whatever God's given you and do something bold for God, live a life that counts for God? Is it checking out of your marriage, checking out of your kids, burying yourself in work or hobbies to avoid hard things at home? Is it an unchecked ambition for power or money or position or title which drives you to cut corners or act like a jerk at work? Is it some hurt that has turned into a festering bitterness so that you've lost hope in the good things of God, in the promises of God and his word and the people of God and the church? Is there a substance or a habit that you've yielded control to and become dependent upon in place of the Holy Spirit? What sin are you most engulfed in right now? What sin are you most tempted by? I have more questions. Is there any sin or sin pattern in your life that you've not confessed? In 1 John and really throughout the Bible, there's power, cleansing power and freeing power in the light. In other words, by coming clean, coming into the light, by confessing your sin. 1 John 1.9, if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. And let me say this too. Confession in the Bible, this is important. Confession in the Bible is about more than just being authentic and raw together with other people who are also being authentic and raw so that we just all put it out there and we're all honest and now we're real. Unlike the Pharisees or unlike our parents were. You confess to be honest, to be real, yes, but we confess to get help. You see, we confess to change. We confess because we're inviting a brother or a sister into our lives, into our sin, into the dark places of our heart because we actually want them to help us to turn away from that authentically raw mess that we're making inside of our hearts, which is our own sin. And so is there anybody in your life that has access to your sins? We all need that. Sin grows in darkness. It festers away from the light. One more, what is your plan for turning from sin? It's New Year's, we make plans for everything, work, finances, marriage, family, dating, whatever. Do you have a plan for your sins this year? And your game plan to conquer and grow out of your sins? I can assure you all this, your sins and the devil behind them absolutely has a plan for you. Do you have a plan by the power of the Spirit to grow and to conquer your sin? Listen to 1 John 3, 9. No one born of God makes a practice of sinning. Another one, words, no one who's actually a Christian, no one who's born of God, has the Holy Spirit residing in them, lives a life characterized by sin. For God's seed abides in him, and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God. We just sang before I came up here, you've been set free if you're in Christ. You've been born again, you have God's seed in you. You have God's Holy Spirit producing power to overcome your sin in you. So John is saying, use your freedom to stop sinning. I hope you all and we all leave this morning with fresh resolve to turn away from our sin and live our lives for the glory of God by obeying God. Stop sinning. But, I just imagine at this point the teacher, John, in the classroom, and literally everybody's got the same question, but everybody's way too ashamed to ask it. And there's that one kid, thank God for that one kid in the back who just raises his hand shamelessly and asks the question that nobody else is willing to ask after John just railed on him. Stop sinning, you have to stop sinning. And the kid raises his hand and asks, okay John, but what about when we do? Stop sinning, but what about when you do sin? That's where John turns next, and so let's think secondly about the next part, the other half, the other side of this passage. Sinning Christians must turn to Christ. Sinning Christians must turn to Christ. Look at chapter two, verse one, the second part again. But if anyone does sin, he's writing to the same people. I'm writing to you little children so that you may not sin, but if anyone does sin, you have to feel the massive tension between the two halves of verse one. I have no idea, I was thinking about this week, I have no idea why the editors put the chapter verse numbers here where they did. The words here are all inspired from the Holy Spirit of God without fault, without error, but the chapter numbers and verses were assigned much later. They're not inspired by God, right? Now, most of the time they make perfectly obvious logical sense, but here it's shocking where the verse split doesn't come, but I've also gotta say I'm kinda glad that they did leave it as is because it makes verse one even more awkward and forces you to deal with the tension. Look at verse one carefully one more time. I am writing to you so that you may not sin, same verse, but if anyone does sin. Do you see that wild awkwardness? It's really the tension of the entire letter of 1 John. It's really the tension of your entire life if you claim to follow Jesus. Sin is of the devil. It's of hell, it's darkness, it's anti-God, it hates God, it dethrones God, and no Christian can ever give themselves fully and finally to sin. And you and I sin every day. You know it, your spouse definitely knows it, John knows it. Look at chapter one verse eight. If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. John's very clear about this. Chapter one verse 10. If we say we have not sinned, we make God a liar and his word is not in us. So you must turn from sin, I must turn from sin, but you're still gonna fall into sin. And so you need to know where to turn and I need to know where to turn when we do sin. How can you still be forgiven when you do sin when you're a Christian? How can God stay happy towards you after you return to the same things that God forgave you for? How can you still find assurance for salvation when you've blown it once again for the hundredth time? That's what John is answering now. When you sin, John wants us to know if we're in Christ two things. And not just know these things, he's really inviting us to, when we sin, to turn to these things. So two things John wants us to turn to and to know when we sin. Some of you are here this morning and you feel the weight of your sin, fresh sins this week, this morning, this very service, fresh sins alive in your hearts. All of us here this morning need to feel the weight of our sins. And here's what John wants us to know. Two things, first of all, when you sin, you have an advocate. You have an advocate. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father. Jesus Christ, the righteous. The first thing you need to know and I need to know when we fall into sin yet again is that we have an advocate. The word here, advocate, is paraclete. It means one who stands beside you as an ally, even as a friend, and who pleads your case for you. The word was also used in a more technical or legal sense of actual defense lawyers. So a defense attorney in a courtroom making a plea on behalf of the accused. The paraclete is stronger than you. He has more credibility than you. You've been accused. Your name has been soiled. There may be blood on your hands, but not his. He's clean. He's got credibility, which really matters when the paraclete is for you. He's pleading your cause and taking your side. And so I want you to see we're in a courtroom here and a trial is taking place. John invites us to witness this trial with our imaginations. Now some of you probably recognize that word when I said it. Maybe you recognize it, you've heard that before, but you can't remember where. Paraclete. You've heard that before, haven't you? It's the same word that Jesus used when he promised to send the Holy Spirit to his disciples after his departure. John 14, verses 25 and 26. Jesus says to his followers, these things I have spoken to you while I am still with you, but the helper, same word, the paraclete, but the paraclete, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you. Now put those two things together. First John and what Jesus said in John's earlier gospel. Put those two things together and what do you have? Beloved, you have two paracletes. One on earth, you have two advocates. One on earth bringing heaven down to us, pleading God's cause, the Holy Spirit, pleading on behalf of God to our hearts that we might not stray or give up or forget or lose hope as we pilgrim through this life in this world with our flesh always tempted to sin. We have the Holy Spirit from heaven representing God's cause to our hearts, calling us back to God. And we have another paraclete, another advocate in heaven pleading our cause as it were in heaven before the Holy Judge that we might not fall under his condemnation or wrath. God has safeguarded you if you're a believer in Christ on this earth and God is now presently safeguarding you in heaven even and especially when you stumble into sin. We have in Christ two advocates. Isn't that good news? Glorious gospel news. Ever felt alone, abandoned, hopeless? Imagine finding yourself all alone on trial before God with no one else to speak for you. No, says John, you have an advocate before God himself, Jesus Christ the righteous. And yet more questions. Okay, we have an advocate, hope, but what's his plea? After all, we are guilty, we do stand condemned before God. What's his plea on our behalf? The second thing John wants us to know when we sin, when you sin, the second thing John wants us to turn to when you sin this afternoon, when you blow it all over again is that he, Jesus Christ the righteous, our advocate, is our propitiation. He is our propitiation. Look at verse two. He is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but for the sins also of the whole world. Now, this is the heart of this passage. This is the heart of this book of 1 John and really this is the heart of the entire Bible. In some ways, this last little bit is why I wanted to preach these two verses to begin this year before we resume our series in Genesis. But we've got to do a little bit of theology here to fully appreciate this essential doctrine of propitiation. So seatbelts on and let me show you a few very important things here. The word translated here in my Bible, I have the ESV, as propitiation can also be translated as expiation. In fact, in many translations, it is translated as expiation. In others, it's propitiation and some just avoid the tension altogether or the controversy by just translating it as something like an atoning sacrifice. So this is great. We have two options here, propitiation or expiation, and we don't know what either one means because we don't use either one of those words, do we? Over the last century, there's been a massive debate over which idea John and the other writers of Scripture, this word is used four times in the New Testament, twice in 1 John, once by Paul in Romans and another by the author of Hebrews. There's been a massive debate over the last century over what idea, which idea John has in mind when he uses this word and this debate, this divide has become a sort of fault line between widely differing theologies. And so I'm gonna tell you what these words mean and I want you to hang on here with me and we're all gonna learn something together because I wanna tell you why they matter for your life. These words are related. They're not enemies, but they're different. So expiate, expiation or expiate means to cover or to blot out. It's actually related to the word atonement. Yom Kippur, the day of atonement, that word Kippur represented a covering over the mercy seat and it's out of that word that the word expiation comes. So it's a covering or a blotting out and it's used in the Bible, expiate, with reference to sin. You expiate or God expiates sins. What does that mean? He covers them up. He absorbs them. He blots them out. He wipes them away. That's what expiate means. Propitiate, on the other hand, it's a harder idea to fully capture with another word. It means something like to placate or to satisfy or to calm down even. It's a word that the Greeks used of their gods when they were angry against them for whatever they've done and they'd offer a nice meal to their god, lowercase g, and he'd be calmed. His wrath, his anger would be cooled. In other words, he'd be propitiated. So propitiate is in a way a more personal word than expiate since expiate deals with a thing or an object, namely sin, whereas propitiate deals with a person, namely God and his wrath, his anger against sin. So you expiate or you cover sins. You propitiate or you calm down or remove God's wrath on account of sins. Are you with me? I'm gonna help you some more. When I'm home at night, most nights of the week, I often help or sometimes I entirely clean the kitchen by myself because I'm a great husband and father. And so we're a family of six and going from 11 down to 12 and down to one, and so every night, it doesn't even matter if we do take out pizza, the cleanest, safest, every night it's an absolute wreck. And so the job, if I could just walk you through it, it looks something like this. Obviously a big part of cleaning up the kitchen is dealing with the mess around the kitchen table and on the floors and there's food everywhere. And so if I could just walk you through it, it typically looks something like this. Where my wife was sitting, there's no evidence that anybody was there, like an angel came and then disappeared and we entertained them. Where numbers one and two sat and where I sat, to be honest, there's much more of a mess, but a sort of civilized, respectable mess to be cleaned up. Where number three was seated, it's immediately obvious and very apparent that much more food is on the floor or on the table than had any chance of getting inside of her body. And then there's number four, who doesn't even sit at the table, who's 14 months old and the only way I could describe what number four's surroundings look like is it looks like a sort of ground zero, like a small bomb has gone off. And so that the food has somehow become one with and melded into the wood somehow. So you've often to clean up around number one, you've gotta get down, I'm not kidding, you've gotta get down on hands and knees and actually scrub to get it out of there. Now, follow me here. Let's just say that there's a night where Nat, my wife, is out. Let's say it's women's Bible study, which begins tomorrow night, Monday night, 7.30 in the conference room, wonderful time of fellowship around the word of God. So let's say she's away one night, Monday night, Monday night, tomorrow night, 7.30 in the conference room, it's a great night out there for women's Bible study. And we had, we'd made before she left, an agreement. I, it's one night, she's away, I feed the children this night, I put them to bed and I clean the kitchen. 9 p.m., wife returns home, walks into the kitchen and it's a wreck. Pots and pans are everywhere, food is out and spoiling, the floors are unswept, ground zero's still gaseous and nuclear from number one or number four, I should say. And I'm nowhere to be found. I'm, in fact, upstairs in bed, sleeping soundly, very peacefully. This is not a true story and I need you to understand that this is legitimately not a true story, which is especially important because of what I'm about to say. So my wife is fuming and in her anger, she decides, okay, well, two can play this game, I'm gonna go to bed too. Again, not a true story and my wife is not like that. So I wake up the next morning and immediately, I'm confronted by the smells and the sights and the Holy Spirit's convicting power. I realize my sins and I clean it all up on my hands and knees, scrubbing until it's all spotless. Now, what did I just do? I want you to think about these really important, explosive even, theological terms that I just introduced to you, expiation and propitiation. What did I just do? I just expiated with cleaning spray and paper towels and washcloths and whatever it took, I expiated every last blot, blemish, stain, everything in the kitchen, on the table, on the floor. But really important question, did I propitiate? TBD. Have to wait, maybe, maybe not. Wait till I see wife for the first time. She may see the clean kitchen and that's it, wrath cooled. Wrath cooled, she may still feel betrayed, still hold a grudge, still feel anger in her hearts towards me for days, for hours, for weeks. Propitiation may take time, may require a letter apologizing, may even require flowers. Now, do you see the difference between those two ideas? This is really important. You see the difference? Expiation, propitiation, and now you can start to see why there's such a fuss over these words. Propitiation, when applied to God, makes people nervous. God can't be like that. Angry, vengeful, wrathful, expiation, no problem. Sins need covering just like food needs being wiped up, sure, but propitiation, that makes people nervous. God cannot be like that, can he? You see, you see why this is so controversial? You see why some people refuse to translate this word as propitiation? This is a terrifying thought, but it's undeniably true in the Bible. God has stored up wrath on account of our sins, and that wrath is stored up and directed towards us. Now, his wrath, this has to be said, his wrath is not like our wrath. We are capricious and random, and sometimes we're angry for all the wrong reasons. We're not angry because somebody did something wrong. We're angry because we got embarrassed, or we overreact like the punishment does not meet the crime. God is not like that at all. God's anger is never wild or unpredictable or out of control. God's wrath is his settled hostility against evil and everything in rebellion against him. God's wrath is a fitting, holy response to the Holocaust, to genocide, to abortion, to racism, to idolatry, and to selfishness, to pride, to deceit, to gossip, and to all of our sin, which always robs him of the glory that he is due. For all these things, all of our sins, wrath is stored up in God. Colossians 3, 5, and 6, put the death therefore what is earthly in you, sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, covetousness, which is idolatry. On account of these things, sins, our sins, normal sins, on account of these things, the wrath of God is coming. Ephesians 2, 3, we were all, apart from Jesus, before Jesus, we were by nature children of wrath. You know what that means? Bullseye on our backs, God's wrath aimed at us. Romans 2, 8, for those who are self-seeking, just selfish people, normal, nice, polite, selfish people, and who do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and fury. Wrath, everybody. Holy, righteous, just wrath for all our sins. Sins must be covered, and yes, righteous wrath must be placated, must be propitiated. Are you with me? And so, return with John to the courtroom. Here we stand, in all of our sins, before God Almighty, the holy judge, filled with righteous wrath, who will surely by no means allow sin to go unpunished, who will by no means pervert justice by excusing the guilty, any more than a decent judge on this earth will let a murderer go free. We stand before the holy judge. We have an accuser, oh, by the way. Revelation 12, 10, and I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of God, of our God, and the authority of his Christ have come, for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, who accuses them day and night before our God, Satan, our accuser, who knows each and every one of our sins and offenses against God better than we know them ourselves and who ever lives to bring them before God. Scripture says, reminding God of our sins. If you can believe this, Satan, in this instance, is actually pleading for justice, and he's not wrong. He deserves your wrath, God. Kill her, God. She deserves it, for once the devil is right, he's not lying. The father of lies is telling the truth here. For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, Romans 3, 23. Enter our advocate, one who pleads our case. And again, I'll ask the question, what is his plea? He doesn't appeal for leniency. After all, he is, John says, Jesus Christ the righteous. His zeal for the law of God, which we have all transgressed, is equal to the father's. He appeals to his own scarred hands, his own nail-pierced side, his own blood. His appeal is to Calvary, where at the cross, Jesus took all of our sins into his own perfect body, and he covered them, expiation. And in so doing, at the cross, Jesus fully absorbed every last ounce in his own body of the wrath of God, propitiation. He is our expiation, he is our propitiation, Jesus Christ the righteous. This was the father's design. The son, our advocate, has not outwitted the father here. The father, Romans 3, 25, says, put the son forward as our propitiation. The son pleads our cause by his own blood. The father listens, because the father, too, the holy judge of heaven, is for you. He loves you, he delights in the pardon his son has now sealed. Before the throne of God above, I have a strong and perfect plea. A great high priest, whose name is love, who ever lives and pleads for me. My name is graven on his heart. My name is written on his hands. I know that so long as in heaven he stands, no tongue can bid me thence depart. Some of you here this morning, claiming to follow Jesus, have a very casual, if I could say tolerant, attitude towards your own sin, and are maybe even unmoved by this verse, too. Jesus, our propitiation, our advocate. You already knew that, got it, yeah. Information, check. And I want to warn you, if that's you, in the spirit of John, how dangerous that is. If that persists, over time, it might even reveal that you've not actually been born of God. God's people war against their sin, though they fall often, they war against it, and God's people live for and find life and find joy in nothing else if not for in the gospel of Jesus Christ, our advocate. Some of you here this morning feel much sorrow for your sin, but you're also just so beaten down by guilt and doubt and shame, and you've been that way, honestly, your entire Christian life. You were that way before you became a Christian, and it didn't go away when you repented and believed. And I want to say to you, if that's you, you have an advocate. He is your propitiation. God delights in you. So long as that man is in heaven doing that work of pleading your cause, you are safe and you are secure. Believe his word. It really is true, and it's true for you. Some of you here this morning, lastly, young people or old aren't yet followers of Jesus. And I want to say to you that you too will stand in that courtroom before God. We all will. And right now, if you can imagine, you'll stand alone with no advocate other than yourself to plead your own cause before a God who sees all, knows all, and is filled with righteous wrath. I can't imagine anything more terrifying and anything more hopeless than that. But you don't have to. You only need to come to Jesus and believe and give him your life for him to become your advocate. You can pray with me now as we all pray together. God, we are full of sin and deserve your wrath. But you are full of mercy for sinners. And you've demonstrated your mercy and love in Jesus. The sacrifice for our sins, the absorber of your wrath, the coverer of our sins, our expiation, our propitiation. And so God, we confess once again, or maybe for the first time, that our hope and our trust is in nothing else but in Christ and in Christ alone. We believe in Jesus. We want to follow you with all of our lives. So help us, oh God, to turn away from our sins and to obey you and to live for you and to find joy and delight and satisfaction in you and to never betray you by the help of your Holy Spirit. We pray you would do all these things for our good, for our salvation, and for your glory in Jesus' name, amen.
