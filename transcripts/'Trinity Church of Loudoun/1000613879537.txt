There are two questions about God which everybody in this room has asked, is asking, or will one day ask. Number one, is God real? And number two, is God good? Those two questions, everybody in this room has asked, is asking this morning, or will be asking someday in the future. Is God real? And is God good? If you're here this morning, even if you claim to be a Christian, even if you belong to this church as a member of this church, and you're asking one or both of those questions, you don't need to hide that, like that's something scandalous to have those thoughts or to have those questions, even to have those doubts, these are questions that we all ask in one way or the other at different points in our life. Is God real? And is God good? I'm not sure there's any passage in all of the Bible which more brings into question that second question, is God good, than our passage this morning in Genesis 22. Many pastors, writers, theologians have called Genesis 22 verse 2 the most difficult verse in all the Bible. Let me read it for you. He said, that is God said to Abraham, take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you. One of, if not the most difficult verses in the Bible. Now it's not difficult to translate or to interpret or to know what it means, like head coverings in 1 Corinthians, or like the Nephilim in Genesis 6, like what in the world is he talking about? It's not at all confusing what Abraham is being told here, or what we're reading in our Bibles. It's difficult, and maybe the most difficult, in terms of how in the world do we square this with all that we claim to believe and sing about and know about God, and the God we claim to love and worship? How could a good God tell Abraham, his covenant partner and friend, to sacrifice, to kill his only son as an offering to himself, to God? How could God do it? How could God do that and still be good? Now you might be thinking, well yeah, but the end of the story, spoiler, he doesn't go through with it. He doesn't have him go through with it. Yeah, but think about it. Does that really change things that much? Imagine I told you that my kids, I decided to teach them a little lesson. And so I bought them a puppy, and I helped them to fall in love with this puppy, this cherished puppy. And then one Friday morning, I announced to my children that this Friday evening, we together we're going to pull out a blade, sorry, and sacrifice this puppy. And we're all going to watch this together. And so you're all looking at me like I'm crazy. I know, this is crazy, right? And so they weep and they mourn, they cry, why dad, why? Why must we do this? And we embrace this together, and we all cry together, and I send them off to school. And they cry, but they tough it up for the majority of the day. And then I pick them up at three o'clock, and we go to Phil & Co., and we're delaying the inevitable as long as possible. And then we get home, and the moment of truth arrives. And I gather them together into the den, and I reveal my blade. And I say, girls, here we go, watch this. And I lift the blade, and they're all weeping and crying, but they've now accepted it. No, dad, but they've accepted it. And in that moment, right as I'm about to slit the puppy's throat, girls, I'm not going to do it. It was a test, and you passed. Now, what would you think about my parenting? You'd call Child Protective Services on me. The next appointed death would be my own, and be scheduled by my wife, Natalie. And yet, that's exactly, in a way, at least analogous to what we're reading that God Almighty, the good God of the Bible, is doing here with Abraham, even if he spares his son in the end. How is that? What is he doing here? Do you see the problem? Is God good? And how could a good God tell his favored one to sacrifice on an altar to kill his one and only beloved son? I don't want to avoid that question as we work through this passage this morning. In fact, I want to answer it, and I want to show you four things in this chapter this morning, this amazing, if familiar, story. I want to show you four things, a test and a trip, a provision and a picture. Four things, if you're a note-taker, I want to show you from this story, from this familiar story, a test and a trip, a provision and a picture. So first, let me show you the test here. In verse 1, Moses tells us what we're about to witness is a test from God. He says in verse 1, the narrator says, Moses says, after these things, God tested Abraham. Now he tells us that to save us from the shock and horror of what we're about to read and what we're about to witness in the life of Abraham. This is what young people today call a trigger warning. He's telling you this at the outset so you won't freak out as you encounter Abraham and his son and a blade and fire. But he did not tell Abraham this. Abraham has no idea. This entire journey, God and Abraham together, began all the way back in chapter 12, like this. If you want to turn back to Genesis chapter 12, where this all began. Verse 1 of chapter 12 says, Now the Lord said to Abraham, go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you. That's where this all began. And the opening verses of this chapter, I want you to notice, they take us back to that beginning. 25 years later now, but these verses beginning this chapter remind us of that first scene in Genesis chapter 12. As once again, God speaks to Abraham, we read, and God said. So he speaks to him more. He tells him once more to gather all his things together. And he tells him one last time to go. Abraham has been on one long journey with God. He's settled a few times in a few different places, the Oaks of Mamre. Now he's in Beersheba. But his bags are always packed. And he's often, more often than not, really on the move in this journey with God. Chapter 12 was the beginning of his journey of faith. Indeed, chapter 22 this morning, in many ways, is the final leg of his journey with God and his final test. It's not his first test. Abraham has been tested many times by God on this journey of faith. He's been tested by famine. He's been tested by conflict and war, Genesis 14. He's been tested by infertility. Above all, he's been tested by delay after delay after delay. As for 25 years, he waited for God to give the promised child. But God has reserved his greatest and most difficult test for last. As he calls Abraham, who now has one son, a son for whom he waited 25 years. A son for whom he gave up his other son, Ishmael. A son upon whom rests all the promises of God. A son above all who he loves as a father. Do you see, do you feel how verse 2 just turns the dagger in the heart, as it were, as God says to him, take your son, twist. Your only son, Isaac, twist some more. Whom you love, twist still further. God here calls Abraham to give up his only son as a sacrifice to God. Now especially I want to say to you, if you're familiar with this story, and I trust many of you are, you need to linger on that and let that sink in, what God has just asked Abraham to do. Pagan religions contemporary to Abraham did practice child sacrifice. We know this from history. We know this from biblical history. Child sacrifice was often a thing offered to the so-called gods. Abraham given his background, he comes from a pagan background from Ur of the Chaldeans, he was probably familiar with child sacrifice. But this is really important, later in the Bible, later in the story of the Bible, later even in Moses' book, God expressly forbids this practice. There will be no child sacrifice. There will be no human sacrifice under God's rule, under God's law. It was an abomination, punishable by death, by stoning, according to God's book. You will never, let me be clear, you, I will never be called by God to sacrifice your child or any other human life for that reason. And yet, here we are. And all we're told is that it's a test. The God of the Bible is not a distant, impersonal force or idea or even just some busy, preoccupied deity demanding your worship. He's a God who speaks, who interacts with his creation and creatures, a God who calls people into a covenant relationship with himself, and a God who tests his children in order to prove and increase their faith. This is true throughout all the Bible. God tested Adam in the garden with a forbidden tree and forbidden fruit. God allowed Satan to test Job with unspeakable afflictions and sufferings. God sent Jesus, the Lord Jesus himself, immediately after his baptism. In the spirit, Jesus was sent into the wilderness, why? To be tested by Satan and tempted with everything Satan could offer. And if you enter into relationship with God by faith, then God is going to test you as well because your faith is your safe passage into salvation and into glory, and God wants that faith to prove genuine, and he even wants to stretch it and to grow it and to grow it stronger every day until glory. Think of what we saw last summer in James chapter 1. If you were here, James, our Lord's brother, begins his letter like this, Count it all joy, my brothers and sisters, when you meet trials of various kinds. For you know, we know, that the testing, the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. God means to test his followers. Do you know where you've been tested if you're a Christian, a follower of Jesus? I wonder if any of you are aware of how you're being tested right now. How are you doing with the tests that God has given you? Tests are given by God in order to expose unbelief, but also to prove faith and to stretch it and to grow it. Abraham's an old man now. An old man, even in patriarchal times, these weird long years, he's old now by any standard. An old man beaten down by the hardships of life and by the long, above all, by the long excruciating glorious journey of living in covenant with Yahweh, the one true God, who he's come to know by name. Now it's time, as an old man tested and tried as he's been, now it's time to mail it in and retire and reminisce on battles won, the victories won, even the failures he survived because of God's grace. Now it's time to settle down and coast his way into glory. Not with this God. One final test, which he must pass in order to graduate into glory, where at last his faith, which has held fast and grown with each test, will turn to sight and see its reward. A test. Secondly, I want you to notice a trip, the trip that Abraham is required to make by faith in obedience to God. Now during earlier tests, Abraham laughed, Abraham bartered, Abraham fled, Abraham feared. He did everything, but not this final test. Abraham, as far as we know, on this test, he's silent. Isn't that interesting? Think of Abraham back with Sodom and Gomorrah, how he interceded with God and begged and tried to work God down, did work God down, as he pleaded with him. What about for 10 people, God? Here he's silent. And in silence, Abraham obeys. Is he just too old and tired to fight anymore? Or has he perhaps learned to trust every bizarre-sounding syllable coming from the mouth of God? Look at verse 3. So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him and his son Isaac. And he cut the wood for the burnt offering, and he arose and he went to the place of which God had told him. Moses, you'll notice here in this chapter, he gives color where he wants to give color, he slows down the pace of the scene where he wants to slow it down, he speeds up where he wants to speed it up, and he tells us exactly the details that he wants us to ponder. Abraham here, cutting wood, what's he thinking as he's swinging the ax? We don't know. Abraham, quietly riding with his son at his side on his donkey, what's their conversation like? They talk about sports, the weather, we don't know. Because during this journey, everyone goes silent, everyone. During this long, insane, arduous, for Abraham, terrifying journey, everyone goes silent. Abraham is silent, Isaac is silent, even God stops speaking on this three-day journey. God sends him off to the land of Moriah, we read. The only other reference to Moriah in the Bible is 2 Chronicles 3, where we're told that King Solomon constructed his temple, the great and glorious temple of King Solomon was constructed, we read, 2 Chronicles 3, 1, on Mount Moriah. In other words, watch this, this is important. In other words, if this is the same Moriah, and I can't think of any reason or find any reason why we wouldn't believe it to be the same Moriah, if this is the same Moriah, then the site where Abraham is called to sacrifice Isaac is the same site where Solomon built the great temple for God, that is, Temple Mount in Jerusalem. Jerusalem was about a 45-mile journey from Abraham's tents in Beersheba, where he currently resides, which indeed would be, by donkey and by foot, about a three-day journey. And so we pick up in verse 4, on the third day, Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar. And then Abraham said to his young men, stay here with the donkey, I and the boy will go over there and worship and come again back to you. And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on his son Isaac, and he took in his hand the fire and the knife. And so they went, both of them, together. So three days later, arriving to the mountains of Moriah, Abraham leaves the servants and the donkeys behind. His parting words to his servants are cryptic. He says, we are going over there to worship, and then we're going to come back to you. He and the boy, he says, are going to offer sacrifices to God to worship, and then they together shall return. Both of them shall return. What's going on here? Is Abraham in denial? Is he hiding the unspeakable truth from his servants and obviously from his son Isaac? Or has Abraham worked out in his own head and heart that surely God is going to do something here? He doesn't know what, maybe, but God is going to do something here. In fact, Hebrews chapter 11 tells us, gives us some insight into maybe what was going on inside Abraham's mind here. When we read in Hebrews 11, 19, he, Abraham, considered that God was able even to raise Isaac from the dead, from which, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back. Apparently, Abraham is going through with this because he's banking on resurrection, which at this point in the Bible, if I could just point out, that's unheard of. We know nothing of resurrection at this point in the Bible. Abraham, per the author of Hebrews, is banking on, he's going to go, he's going to kill his son and he's praying, he's banking on God will raise him from the dead. And so Abraham and Isaac head off alone, father and son, for the final leg of their journey. Isaac carrying the wood, Abraham carrying the weapons. And it's at this moment in this stunning narrative that the silence is broken, not by the father, Abraham, but by the son. Look at verse seven in Isaac. We read, said to his father, Abraham, my father. And Abraham said, here I am, my son. And he said, Isaac said, behold the fire and the wood. But where's the lamb for the burnt offering? You can cut the tension here with a knife, no pun intended. We don't know how old Isaac is here in this story. Boy in verse five is ambiguous. It could refer to a young boy, five or six. It could refer to a young man as old as 20s or even in his 30s. All we know is that Isaac here carries the wood. This is not a son honoring his father or a father demanding his son's respect. This is a son stronger than his father, who is an old man here. So he's probably at least a young, strapping, growing, strong boy. And whatever his age, he works out in his mind a problem as dad leads him up the mountain. Dad, where's the lamb? He knows how this works. He's seen his dad in action before, worshiping before. He knows exactly what this requires. Dad, where's the lamb? Abraham in this moment is caught. Maybe he just hoped in this moment that Isaac wouldn't notice or ask. Have you ever been in those situations? I find myself, I think in parenting, in these situations all the time where you're just hoping to God your kids won't notice something and they won't ask a question that's really difficult to answer that you don't want to answer. Is Abraham here, surely? But Isaac's caught him and so he asked him and Abraham's answer reflects not only his wisdom but his faith. Look at verse 8, Abraham said, here's his answer, God will provide for himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son. God will provide. What is he saying here? He's throwing it all back on God. Dad, where's the lamb? Abraham, God will provide. Abraham, God, you're going to provide. You have to provide, God. He's throwing it all in faith back on God. He has no other recourse. And so they scale the mountain together, probably steep enough that the donkeys couldn't make the journey. That's why they left him behind. They arrive to the place where God had told them to arrive. There Abraham builds the altar and remarkably Moses reports. He skips some details but he reports that Isaac is bound to the altar. The boy is bound to the altar. Did Abraham tell him? Did Abraham in his old age somehow wrestle him to the altar and tie his hands behind his back and bind his body? Did he somehow trick him? We don't know. We're not told. Most likely I think he must have told Isaac. I don't think he could contain the boy at this point. He must have told Isaac and Isaac must have agreed, perhaps in a faith matching his father's. Now I just want to say here and I want to ask your forgiveness in advance for gory details. So that we're all on the same page and understand what's happening here. To make a sacrifice, the priest had to contain the animal and then slit its throat and then dismember the animal and then bind all of the dismembered parts together and then offer it up as a sacrifice to God. It was a gruesome affair, a bloody affair of which Abraham was no stranger. Abraham here ties his son, his only son, whom he loves, to the altar and then father Abraham takes out his knife and then father Abraham raised his knife. And if I could right here, awkwardly press pause on the movie so I can make a few comments. I do this sometimes with Nat, drives her nuts, Netflix or something like that. Just pause right here. I got something I want to say. Abraham is a man of faith, living by the words, he lives his life by the words of God. And God has told him two things, two irreconcilable things. And I want you to feel how irreconcilable these two things are. First of all, God has told him, God has promised him that his son, the son of the promise, will become a nation of peoples. So he didn't just promise Abraham a son, Isaac. He's got the son. No, that's not the end of the story. He promised Abraham that his son, Isaac, would become a nation of peoples. From him would come nations and those nations would be blessed in his son through Isaac. He's promised Abraham that. But secondly, God has now commanded Abraham to kill this same son as a sacrifice. Do you, you have to see and you have to feel that contradiction. Do you see it? Do you feel it? One son I will give to you, Abraham, and through him shall come a nation of peoples who will restore my blessing, my salvation to all the earth. That one son, that same son, Abraham, now take his life. Do you feel how irreconcilable those two things are? Do you feel the gap between those two things? He must have, Abraham must have been doing the math in his head every day since he had heard this word from God. And it's just impossible. He's figured out to reconcile these two things. Have you ever felt that gap in your own life? God's word has promised this, but it seems like God is doing this. Or very similarly, God's word tells me this, commands this, promises this, but this is my reality. Do you know that gap in your own life? It's often a massive gap between what God's word says and what I experience, what I see. Listen to me. It's there in that gap that faith lives and is awakened and is stretched and grows and shows itself and proves itself to be real. And it's there in that gap that God means and designs to test you and me and our faith and stretch our faith and grow our faith. And it's the same for Abraham. That gap matters immensely for your journey to glory with God by faith. It feels like a contradiction, that gap. It felt like a contradiction to Abraham, but it's not a contradiction. Tension is maybe getting us closer, but that's still not quite right. Probably the best way to think about that gap, the best word, the best I can come up with is mystery. Right now, think about it. Jesus, God's word tells me, it promises me. Jesus is reigning above and over and in all things. He's ruling, He's reigning. He's in charge right now. And yet what do we see? Just turn on the news, walk outside, chaos. God's word right now tells me that Jesus is building His church and that the gates of Hades shall not overcome it. He's building it in all nations for all peoples. Every tribe, tongue, and nation shall bow before Jesus. Jesus is building that. Satan cannot do anything about it. And yet the church in the West, the United States, is pretty rapidly declining. And the church abroad is often so minuscule, it's underground. It's persecuted, it's dominated by authorities. Do you see the gap I'm talking about? You know this gap if you're a believer in Jesus, if you take His word seriously. There are gaps. How about personally? He has told you, oh man or oh woman, what is good and what is right and what is pure. And yet I want what I want and I crave what I crave. And sometimes it feels like I can't do anything about it. We all know these gaps. Those gaps are often massive. There are gaps everywhere, but faith lives in those gaps. And faith obeys. Whatever is seen or felt or not seen or felt, faith obeys, just like Abraham here. Abraham does not know how this story ends. God has been silent to Abraham. On this final leg of Abraham's greatest test, God is not speaking to Abraham. And yet for decades now, God has proven Himself faithful to Abraham and good to Abraham. And so even in the mystery, even in this massive gap, Abraham believes. And so he obeys. And so he pulls the blade. And so he prepares the blow. And only in that moment and in that instant is the silence in our story broken. So thirdly, let me show you a provision. A provision. Look at verse 11. But the angel of the Lord called to him from heaven and said, Abraham, Abraham. And he said, here I am. You bet he said, here I am. Here I am, God. And God said, the angel of the Lord said, do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him. For now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son from me. I just can't imagine there's ever in the history of the world been a noise more welcomed in silence than this noise. Abraham, any noise, anything from anybody. Somebody speak. Somebody say something. And a voice comes and it's a voice he recognizes. It's a voice from heaven. A voice Abraham knows. It's the angel of the Lord. Maybe, many think, the voice of Christ Jesus himself breaking the silence here, stopping Abraham just in the nick of time. God, mind you, notice, God is nothing like those other so-called gods, those pagan gods. He would never require or permit the sacrifice of children. Don't miss that. That's tertiary to the point of the story. But that's very much clear here. God would never. God is not like that. This is the 35th time God speaks to Abraham in the stories of Genesis, audibly. It's also the last. The voice affirms Abraham's faith. Now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son from me. Here, notice, here is faith in action. Here's what faith looks like. It looks like fearing God, fearing God, the worshiper, obeys all God says and gives all up to God that he asks. That's worship. The fear of the Lord, that's faith. James says, speaking of this moment where Abraham raises the knife, James says that Abraham's faith here was proven by his works. James 2.22. Here is faith, James is saying. Here is faith, Moses is saying. Do you see what faith looks like? Verse 13, and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked. And behold, behind him was a ram caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up. It's so fast here, just like that. All the agony, the three days, as soon as he saw that ram, it's on the altar. He offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son. And so Abraham called the name of that place, Jehovah-Jireh. The Lord will provide. As it is said to this day, on the mount of the Lord it shall be provided. In a section of the Bible where God is seemingly given a new name every other page, every other paragraph, Abraham here adds to the list. As he, for the first time, speaks on the pages of scripture, Jehovah-Jireh. God will provide. Could also be translated as God sees. Either way, the idea is not that different. What's being said here is getting at the same idea. God sees you. God sees you and he'll come through for you. He'll provide for you because he sees you. The voice from heaven speaks again in verses 15 through 18, sealing the promise. Sealing these old promises, 25-year-old promises, at least one final time. People, place, blessing. Abraham's faith is met by God's grace here. And Isaac lives. Now listen, God is never going to ask you to offer your child or any loved one as a sacrifice to him. I've said it before, I'm going to say it again. But he certainly is going to test you and test your faith. I've said that before, I'm saying that again. Some of you know this. Some of you have heard this because you've been in the church or read the Bible for a while. You know that God tests those he loves. And some of you, some of us, will do anything to avoid these tests. And honestly, I get it. Prayers like this, God, grow my faith. Whatever you have to do, grow my faith. Prove it genuine. Shave away the dross, God. In Jesus' name, amen. These are the prayers that we avoid praying or we pray half-heartedly and wince as we say amen, aren't they? Wondering what we've just asked God to do. Invited God to do. But let me ask you this. Abraham, surely Abraham would have chosen to avoid this test, this final test. Who wouldn't have? Who would sign up for this? Nobody. Certainly not Abraham. But when it was over, let me ask you this. When it was over and Abraham woke up the next morning on the other side of this test, after the journey, after the wood, after the fire, after the binding, after you raised the knife, after all the anxious agony, do you think, let me ask you, do you think Abraham would have it any other way? He's proven once more beyond any shadow of a doubt that God is faithful. God will provide. God will always come through, even at the very last second. And he's proven that God really is good. So good. God provides. Which brings us, fourthly and finally, and perhaps most importantly, to a picture. I want to show you the picture that this chapter of the Bible, this amazing scene, gives for us as readers. So why did God do it? That's the question you've got. If you're not wrestling with that question with all due respect, I just don't think you're appreciating how insane this chapter is. Why did God do it? He came through at the end. He provided at the end. But why did he do it? Why the mind tricks? Why the seeming mental torture? It's a complicated question. I'm honestly not sure how a Jewish person would answer it. But I know how the Bible answers it. And I know especially how the New Testament answers it. And I know that by the end of the Bible, it's really clear why God did it. And I want to tell you about that now. You see, there's no clearer picture in Genesis, maybe the entire Old Testament. There's no clearer picture of where this entire story was all going and what this entire story is all about than here in Genesis chapter 22. You see, it's a story about salvation. It's a story about blessing. It's a story about a blessing lost in a garden and a blessing being restored to all the nations, to all the peoples through Abraham and through his offering and through the nation that's going to come from Abraham and through Isaac. It's a story about blessing. It's a story about salvation. But it's a story, you see, about a salvation that only comes through sacrifice and through blood. On Mount Moriah, Abraham was prepared to sacrifice Isaac, his one and only son, until God showed up and provided a ram in the thicket. On the same mountain, generations later, a king named Solomon built a temple. And in that temple, sacrifices were offered always throughout the year. Every year, sacrifices were offered. Oxen, sheep, rams, blood, everywhere. To God for sins. And on that same mountain, still generations later, God gave his son, his one and only beloved son, as the final and perfect sacrifice for the sins of the world. Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. Jesus' cousin cried upon first seeing him in the wilderness. Like Isaac, Jesus journeyed up the mountain in the region of Moriah called Calvary. And he did it. He made the journey carrying his own wood on his own back. His own cross. This time, there was no other ram hidden in the thicket at the end of the journey. He was the Lamb. He was God's provision. Jehovah Jireh. His father raised the knife, as it were, the awful cup of God's wrath for the sins of all the people. And this time, no voice stopped him. Only Jesus' voice could be heard upon Mount Calvary. The beloved son crying out to his father, my God, my God, why have you forsaken me? And the knife fell. And the cup of wrath was empty. And the Lamb was slain. Do you see? Why did he do it? Do you see why he did it? God painted the picture for Abraham, for Isaac, and for you of Jesus, the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. For three days he lay in the grave before the father spoke and the son came back to life. And just like Isaac got up from his would-be tomb, Jesus got up and defeated death forever. That's why he did it. Tim Keller passed into glory on Friday. I thought I'd honor him and his ministry by quoting from him at length as I close. The God of the Bible is most radically different from the primitive gods of old in this way. The ancients understood the idea of the wrath of God. They understood the idea of justice. They understood the idea of a debt and a necessary punishment. But they had no idea that God would come and pay it himself. The cross is the self-substitution of God, and this is love. God created the world in an instant, and it was a beautiful process. He recreated the world on the cross, and it was a horrible process. That's how it works. Love that really changes things and redeems things is always a substitutionary sacrifice. One more, Keller. Jesus is the true and better Isaac, who was not just offered up by his father on the mount, but was truly sacrificed by his father for us. Why did God ask Abraham to sacrifice Isaac? Not because he's some sick, sadistic deity torturing his subjects into submission just to make a point. He did it because he really is this good and because he and he alone loves and loves like that, and he wanted you and me to know it. He provided the lamb. He will always provide the lamb. His name is Jesus. He wanted you to know Jesus and what real love is like and what it's all about, and it's about sacrifice and it's about substitution. I want to know Jesus more than anything else, and I want you to know him too, and I want you to give your life to him if you haven't yet. I know some of you here today still haven't yet given your life to Christ by faith. You're unsure if he's worth it. You're unsure if he's good enough. Behold the awesome love of God on display in Isaac and Abraham. Love above all loves. You'll find no better love. Or if you already know him, to keep on trusting him and journeying with him by faith. Whatever trials may come, however he might test you, he is good. He will always provide. Jehovah Jireh. God, thank you for stirring shocking, surprising pictures which help us to see Jesus. Thank you that you provide for us. You provide for us bread and water. You provide for us friends and family and fellowship. You provide for us, above all, rescue and salvation in Christ and the hope of glory. God, we pray that you would increase and stretch our faith as we don't go through what Abraham went through exactly, but as we behold your provision for him and all that's meant for us in this. God, we pray that you would increase and grow our faith or give faith for the first time by your Holy Spirit. We pray all these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
