What does Ruth have to do with Christmas? We've been looking at this story, this really amazing story over the last four weeks. It's a story of two widows, and it's a story of poverty and famine and helplessness and hopelessness. It's a story of a Moabite and a bunch of the people of God in Bethlehem. It's a story of redemption and of a kinsman redeemer, and it's a story of God taking what was empty and who was empty and filling them back up. But what does it all have to do with Christmas? It's one of the greatest stories ever written. Actually, there's a legend. One of you told me that, I cannot remember who, but somebody this week, I think it was one of you, you can identify yourself after the service, told me that the legend, which I looked up on the internet this afternoon to confirm, there's a legend that Benjamin Franklin, during his diplomatic travels to Paris and France, he would often enter into these circles of philosophers called the infidels. And they called themselves the infidels because they enjoyed gathering together and mocking Christianity and the Bible as they entered into enlightened learning via art and literature and great works of literature. And so there's a legend, which evidently is true that when you're on one such excursion to France, Benjamin Franklin entered into this group and he said, I'd like to tell you a story. It's an ancient story, and he told them this remarkable story of widows and of famine and of redemption and of an impossible thing happening, of strangers and foreigners coming in as outsiders and then being accepted as insiders. And the people were gushing and enraptured and begged him to tell them where the story came from. And he finally revealed that he just changed the names and the places, and he was telling the book of Ruth. It's a remarkable, it really is an amazing story, but what does Ruth have to do with Christmas? Actually, we didn't finish the story this morning. It ends with a genealogy, which I haven't yet touched. It's the only book in the Bible, actually, the entire Bible, that ends with a genealogy. And so this evening, this Christmas Eve, I'm going to preach the genealogy of Ruth as my Christmas present to you. I didn't get any of you anything except my wife and children, and this is my present to you all. And then we're finished with the book of Ruth. So here's the genealogy which concludes the book of Ruth. Boaz and Ruth have just been married. They've just had a child named Obed. It's sitting in Naomi's lap and she's been filled. And then we read this. Now these are the generations of Perez. Perez fathered Hezron. Hezron fathered Ram. Ram fathered Aminadab. Aminadab fathered Nashon. Nashon fathered Salmon. Salmon fathered Boaz. Boaz fathered Obed. Obed fathered Jesse. And Jesse fathered David. This is the word of the Lord. I know they're just names, but if you know the names and you know even some of the stories, it really is a bizarre genealogy. Perez is the offspring of Judah and Tamar, whose story has come up a few times during Ruth. It's one of the most scandalous stories in the Bible. Judah, father-in-law. Tamar, daughter-in-law, did her wrong. So she tricked him and cheated him, dressing up as a prostitute. And the offspring of that scandalous get-together is Perez. Salmon is the husband of, does anybody know? Rahab. Yeah, that Rahab. That Canaanite, Gentile prostitute who helped the Israelites in their conquest of Jericho. So Boaz was either Rahab's son or his grandson or her grandson. Genealogies in the Bible sometimes skips generations just to emphasize key people. But Boaz comes from Rahab. And then of course there's Boaz, the kinsman redeemer who we've met, who married Ruth, the Moabite, who herself is a daughter of Lot. And Lot's incestuous relationship with his daughter. They named their son Obed. And Obed fathered Jesse and Jesse fathered David. King David. That David. You've got to remember what Ruth is, when Ruth is, where Ruth is, and where we all began to make sense of this. Ruth takes place, remember, in the days of the judges. The days when everybody did what was right in their own eyes. The days when women were cheaply assaulted and that nobody was ever held to account for it. The days when Israel had no king. In your Bible, I mentioned this, in our English Bibles, Ruth sits between the book of Judges and the books of first and second kings. In Judges there's no king and so everybody does what is right in their own eyes. By the time we get to first kings and second kings, there are kings. And the kingdom in first and second kings reached its pinnacle under King David. The man after God's own heart. The king who ruled in righteousness. And so think about it, the book of Ruth ends with David. Do you see? Ruth reads like a movie director. In the dark days of the judges, who pans the camera and zooms in on one little somewhat random town of Bethlehem. And two random nobody widows. One of them an Israelite, the other one a Moabite. But the book ends with the movie director then having now fully immersed you into that story. Invested you into that story. Yes, Ruth got Boaz and yes, they had a kid. Now he zooms the camera back out, pans it back out to all of Israel in the days of Judges and to David. The story of Ruth and Naomi, two widows in the little town of Bethlehem, turns out is part of a way larger story. Ruth, in a way in other words, is really a story about Israel. Israel having fallen into utter ruin and decay and on the brink of being wiped out by God for their sins. The last verse of the Judges, remember, in those days there was no king in Israel and so therefore everybody did what was right in their own eyes. But then God does something. He does a new work, a new baby, a new line, a new king. The last verse of Ruth, Obed fathered Jesse and Jesse fathered David. King David, who will soon restore Israel to glory. And even if just for a moment, rule righteously before God and bring the people back to God. It is no exaggeration to say, think about it, the point of the book of Ruth is the final verse and Jesse fathered David. The last word in the book of Ruth is David. At the same time, Ruth is just a story about two widows in the little town of Bethlehem trying to survive bitter and empty until through a remarkable series of providences they're redeemed and there's marriage and there's a son and they're both filled again by God's grace. So which is it? Is it a story about an old widow and her sadness, her bitterness, her anger at God, Naomi? Or is it a story, the story about Israel's kingdom and how God finally gave them a king? Sort of like our lives, isn't it? We belong, if you're a Christian, we belong to this grand story of redemption, which began far before you and will end long after you and wrap you up into this glorious, massive story. We participate as a church in the life of Jesus, in his victory march, our existence, even this moment testifies to his reign, our spiritual lives together. Every time somebody freshly believes in Jesus, repents from their sins and trusts in Jesus for the first time, every time we worship together as the people of God restored to his likeness by faith in Christ, every single time we do that, it is God's resurrection power breaking into this earth, into the decay and death of this fallen world. This is our story and yet at the same time our lives are just our lives filled with failures, more often than failures, just boring, our boring little lives. Our church is just our church. We're not making any front line, front page news in the Washington Post. We're not even in the Loudon times. People regularly visit here and will sometimes remark, I had no idea this was a church. It just says Trinity. Why? Because Trinity is way more affordable than printing Church of Loudon on that brick out front. It's all, you know, it's all so ordinary and so unremarkable and also unnoticed by the world, just like Ruth. And yet God was shaping history, birthing kings, authoring redemption in the random story of the book of Ruth. One final observation and then I'm done. The genealogy of Ruth, the one I just read for you, is reproduced later in the Bible. It's basically copied and pasted into the beginning of the book of Matthew. Matthew chapter one, let me read for you. This is just one little section of the long genealogy that Matthew's gospel, the first book of the New Testament, begins with. Matthew 1.3, in Judah, the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar. And Perez, the father of Hezron. And Hezron, the father of Ram. And Ram, the father of Amenadab. And Amenadab, the father of Nashon. And Nashon, the father of Salmon. And Salmon, the father of Boaz by Rahab. And Boaz, the father of Obed by Ruth. And Obed, the father of Jesse. And Jesse, the father of David the king. Sound familiar? Added in a few extra details, but it's the same exact genealogy reproduced. It's the same scandalous names. The next verse in the genealogy of Matthew actually includes David's child by the wife of Uriah by Bathsheba. Remember that story and that affair? This longer genealogy, which I've just read from, of course, is the book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham, Matthew 1.1. It is, in other words, the line of the Messiah, David's true heir, the king of kings and lord of lords, and the one savior of the world. Think about it. When we have something scandalous or embarrassing in our families, in our family lines, what do we do? Y'all can act holy, but me and Frank are hiding it. Just like Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia hid Harry. Just like Rosemary Kennedy, JFK and RFK's sister, who nobody knew existed until the parents couldn't hide it anymore. Just like Elizabeth Ann, the secret love child of Warren G. Harding, the 29th president of the United States. Scandal, bury, deny, repeat. This is the genealogy of the Messiah, and he doesn't hide or delete a single one of those shady names. And oh my gosh, are they shady. It's an absolutely wild line of family members producing Jesus the Christ. You thought it would be clean, but it runs through prostitutes like Rahab. You thought it would be pretty, but it dabbles right into scandals, awful scandals like Judah and Tamar. You thought it would be pure, but it jumps over outside of Israel and to despise Gentiles, even Moabites like Ruth. These are the grandmothers of Jesus. If the Messianic line was a piece of art, it'd be a collage. Remember, seventh grade kids, you can help us parents afterwards explaining collage. It'd be a collage of all these different artifacts and stories and people who don't really belong together, who almost don't even make any sense together. The longer you stare at them, who even become, the closer you get offensive and repulsive, the more you look. They're filthy. They look horrendous. They even have smells to them until you realize that together, all these disparate, despicable pieces form the silhouette of the Messiah as God writes his story in the way that only God could see it and in the way that only God would write it. And my friends, I wonder if you know what that means for you here this evening. It means God is not afraid to associate with the lowly or with the offensive. It means Jesus is not afraid to call you brother and sister. If you take him as king by faith, he'll take you, own you as son and daughter blessed eternally forever. Many things keep people from trusting in Christ as savior. One of them, one of the main things that keep people from Jesus, one of the devil's oldest lies is people feeling unworthy. Oh God, yeah, I hear you. That's great for you. He could not possibly forgive me. If you knew anything about me, you would understand why. Oh, but do you see this thing is trustworthy and this thing is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance. Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom I am the four, the foremost first Timothy one 15 sinners. He came from sinners for crying out loud and he came to save sinners just like me, just like you for redeemers. I said this morning in Ruth chapter four, Piloni Elmoni, the failed redeemer, Boaz, the worthy redeemer, Obed, the child redeemer of Naomi, David, the king redeemer, who himself served as the greatest picture in all the old Testament and all the Bible of the greatest redeemer, the Lord Jesus Christ. Bethlehem, historians tell us, was home to some 2,000 residents when Jesus was born. So when we sing, Oh little town of Bethlehem, that is not metaphorical. It was a tiny little town, Bethlehem, 2,000 people. And God chose Bethlehem of all places to be the city of kings. Ruth and Boaz, King David, King Jesus. God is not put off or afraid of small things, weak things, despised things, any things who will just take his son for the savior that he is. Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie, above thy deep and dreamless sleep, the silent stars go by, yet in thy dark streets shineth the everlasting light, the hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight. God, thank you for Christ, the King and the redeemer. God, we pray that you would produce wonder in our hearts before Christ, the God who became man. And we pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.
