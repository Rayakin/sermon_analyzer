A marathon is 26.2 miles. I've never run one. By God's grace, I never will. But 26.2 miles, 26 miles and then 385 yards, and those .2, that final .2, those 385 yards are critical. They really matter. And Young Light, Young Life, just prayed for Young Life, YouTube, YouTube has the footage to prove it. Last night I watched a handful of videos of marathoners in big races, Boston, New York, collapsing in the final few yards of the race. Absolutely brutal. Some of them heroic. One woman and another man, separate videos, just going along, setting personal records. Totally collapsed and then got on hands and knees because they couldn't get back up and crawled across the finish line. Just absolutely heroic. You want to cry and you don't even know the people and you don't know why you want to cry, but you want to cry at their heroism. Others just agonizing. One woman was blazing, leading, winning a race, 26 miles and 26.15 miles and got to the actual, you know the finish line has the big structure and she got to the actual, she was on the platform before she crossed the tape. When she collapsed, tried to get up, collapsed again and could not move, her body entirely broke down. She had to send medics to come and take her away in an ambulance. Poor woman, absolutely brutal. Body just entirely shut down. This morning we continue our journeys with Abraham. In Genesis chapter 20, if you're not there, I invite you to turn in your Bible to Genesis 20. If you don't have a Bible, we have several copies right on the other side of those double doors on the inside. We invite you to grab one of those. You can go grab one now. You can take one. If you don't have a Bible, take it and keep it and read it. It's our gift to you. Genesis chapter 20 now, for 25 years, Abraham's been following God and we've been following Abraham as he's trying to follow God. And for 25 years, waiting on God's promises. Now it's been quite a while, but a little bit of a refresher. We looked at three big promises that God put before Abraham beginning in chapter 12. Can you remember them? Some of you, some of you, some of you. Some of you are going to make it to the end. People, place, and blessing. These are the three big promises that God has begun making and repeating to Abraham beginning in Genesis chapter 12. People, that is a nation of descendants shall come through Abraham, place, God's going to give to Abraham a sojourner. He's going to give him a land to dwell in, the promised land, and blessing. Abraham's going to be blessed by God. He's going to be saved. But even more than that, Abraham has been told by God that he's going to be the vehicle of God's blessing for all the nations. So people, place, blessing. And what we've really been waiting for, for chapters and years, decades now, is God specifically told Abraham that that people is going to begin with a son. But that son's not here. Abraham's 99 years old, and after 25 years of waiting, God has just told him that the last chapter, two chapters ago, this time next year, the son is finally going to arrive. Sarah, his wife, is going to have the child. He's months away from the finish line now in Genesis chapter 20, and months away from the finish line, Abraham falls down, collapses, and returns to old, familiar sins, and throws everything into jeopardy once again. And so that's what we're going to see this morning. We're going to look at this passage, this chapter, in three different scenes. So if you're a note taker, there are three different things I want to show you, three different movements in this passage. First of all, a dangerous deception, a dangerous deception, we'll look at verses one and two for that. Secondly, consecutive confrontations, twice we're going to witness a confrontation, a significant confrontation, which changes the story. So consecutive confrontations, we'll look at verses three through 13 for that. And finally, third, glorious grace, verses 14 through 18, glorious grace, three scenes this morning, Abraham falls down, God rescues, beginning with, first, dangerous deception. The oaks of Mamre have been Abraham's home for a good while now, and they've been a good home to Abraham. Here he's met with God, God has come to him here before, beneath the oaks of Mamre, as Abraham pitched his tent there and then became Abraham, he's dined with God, he's argued with God, he's pleaded with God, he's prayed with God, God has heard him, he's entered into covenant with God here beneath the oaks of Mamre, he's become God's friend. He of all the people on the earth, he and his wife are the friends of God. All of that has happened beneath the oaks of Mamre, where Abraham has called home for a long time now, but in chapter 20, verse one, if you look there now, Abraham picks up all of his things and heads south to Gerar. This is Philistine territory, it doesn't say that in this passage, but this is what the rest of the Bible will tell us is the Philistines, this is where they live, but it's also part of the land promised to Abraham, it's part of the promised land. Now we're not told why he left, maybe he, like Lot, wanted to get as far away from the valley of horrors where Abraham perched up beneath the oaks of Mamre, had witnessed all the awful fire and sulfur and brimstone unleashed upon Sodom and Gomorrah and all the cities of the valley as God's wrath was poured out on them, maybe Abraham, like Lot, just wanted to get as far away as he possibly could. We're not told why he left, all we're told, verse one, is that Abraham sojourned. There he pilgrimed, he became a pilgrim, Lot, think about Lot, what did Lot do? Lot lingered, even when he was warned, even when he was being rescued, even when he saw the lightning and fire coming from the sky, Lot's still looking back, Lot's still trying to negotiate with the rescuing angels for something else like these cities which he called home, Lot lingered, Abraham sojourned. Abraham, wherever he went, his suitcase was always packed. Abraham was one of those men of faith that the author of Hebrews speaks of when he writes, of whom the world was not worthy, men of whom the world was not worthy, wandering about in deserts and mountains and dens and caves of the earth, Hebrews 11, 38. Abraham was one of those men like Peter urges you and me and all of us as the church to be sojourners and exiles, beloved I urge you, Peter writes, as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh which wage war against your soul, that's 1 Peter 2, verse 11. We're to learn from Abraham here, even as we watch him in passing and without comment and just moving on, we must not make this world into our home. Unlike Lot, Abraham has not made his setting, even his amazing place of meeting with God into a home. He is fundamentally a sojourner and so entering into a new country, Abraham returns to some old habits and really old sins. Look at verse 2, and Abraham said of Sarah, his wife, she's my sister and Abimelech, the king of Gerar, Abimelech means my father is king, so you meet multiple Abimelechs in the Bible, different characters, it's probably not his actual name, it's probably a title. Abimelech, king of Gerar, sent to Abraham and took Sarah. Now in case you missed it, back in chapter 12, Abraham pulled this exact same move to protect himself a different time while sojourning in Egypt to escape a famine in the promised land. Remember back in chapter 12, he did the same thing and he barely made it alive that time to say nothing of the danger, the horrible danger he put his wife in. Here, in a new land and before a new king, he reverts back to his old bag of tricks and pulls the same stunt again. In fact, we learn in verse 13, if you look down in verse 13, that this plan of Abraham reaches back even further than Egypt in chapter 12. Look at verse 13, and when God calls me, Abraham, this is his defense to Abimelech, when God calls me to wander from my father's house, I said to Sarah, my wife, this is the kindness you must do to me. At every place to which we come, say of me, he is my brother. We just found out critical background information, didn't we? God called Abraham to leave his home, Ur of the Chaldees, when he was 75 years old. He obeyed, he exercised faith and he obeyed, but he was scared. And so he hedged his bets by hatching a plan and got his wife, his notoriously beautiful wife, even as she entered old age, got his wife to agree to play the part of his sister so that he could give her away to powerful strangers and protect his own neck. He's had this plan in the works, in the pocket for at least 25 years now, but he hasn't done it for years and years as far as we know, and now in fear, he falls back to his own ways. It's very sad, very tragic, and there's a word for this. There's a word for what we're witnessing here, which our generation of Christians in the church has by and large lost, but which generations before us used all the time, and I think we would do well to recover, and the word here for what we're witnessing is backsliding. Abraham here is backsliding. Now what is backsliding? Many of you have never heard of that before. What is backsliding? Let me read for you a definition from a pastor and theologian named Joel Beeky defining what is backsliding. This is a quote, a few sentences, but listen carefully. This is critical. Backsliding is a season in the life of a professing Christian when his or her sin grows stronger and his or her obedience declines. I'm still reading a quote. Not all sin is backsliding. Every time you sin, you're not backsliding. The Christian life is a constant cycle of sin and repentance and sin and repentance and sin and more repentance all under the atoning blood of Jesus, amen? But sometimes the cycle of repentance is broken for a while. The sin keeps on going, but the repentance stops for a while. That is backsliding. Listen to this, the final sentence in this quote, and I want you to hear this and I want you to feel the chills that ought to go up your spines if you claim to be a follower of Jesus. It could lead to outright apostasy, that is rejecting walking away from Jesus in the gospel. It could lead to outright apostasy or simply from falling away from Christ. Backsliding is an experience common to many Christians and some never recover from it. It doesn't mean they lost their salvation, it means they proved, as many characters in the New Testament proved, that they never really were saved even though they professed to follow Jesus. Now listen, we all have besetting sins. Sins that we're, for whatever reason, we're particularly vulnerable to these sins. Maybe not these other sins, maybe not your sins, but my sins. I'm vulnerable to these. These are things I particularly struggle with or have struggled with. I have a history with this sin or these sins. We all have besetting sins. Abraham's, at least one of them, is what? It's deceit. And I want you to see, this is critical, it's his fear, his fear that drives him back to this old sin, which he hasn't, as far as we are aware, engaged in for years and even perhaps decades. It's his fear that drives him there. That's a really important observation, I think, to make from this story. He hasn't done this for a long time, but the second he becomes afraid, he turns right back to what's comfortable. He turns right back to old, dirty, familiar sins, which make him to feel safe. I think that's a significant connection for us to consider. Fear often drives us to other sins. Backsliding, if I could, I could read a little bit more from the same author. Backsliding, quote, need not involve any big or scandalous sins. We're not just talking about adultery or murder here. It often begins with coldness in prayer. And a sense of indifference towards the word of God. And inner corruption begins to grow like a rotten potato spreading decay to other potatoes in the bag around it. A sour attitude replaces joy. Hypocrisy and pride rise up in our hearts. We become impatient, discontent and quick to anger towards other people. And though we profess to be Christians, we find ourselves more and more drawn, drawn like a magnet to the world, end quote. People backslide for many different reasons. Overwhelming temptations from the world, just being bombarded and finally giving in. Unrepentant sin. Sometimes, this happens all the time, an open wound, an open hurt, maybe especially from the church, which really wasn't your fault, but unaddressed and not dealt with before the Lord, sometimes that wound can lead to backsliding. The list goes on and on. But I wonder if any of you would be honest with yourself this morning and admit that perhaps you are backsliding. Abraham doesn't collapse here just before the finish line. Abraham turned around and walked backwards, walked the other way right before the finish line. He's right there. Look at your Bible. I know I'm skipping ahead and spoiling the story, but look at chapter 21, verse 1. Look at the header to it. In my Bible, it says the birth of Isaac. He's literally right there. The Lord visited Sarah, as he had said, and the Lord did to Sarah as he had promised. And Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age at the time at which God had spoken to him. He's right. I'm going to preach that next week. He's right there. He's literally, he can see the finish line. It's right before him and inches from the finish line, the promised child right before him. He's about to blow it all in fear and unbelief left to his own. He surely would blow it all. But here God interrupts the story, which leads us to the second scene and consecutive confrontations. Look with me at verse 3. Now we have Sarah, 90 years old, in another foreign king's harem, waiting her turn. Now, for the bizarre scene of Sarah being taken away as property and for pleasure at the age of 90. Again, I'm sure some of you might think, what? I refer you back to my comments several weeks or months ago on chapter 12. 90 in patriarchal times is not 90 today, but it was still old. Even if Sarah was regarded by all as beautiful and evidently she was, and even if there's some spectacular things going on with her, she's about to get pregnant. But even still, she's old. And one other thing I might add is a king like Abimelech uniting with another wealthy foreigner like Abraham, like Sarah, was often more about, we know this from history, was more about increasing political power and alliances and wealth than it was about raw lust or pleasure. At any rate, Sarah's in another foreign king's harem waiting her turn. And in the dark of the night, in the king's palace, God comes to Abimelech in a dream and abruptly confronts him. Look at verse 3. Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman you have taken, for she is a man's wife. This is the first confrontation here. I'm so thankful I've never had this nightmare, aren't you? Behold, you are a dead man, says the Almighty. Which leads Abimelech in this bizarre dream to plead his case in verses 4 and 5. Look at verses 4 and 5. Lord, will you kill an innocent people? Who does he sound like there? He sounds like Abraham back in chapter 18, interceding with the Lord on behalf of Sodom and Gomorrah. Lord, Lord, will you, will you kill an innocent people? Did he not tell me that she was his sister? Abimelech goes on. I'm innocent. I have my integrity. That word integrity, the word means unfractured or that's the original ideal. In other words, it means you're not duplicitous. You're not, you're not, you're not saying one thing over here, but what you really are is something. He's saying, I've been whole. I've been honest. I haven't touched her. And look at the Lord's reply to Abimelech. Verse 6. Yes, you have kept your integrity. And it was I who kept you from sinning against me. Isn't that interesting? Therefore, I, God says, did not let you touch her. Isn't that interesting? We're all fallen creatures. But that does not mean that any one of us is as depraved as we might be. So I believe and I believe that all of the Bible teaches the doctrine of total depravity. That means every single one of us, even those cute little babies out there, all of you are born into sin and sin has touched every fiber of your being, your moral being. We are sinners. No exceptions. But that doctrine does not teach that each of us or any of us is as sinful as we might be. And part of the reason that's true is the restraining work of the Holy Spirit. Jesus taught that when he comes, when the Holy Spirit comes, he will convict the world of sin and righteousness and judgment. Can you not look back over your life and think of times where, man, you really could have blown it. You really could have done something so awful and with such grave consequences. And it's actually the reason you did it, it's not that, you know, you thought better and you triumphed over or you were above it or you were so strong. There were just hindrances. There were just obstacles randomly there. And if not there, otherwise you might have been too weak. You might have indeed wrecked your own life and wrecked your testimony. I can say, I'll just say for me, I can think of times in my own life and circumstances in my own life where I could have done awful things, but I didn't for one reason or another. And a big reason was I couldn't. There was something there circumstantially that prevented me from the worst of myself exercising itself. I can't even think about it like this. Part of how I think about my own story. I became a Christian at exactly the right time and not a second too late for what could have happened, how much more damage could have been done. I'm just trying to point out sometimes God intervenes as he does here with Abimelech. Sometimes God intervenes in mercy and keeps us from the worst of ourselves. Now you don't dare, I don't dare presume upon that. You can't live recklessly counting on, well, God will keep me from doing too bad or from messing things up too badly. He will restrain me from that. No, the worst judgment here on this earth for rebels refusing to submit to God's will is for God to, quote, give them up. Romans 1. It's exactly what Romans 1 says God has done and is doing to his enemies who reject him. He's letting go of the restraining lease. He's letting them go their own way, which is the way of destruction and damnation. We don't presume upon this, but we should all at the same time thank God, the Holy Spirit, for his restraining mercy in our lives. What would we be had God not interrupted us and kept us from impulses inside? God has kept Abimelech from violating Sarah in any way. God has protected his covenant friends in spite of their own foolishness. And then we read in verse 7, now then, God says to Abimelech, now then return the man's wife, for he, Abraham, is a prophet. Return her so that he will pray for you and you shall live. But if you do not return her, know that you shall surely die and all who are yours. This is the first time, by the way, that the word prophet is used in the Bible. Big word in the Bible. First time it's used here. God is establishing Abraham as his, God's prophet. Abraham speaks for God. Abraham intercedes with God on the behalf of others, on the behalf of the nations, including Gerar. And God is mercifully establishing him as that here in spite of Abraham. Abimelech obeys God. By the way, Abimelech seems to genuinely fear God in a fascinating way. He seems to genuinely fear God, even if he doesn't know God as a friend like Abraham does. And so we read in verse 8, so Abimelech rose early in the morning and called his servants and told them all these things. And the men were very much afraid. So that's the first confrontation. The worst is about to happen. But God intervenes, restraining Abimelech and then coming to him in a dream. And then in verse 9, second confrontation, Abimelech comes to Abraham. He's awake now and he comes to Abraham and he is not happy. He has three questions for Abraham. Look at your Bibles. Verse 9, the first question, what have you done to us? Verse 9, second question, how have I sinned against you that you have brought on me and my kingdom such a great sin? And third question, verse 10, what did you see in us, in our people, that caused you to do this thing? He's saying, why, Abraham? Did I do something that I'm not aware of to deserve this? Did you find some fault in us? Abraham replies to Abimelech's three questions by giving three defenses. Look back at your Bibles, three defenses, three responses Abraham gives. Verse 11, first defense, I did it because I thought there's no fear of God here and they'll kill me because of my wife. Which, by the way, from Abimelech's actions, that just wasn't true. Second defense, verse 12, Abraham says, I did it because she, Sarah, is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, though not of my mother. She is his half sister. And his third response, his third defense, verse 13, and when God caused me to wander from my father's house, I said to my wife, this is the kindness you must do to me at every place to which we come. Say of me, he is my brother. What is Abraham doing here? He blames his deceit on Abimelech. You guys, I thought you guys were godless and would just kill us if you knew that this beautiful woman was my wife. He blames them. He justifies his half lie with, yes, Sarah, again, the old ruse, Sarah technically was his half sister. And then in verse 13, I wonder if you notice, it's subtle, I wonder if you noticed how Abraham began his final justification. When God caused me, do you remember in Genesis chapter three? God comes and confronts Adam. How did you know you were naked? Who told you you were naked? Did you eat of the fruit I told you not to eat? What did Adam say? The woman you gave to me, you hear the echo here in Abraham of the garden. Abraham subtly, implicitly blames God, just like Adam did. Do you ever blame God? We all do at times, don't we? We might not say it out loud. We might not be so foolish to speak the words like Abraham does, but we all blame God sometimes, don't we? What an absolute mess we have here, right before the promise. Let me ask you a question of the two men, Abraham and Abimelech, who appears the more righteous here? Abimelech is no saint, but he stands taller than Abraham here in his own integrity and innocence. And remember, tragically, Abraham is supposed to be the vehicle for God's blessing to all the nations, including here in Gerar. Can you imagine if in this moment, Abraham, after being confronted, after defending himself, can you imagine if in this moment Abraham said to Abimelech, Dear King, can I tell you about the good news of salvation? Might I tell you of how you might find righteousness like I found righteousness? No, thank you. From you, you're God's friend. This is righteousness. Have you ever been in a situation where you sort of hope the other person didn't find out you're a Christian? I remember my mom slapping, remember the fish, the ichthys, remember those 90s, 90s kids, the fish that represented I'm a follower of Jesus. My mom, when I was a teenager, slapped one of those on the back of my car, did not ask her to do that, did not approve, but she paid for the car so I so I didn't take it off. Plus, I was too ashamed to take it off. But as soon as she slapped it out there, I knew it was a massive mistake. Your integrity is critical to your witness. And let me just say that that goes for the home as much as it goes for the work, streets, the neighborhood. Mom and dad, you're going to mess up a lot. You're going to mess up a lot. I mess up, dad, a lot. And it's really important that our kids see us when we mess up, that they see us apologize and draw attention to the fact that, yes, that's why I trust in Jesus, too, because I need him to rescue me from my mistakes and from my sins. It's really important that your kids know that you know that you are a sinner, too. And let me just say this. If you are something, if you are fundamentally something behind closed doors, at home with kids, with wife, with husband, that you are not in public or are not in church, then good luck inviting your kids to believe. But Abraham has reverted back to his old ways, deceiving and manipulating. He's entirely compromised his witness as God's prophet, as God's vehicle for blessing to the nations. And yet third scene, glorious grace. Let me read for you verses 14 to 16. Then Abimelech, hearing Abraham's pathetic response, Abimelech took sheep and oxen and male servants and female servants and gave them to Abraham and returned Sarah, his wife, to him. And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before you. Dwell where it pleases you. And to Sarah, Abimelech said, Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. That is a lot. It is a sign of your innocence in the eyes of all who are with you and before everyone you are vindicated. Abraham becomes even richer and he's invited by the king to now be a citizen of Abimelech's land. He can now, not sojourn, he can now dwell there as a resident is what Abimelech is offering. A couple of months ago, I was preaching on Genesis and I preached the passage, Genesis 12, where we encountered the first episode of She's My Sister. But then afterwards, he'd been restored and blessed by God. And I got to that passage and I preached that passage. And then Abraham believed God and it was counted to him as righteousness in Genesis 15. And so he's on the right path, right? He's onward upward. And so I was preaching one of those, Abraham faithfully following God, having been restored. I was preaching one of those passages when we have one of our monthly college luncheons and we're talking about the sermon. They were kids ask any question they want. Young adults ask any questions they want. And one of the questions, one of the questions they asked me, one of them raised their hand and flipped ahead in the story and said, Yeah, yeah, but wait, doesn't Abraham do the same thing over again in just a few chapters? Yeah, he did. The story of Abraham is that if I could just map out the story of Abraham that we've seen so far from a big picture, it would go like this. He's called by God to go to a new land. Chapter 12. By faith, he follows God. By faith, he follows God. But almost immediately, when famine hits the land, he reverts back to fear and he tries to pawn off his wife to save his own hide. Fear conquers his faith before we even leave chapter 12, but then God restores him and blesses him anyways. Then he fights for God. Remember Abraham, the warrior, chapter 14, conquering nations and peoples to rescue the cities of the valley. And then in chapter 15, he believes God and it's counted to him as righteousness. Genesis 15, verse six. But then he doubts God again and he grows impatient and he takes his mistress, Hagar, and has a child with her. That's Genesis 16. But then he's blessed by God nonetheless. And he enters into a covenant with God and he becomes God's friend. Genesis 17. And then he dines with God and he pleads with God and he's heard by God and God really is his friend. That's Genesis 18. And then he becomes afraid again. He resorts back to his sinful, foolish behavior all over again and he ruins his witness with God. Do you see the pattern? Faith, called by God, faith, faith, falls, goes backwards, restored by God, blessed by God in spite of his folly, faith, faith some more, blessed more by God, falls again, rebels again, back and forth and back and forth we go. God keeps rescuing this guy who doesn't deserve it at all. Do you see how this story is working? I've told this before, but as a young Christian, I opened up the book because I wanted to grow and I tried to devour it starting in Genesis and I got hung up pretty quickly in the story. I had problems with the Bible almost immediately because the story did not make sense to me. Sin made, the first three chapters made perfect sense. God, the creator, check, man, the pinnacle of the creation, check, that makes sense, sin, awful, treason, death, wrath, punishment, that made so much sense to me, explains the world, explains my own heart, my own fallen desires. It also explains why the world is the way that it is under God's wrath. All that, Genesis 1 through 3, made perfect sense to me. Check, check, check, check, check. I'm good with it all. And then I got to Abraham. And God chose Abraham and God blessed Abraham and I was good with that. But then Abraham was a terrible husband and God forgave him once and I was probably OK with that. But then he was a terrible husband again and he kept doing the same sins again and again and again. And God kept blessing him in spite of it. And then later I got to Jacob and there were even more problems. God chose Jacob, too. Don't care about that. Fine, choose whoever you want to choose. You're God. And he blessed him. But Jacob was even worse than Abraham, even more of a liar, even more of a cheater. And on and on the story goes, multiple, these guys have multiple wives, adulterers, murderers. These are the best. This is David, the man after God's own heart. And I kept looking for some other way to read this or understand and talking to the people who were discipling me because it just made no sense to me that all the heroes in this story are kind of awful people. But God blessed them nonetheless. How does that make any sense? What's wrong with this story? What's wrong with these people? What was wrong with me reading and not understanding? I was looking the point of the story right in the eye, but still couldn't see it because I didn't think it could possibly be true. I still thought, well, no, God's blessing still has got to go. At the end of the day, it's got to go to the good guys because that's how stories work and that's how the world's got to work. And that's how God must work. Because deep down, I still believed in my heart that God rewards the good people and that nice guys and nice girls are the heroes of the Bible. And of course, the people who go to heaven. That's not the message of the story. That's not even close to the message of the story. That's not the gospel. That's not good. That's actually terrible news. If it's true, you know why it's terrible news? Because there are no heroes. And there are no fundamentally nice guys and nice girls and good people. God had nothing to work with. Genesis three on God had nothing to work with, not even a spark of potential in just a few nice human beings, not Abraham. Have you seen the evidence? Not Isaac, his son, not Jacob, not David, not Peter, not Paul. Nobody. Nobody was righteous. No, not one. Nobody even had the potential for righteousness. And so God came himself. And was born into humanity. And became the hero that we all want to believe in, but who is nowhere to be found in the pages of the story and in the pages and the annals of human history. And then God died for losers and deceivers and backsliders and anybody who will just trust him and give him their life, for he gave his life for theirs. All Abraham had was faith. And sometimes faltering faith at that. He just believed God, all you must have is faith. That's the invitation. That's the message of the entire Bible. Just believe all you've got to have is faith, faith to give your life to God, faith to follow God, faith to learn to obey God, faith to when you stumble and fall down and go backwards and play the fool and ruin your witness and sin horribly. Faith to turn around and repent and keep on following God. That's the gospel. That is good news. God does it all. God did it all. Jesus, the hero, the only hero, Jesus, the Savior. That's good news. Grace, grace, God's grace, grace that is greater than all of our sin. That's Genesis chapter 20. That's the entire Bible. Abraham's rescued. Abraham's even richer. And Abraham's restored. God, in spite of everything, appoints Abraham. Remember, this is his appointed man. God here appoints him to play the role of the prophet. Verse 17, Abraham prays to God. Do you see what's happening here? God's restoring him. God didn't heal Abimelech or Abimelech's household until his man, Abraham, who had just fallen and been a complete and utter fool, until Abraham stood in the gap and prayed for them because God appointed Abraham to this task. And here God is restoring Abraham. Verse 17, then Abraham prayed to God and God healed Abimelech and also healed his wife and female slaves so that they bore children. For the Lord had closed all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham's wife. Grace, glorious grace. Could God possibly be this gracious to you or me? Lot fell down last chapter. Abraham fell down this chapter, seconds before God came through. You are so close. I don't care who you are, how old you are, how great your health is. I don't care if you have five years, 50 years, 75 years. You are so close. Eternity is right across the horizon. There awaits at the finish line, reward, every single one of God's promises, visible. Don't fall back. Don't turn back. Don't live your life by fear. Don't give up and don't quit now. We're so close. Don't waste your life on entertainment and pleasure and a thousand little distractions. Everything awaits in the next life. Jesus is worth it and so much better than you can imagine. If you have fallen down and are backslidden, I invite you to repent. I invite you to repent today, even now. And I invite you by faith to get back up and let's go on to God. Let's pray. God, thank you for Abraham and the weird help that his blunders give to us. And the strange hope that his constant faltering brings to us. For we ourselves, God, are foolish and easily deceived and prone to wonder, oh, boy, do we feel it? Oh, God. God, I pray for the one here under the sound of my voice now who is cold, if not dead, to your word, to your voice. God, we're asking you by your power to interrupt their life, interrupt their soul, just like you did Abimelech, just like you did Abraham. And rescue them and restore them to grace and restore them to obedience, or God, save them for the very first time. Remove scales of blindness which blind us from the gospel of the glory of God in the face of Christ Jesus, which is so much better than everything in this world. God, increase our faith as a family. And we pray all these things in Jesus' name, amen.
