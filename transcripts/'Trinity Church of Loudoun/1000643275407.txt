Acts 1, 6 through 11. So when they had come together, they asked him, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? He said to them, it is not for you to know times or seasons that the father has fixed by his own authority. But you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the end of the earth. And when he had said these things, as they were looking on, he was lifted up and a cloud took him out of their sight. And when they were gazing into heaven, as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white robes and said, men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This is Jesus who was taken up from you into heaven will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven. This is the word of the Lord. The most catastrophic event in the history of the world is recorded for us in the Bible in Genesis chapter three. When Adam fell, everything changed. A bright world filled with colors turned black and white, stained by sin, guilt and estrangement entered into our world. Alienation, exile entered into our world, demons and darkness. In that moment, in Genesis three, we're given a new playground in our world. Disease and death entered into our world all in that moment. You know, all of us know here this morning, guilt and punishment and anxiety because of Genesis three. You all know of shame and of loneliness because of Genesis three. You all know of darkness, of evil things done in the night because of Genesis three. You know of the names of Hitler and Stalin and Bin Laden because of Genesis three. You know of famines and earthquakes and tornadoes and fires and shark attacks and cancer and so much more because of Genesis three. You know of death. You've all attended funerals because of Genesis three someday. Others will attend your funeral as you all die. We all will die because of Genesis chapter three. That's my third run with that introduction. I don't make money for sermons directly, but I am paid by the church and so if you were to monetize those two paragraphs, that would be my most lucrative introduction. And I retire it this week as we this morning come to the final installment of a three-week series in which I've done my best to show you one last time how the climax of Jesus' life and especially His cross, His suffering and His death and His burial in the grave, the cross, His resurrection, Easter Sunday morning, His getting up out of the grave to new life, glorified resurrection life, and now finally this morning, His ascension back into heaven. How the climax of Jesus' life, His death, His resurrection and the ascension ultimately undo every single effect of Genesis three, all those maladies from Genesis three for any and for all who would trust in Jesus Christ as their Savior and King. I showed you week one five achievements of the cross, the forgiveness of sins, the justification of the ungodly, the redemption of slaves, the enslaved, victory over demons and dark powers and final ultimate healing assured for all who trust in Christ. I showed you last week five more achievements, accomplishments flowing out of the resurrection, the appointment, the fixing, the designation of Jesus Christ as King of kings and Lord of lords, Romans one, living hope even in this life now for all who believe in His name. Judgment coming to all who reject Him, Bin Laden, Hitler, your neighbor who rejects Him. Judgment coming to everything evil and everything and everyone allied to evil. Friendly bodies, sin, sickness, stricken bodies, glorified like Jesus, glorified body after the resurrection because of His resurrection and finally eternal life, real life for all who trust in Him. What a glorious salvation flowing forth from Jesus' death and resurrection, amen? Easter week, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, what a glorious salvation just flowing forth from that week and those final events and yet we're not done because the work wasn't finished. His work was not finished on Easter morning and I mean by that the work of your salvation if you trust in Christ. That sounds wrong to say, doesn't it? Oh, wait a second, pastor. The cross, His death and the resurrection not yet complete. That's what I'm saying this morning. That's what I think the Bible teaches. Your salvation was not yet perfected on Easter Sunday morning. Jesus had still more work to do. That's the point of this final installment as this morning we look and we conclude this series with a look at the final climactic act of Jesus' perfect work of salvation. It comes to a completion this morning as we look together at the ascension. Now because this is by far the least familiar aspect of Jesus' final work. How many of you have ever heard a sermon on the ascension? You're all Anglican or something like that, the few of you who just raised your hands or maybe I might have preached on the ascension a few years ago, I can't remember to be honest. Very few of us, literally like five hands just went up. Very few of us have ever heard a sermon on this final climactic act of Jesus. One writer called the ascension easily one of, quote, easily one of the most neglected truths of the Christian faith. Because that's true, I want to say still more and a little bit more than the past few weeks on the front end about the ascension before diving into what it has achieved for you and all of you if you trust in Christ. The ascension story is told for us twice in the Bible. By the same author actually, it's told very briefly at the end of Luke's gospel. And then it's told as the author Luke transitions to his next book, the second part of his two part volume, the book of Acts, in the very beginning of Acts, it's told again in more detail with that passage, those few verses which Holly just read. That's it. And actually the Bible talks about the ascension a lot. Jesus actually talked about it a lot. It's one of those things, if you're a Christian, if you've read your Bible, if you've been reading your Bible for a while, you've probably read about it a lot and are very familiar with it and you just didn't realize you were reading about it. And the main reason for that is because what we tend to do, it's not that we hate the ascension, it's not that we're against the ascension or somebody was against it and they poisoned you without knowing it. The reason that's true that we don't give much attention to the ascension or we overlook it even as we read about it right before our eyes is because we tend to attach it to and see it as one with the resurrection. And I want to be clear, the ascension and the resurrection are very much related. You could even say they're over overlapping in the same sense that the cross for that matter is very much related to the resurrection. It is very true to say that these three aspects I'm looking at, cross, resurrection, ascension are all one work and yet the Bible talks about all of them distinctly, including the ascension. Let me show you that just briefly. The Bible, let me show you, consistently distinguishes between even the resurrection and the ascension as two separate events with overlapping but distinct outcomes. Let me give you just a quick taste. I could show you so much more here, but you don't have to turn here, but John 20, John chapter 20, verse 17, this is Jesus who is resurrected already from the dead. Speaking to his friend, Mary Magdalene, he's already been resurrected. You have to, that's critical context for what I'm about to read for you. Resurrection. Resurrected. Jesus said to her, do not cling to me for I have not yet ascended to the father. He's already been resurrected, but he's saying, I have not yet ascended to the father, but go, he says to my brothers and say to them, I am ascending to my father and your father, to my God and your God. Can you see clearly their resurrection ascension distinct? Jesus has done one, completed the one, but not yet the other. Now once you see that, once you grant that, oh, they're separate things. Now you can start to open up all kinds of new budded flowers. It's everywhere in the Bible. John, let me just give you a little bit more. John 3, 13 through 15. You don't have to turn there. Jesus speaking here again. No one, familiar words, no one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven, the son of the son of man. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the son of man be lifted up so that whoever believes in him may have eternal life. I know if you're a Christian, you've heard those verses before. So one of the most famous parts of the Bible, I bet you perhaps haven't thought of those verses and that imagery as going with the ascension. The son of man must be lifted up like a serpent in the wilderness. So long ago in the Old Testament, so that everyone who looks upon him and believes in him will be granted eternal life. Jesus was speaking there of the ascension. First Timothy 3, 16, Paul writing, great indeed, we confess, is the mystery of godliness. Here it is. He, Christ, was manifested in the flesh, vindicated by the spirit, seen by the angels, proclaimed among the nations. Remember the worship song in the 90s we used to sing, maybe you didn't use to sing that. Just going through that. He was manifested in the flesh, vindicated by the spirit, seen by the angels, proclaimed among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory. Ascension. You might start as you're reading your Bible on your own, you might start looking for this and paying more attention and you might be thrilled to discover as you're reading your Bible just how often it comes up. It's everywhere once you see it. Jesus' resurrection last week was a two-part act. There was Easter Sunday morning where he got up out of the grave. He came back to life, defeating death. But the resurrection as it's recorded in the Bible goes beyond that to those 40 days after he got up out of the grave where he was seen by some, Paul says, 500 witnesses where he demonstrated, he proved to them, Paul says, the veracity of his resurrection. He opened up the Bible to them, the scriptures, and taught them things about the kingdom of God. He unlocked riches for them. All of that, those Easter Sunday and those 40 days after, all of that theologically speaking from the Bible's perspective, that's all resurrection. But at that point, after 40 days, the Bible records the ascension. The details are rather simple and yet staggering. They are as follows. First, he lifted up his hands and he blessed them. He gave a parting benediction, Luke 24 verse 50 says. Second, while blessing them, like mid-blessing, Acts says that he was lifted up as a cloud appears. Now, that's so strange that it seems fantastical. That's the sort of thing that, you know, if you're a Christian explaining what you believe to somebody who's not a Christian, you start to feel maybe even a little embarrassed. Really, guys, a cloud appeared and he rode on a cloud back up to heaven. Sounds like a cartoon. But actually, if you understand the story of the Bible and the significant roles that the clouds play, there's a lot happening here. Remember when God had the Israelites build the tabernacle, this portable place of his presence and worship, and he rested over it during the night by fire, but during the day by cloud, which moved with the tabernacle as it moved. The final verse of Exodus, critical book in the Bible, the final verse of Exodus speaks of this cloud. Later, when Solomon, when the tabernacle gives way to the full glory of the temple, after Solomon, David's son, builds the temple, the ark is brought in, signifying the presence of God, the holiest of objects, the ark of the covenant is brought in. We read in that moment that the temple was so filled by a cloud, just imagine the haze, the fog everywhere, the temple was so filled by a cloud that the priests could not perform their duties for 2 Chronicles 5 says, the glory of the Lord had filled the house. When Jesus was transfigured on the mountain, remember he took, he takes Peter, James and John up on a high mountain and then he pulls back the veil and shows them his true nature, he shows them his divinity. When Jesus was transfigured, we read that a bright cloud overshadowed them and a voice spoke from the cloud, this is my beloved son, Matthew 17 5. This cloud in Acts 1, whatever that looked like, we weren't there, whatever that looked like to the disciples eyes, it clearly represents, if you've been reading your Bible, the presence, the intimate presence and the glory of the Lord. Now enveloping Jesus for his final act. So the ascension, simple, 3 parts, he blesses them with his hands raised, he departs from them upon and enveloped by a cloud and finally, they watched him and we weirdly watched them watching him as he went up and as he departed from them, this time in a decisive way. He now really is gone physically from their presence. You can see there in Acts 1, if you're there, they're locked in a day's stare when 2 angels appear, by the way, 2 angels appearing, think of that, we've seen that before, just like Abraham at the Oaks of Mamre, right before Sodom and Gomorrah are destroyed. Just like the tomb of Jesus, Mary Magdalene comes back to the tomb, she's found it's empty, she brings her friends with me, who's in the tomb, 2 angels, are these the same 2 angels? Why do you stare, they ask? He will come again in the same way. That's the ascension, that's it. It's strange, but it's glorious and it's the glorious final act to Jesus' incarnation, his time here upon earth and so, without further ado and alas, let me wrap up this series by showing you 3 achievements of the ascension. I know I've given you 5 achievements of the cross and 5 achievements of the resurrection and I'm breaking my streak here and let me be so clear, there are 5 and so many more achievements of the ascension, but I'd also, in addition to giving you the achievements of the ascension, like to not kill you with a 90-minute sermon here. And so, 3 achievements of the ascension. The ascension gives you 3 things if you believe in Christ. First, a priest in heaven. A priest in heaven. One of the books, it's interesting, where the ascension features most prominently is the book of Hebrews, which is the book about Jesus, our great high priest. Salvation in Hebrews, God's triumph in Hebrews is attached to the perfect man, Jesus Christ, ascending into the heavens to serve as our great high priest eternally. Let me show you, you don't have to turn there, but let me just give you a bit from hopping around the book of Hebrews to show you this one point. Hebrews 4.14, since then, the author says, since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens. That's his ascending, that's an image of the ascension. He has ascended into heaven and he's filled the heavens. He's passed through the heavens. Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens. Jesus, the son of God, let us hold fast our confession. Hebrews 9.11 and 12, but when Christ appeared as a great high priest of the things to come, of the good things that have come, verse 12 says, he entered once for all into the holy places. That's speaking of heaven, the true temple, the true holy of holies. He entered once for all into the holy places, ascension, not by means of the blood of goats and calves, but by means of his own blood, thus securing an eternal redemption. Hebrews 9.24, just later in the chapter, we read for Christ has entered not into holy places made with hands, the tabernacle, the temples, even Solomon's temple, not into holy places made with hands, which are copies or shadows of the true things. But he has entered. Christ has entered into heaven itself. Now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf. Do you hear how the author of Hebrews is repeatedly again and again and again connecting our salvation is wrapped up in this connection. Jesus Christ ascended into heaven to serve as our great high priest. Here was the goal of his ascension. Now you just read this for the first time. It almost feels like a, like a, like a, I don't know, like a, like a little magic trick. Like now you see me. Now you don't. Ta-da disciples. One last miracle. That's not the point of the ascension. The goal of the ascension was for the son of God, having become the son of man to enter into heaven to Hebrew says, pass through the heavens by means of his own blood in order to serve eternally as our great high priests. We who believe you have, if you're a Christian, you have a priest in heaven forever. And let me tell you what that means for you. This very moment, this day and every day, you have a priest in heaven. And let me tell you what that means for you. Why? Well, think about this. Why shouldn't you be crushed right now for anything that's misfiring in your heart as you're sitting under the word of God being preached? Why shouldn't I be silenced or struck down right now for anything that's misfiring in my heart, even as I'm standing on behalf of God, doing such a sacred thing as speaking on his, but daring having the audacity to speak on his behalf. Why shouldn't I be struck down? Why shouldn't I be silenced? This is why. Hebrews seven, the former priests, they were many a number because they were prevented by death from continuing in their office. But Jesus holds his priesthood permanently because he continues forever. Consequently, he is able to save to the uttermost. Save completely, perfectly saved to the uttermost. Those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives, always lives to make intercession for them. That's why we're alive right now. In spite of our sins, this is what it means that you have a high priest, Jesus in the heavens right now. Romans eight, verse 34, who is to condemn? Christ, Jesus is the one who died more than that, who was raised, who is now at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us. What does it mean that we have a priest in heaven? It means that right now, right? I mean, right now, Jesus is at the right hand of God and he's praying for you. And he's praying for us. Now, I'm not he's not confined there spatially, and that's certainly not all he's doing. I don't pretend to understand how all that works, but it's true right now. It'll be true tomorrow and it'll be true forever. He always Hebrew says he lives to make intercession for us. Who is to condemn? Therefore, Paul says. Who's going to condemn? Satan is called Revelation 12. Satan is called the accuser of the brethren day and night. He lives to bring accusations against God's elect. So think about the implications of this. Now, Satan, the the one who's he Jesus lives eternally to make intercession. Satan lives eternally to accuse, we might say, from the Bible. Now imagine what happens. Satan, the accuser has to go through him. All right, this is my impression of Satan. I'm not going to try to do the voice. All right, I got another one. Wait for it, God. Let me tell you about last night. Let me tell you about last week. Let me tell you about his last week. Let me tell you about her last night. Now he comes. Satan comes bringing those actual accusations and he comes to the great high priest with nail pierced hands, nail pierced hands from his having taken their punishment. Let me be clear. The picture is not of in Hebrews or otherwise. The picture is not of God, the father who's angry at you or resistant to saving you. Who's just wanting to unleash lightning bolts against you. But thankfully, Jesus is there holding him back and pleading for us. No father, son, Holy Spirit, all of God is entirely for you. If you believe. Everyone who worships Christ as king has him as his priest and has all of God. And yet the Bible is clear. Jesus has been eternally designated as the high priest atoning for our sins by his precious blood and pleading for our cause by his powerful prayers, taking our prayers, our imperfect prayers. Well, you ever, what if I pray the wrong things? What if I say the wrong, I remember I was preaching one time and I meant to say Jesus, the, uh, the, the perfect savior. And I said, instead, Jesus, the perfect center. And I didn't know somebody told me afterwards and everybody started making fun of me for, I had no idea you ever, you ever think about what, what if you, what are you accidentally pray the wrong thing? And you meant to say a different word, but, but you didn't. What if, what if I prayed something that was, was actually the worst thing I could pray? I didn't know it because I'm so finite limited. And I don't know what's best for me, but I prayed it because I thought it was best for me, but actually it would destroy me. You ever thought about things like this, panicked about this? Maybe not because you prayed the wrong thing. Panicked about this. Maybe not because you think, well, God knows what I mean. And I got a good heart. No, you don't. And this is the same God who struck as a dead for trying to save the art from falling to the ground and getting mud all over it. No, you will be okay. Whatever you pray, however you pray, because you have an intercessor whose words are perfect, who takes our words and makes them what they should be, who joins our feeble words, weak words, shortened words to his powerful words, who even Roman says, interprets our groans to the father. In revelation chapter eight, the prayers of the saints are offered up to heaven, wild image, but the prayers of the saints are offered up to heaven. Just like a few moments ago, when I prayed on our behalf, just like this morning, when you were praying on the car right here and the kids, you were wondering if you're going to be able to make it to church and still be a Christian. By the time you got here, the prayers of the saints are offered up to heaven and revelation eight says they're sprinkled with incense or with perfume upon a golden altar before they reach the throne. Whatever that looks like, it's an image of Christ, our forever priest, perfecting our prayers before bringing them to God. One writer said, and I quote, our great high priest continually perfumes the prayers of his people and puts pressure within his people to groan for the right things, perfumes and pressures. I love that our priest in heaven. If Jesus is still on this earth, even having been died, even having been buried and resurrected from the grave, none of that's true. We have a priest in heaven, second achievement of the Ascension, a spirit poured out, a spirit poured out. I'm going to read here from Acts, the beginning of Acts. You can turn there if you like, but once again, I don't back in Genesis next week. I've loved this, but I'm kind of excited, to be honest, because it's exhausting. Acts chapter two, I'm going to read there. You can turn there if you like. Acts chapter two, verse thirty three. This is Peter preaching at Pentecost. Acts chapter two, verse thirty three. Peter in a sermon says, being therefore speaking of Jesus, being therefore exalted at the right hand of God. And having received from the father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing. We need to notice that the. Promised outpouring of the Holy Spirit, which Peter saying you're not seeing it, it's now happened at Pentecost. I want you to notice that the promised outpouring of the Holy Spirit only came after he was exalted. Jesus was exalted at the right hand of the father. In other words, the promised outpouring of the Holy Spirit only comes after the ascension. And that's, by the way, exactly how Jesus had told them it would happen and how it had to happen earlier. The verses at the beginning of Acts, look back at Acts chapter one. Acts chapter one, verse four. And while staying with them, this is the resurrected Jesus. But before he's departed. And while staying with them, he ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the father, which he said, you've heard from me for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now. Look down at verse eight. He goes on, but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in Judea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth. Then Paul's commentary. Then he ascends, blesses them, departs. They see him upon the cloud. The ascension happens. And then we read chapter two, verse two. Look, look ahead. Chapter two, verse two. And suddenly now there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind. And it filled the entire house where they were sitting and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit. You see the order there. That's the way Jesus said it was going to be. And it had to be, by the way, Jesus said this much earlier in the gospels before the book of Acts, John 16, verse seven. Nevertheless, he says to his disciples, I tell you the truth. It is to your advantage that I go away. For if I do not go away, the helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you. That's one of the more confusing things that Jesus says, isn't it? How could it possibly be to their advantage to anyone's advantage? How could it be better for the disciples? If Jesus, the son of God, the second person of the Trinity left, even if the spirit does then come, how can that be? No chance. That's true. He's the son of God. They never had to pay for a meal in their life. Why have you ever thought about this? Why is it better to have the spirit? Even than to have the physical presence of the son of God, Jesus Christ. Why is it better? Two reasons I'll give you just briefly. I'm sure there are more. First, global presence. Second, full story. Global presence, full story. First, global presence. Think about it. When Jesus was on the earth, he was confined to one single space. Now he did amazing things. He performed miracles. He unlocked the Bible, God's word for everyone who sat under his teaching, but he was never in two places at once. He was five foot nine or I don't, I don't know how tall he was, but actually estimates of Jewish men, the average height around that time. I think that he would have been pretty tall if he was five foot nine, he was limited. He slept in a single bed at night. But when he goes up, what happens? The spirit comes down and then the spirit goes out everywhere, everywhere. The gospel is everywhere. The church is there. The spirit is. And so there, the presence of Christ is in a little bit, depending on how long this sermon goes, we'll all disperse from this room. It will be sad, but also the spirit will go with every single one of us who are in Christ. No matter where we go, whether we go north, south, east, west, Chipotle, somewhere fancy Burger King, it doesn't matter. The spirit will go with us because that's the promise of Jesus global presence. Maybe by the way, this helps a little bit as well with what Jesus meant when he said, you will do even greater works than I. What this sheds a little light potentially, doesn't it? Spirit takes the presence of Christ everywhere where all Christ's people are. And second, it's to your advantage for Christ to go because that means the spirit coming full story. Nobody, nobody would want to lose Jesus. All his followers, they left everything for him. When he died, the disciples were all lost, scattered, confused, saying unhelpful things. Everybody named Mary who knew him is crying. It was, he was everything to them, but if you think about it, the full story wasn't yet written. He's, he had to die. He had to rise and yes, he had to ascend to his father that and all of that was the gospel. They needed it just like we need it. And the gospel, if you think about it, it required his departing in order to be completed. In order to be completed. So let me give you a weird scenario. If you had the option right now to somehow, whether by magic or by the Holy Spirit to option A option B option A, you can stay right here where you are sitting under this sermon in this church preached by me. Option B, you can be transported back to 2000 years ago into the Judean wilderness. And you can rather choose instead to sit under a sermon of John the Baptist crying out shirtless in the wilderness. Now don't answer allow, but which would you choose? I know you choose John the Baptist and I wouldn't be offended. I would too out of sheer curiosity. If nothing more, I want to make the case to you, you'd be making the wrong choice. I know how ridiculous that sounds. And I need you to hear me carefully on this because I'm under no illusions that my mother is correct in believing I am the greatest preacher in the history of the world. But I need, I need, I want you to think about this. John's message crying out in the wilderness was what? Repent for the lamb of God is coming. He's going to take away the sins of the world. That's a great message. That's a true message. I would be so audacious as to say, I have a better message. I have this message. Behold, the lamb of God has come to take away the sins of the world. Behold, the lamb of God has lived the perfect life that you've all failed to live. That God requires each of us to live to gain his presence. Behold, the lamb of God has taken his perfect life. And he's used that perfect life with perfect hands to carry and then ascend across in order to die the death that you and I deserve for our sins. Behold, the lamb of God has been buried. Behold, the lamb of God has then been raised gloriously three days later from the dead, defeating death, which could not possibly hold him. Behold, still further, the lamb of God, after 40 days of demonstrating proofs, signs opening up, the Bible has been gone back to his father, passed through the heavens, completing finally forever, the perfect salvation of God. Behold, the lamb of God. Nobody can be that sermon has nothing to do with me. It has nothing to do with who preaches. It has everything to do with Jesus has completed the work. Jesus has completed the story. It's now finished. And so, yeah, it's to our advantage that Jesus go up and the Spirit come down to help us to tell that story. If you're here this morning and you're not yet a believer, so thankful you're here. Every week we have people here who are investigating or somebody dragged them in here or whatever. They don't yet believe. They're not sure if they believe. Let me say, as always, you're our honored guest. We're so glad that you're here. You can keep on coming forever, even if you never believe. But I want to be clear to you. If that's you, that is the message of this book. And it is not a message you look at and you learn and you check off a box and then you just move on and try to learn. So it's a message that requires everything. It's a message. Jesus says it's a treasure. If you discover the field where that treasure is, it's worth selling everything. Every other possession you've ever had, you ever own for the sake of just getting that treasure. Because this message is everything. It's life over death. It's eternal life. It's real life. If you'll only believe, if you'll only give everything else up, every other love, every other thing you've worshiped for that, that's what repentance means for that to receive that, to take Jesus as King. Well, that's what's changed all of our lives. And for that message to be full, Jesus had to depart. Jesus goes up, spirit comes down, spirit goes out. This empowers the global mission of the church. It is not an accident that Jesus' final word, final promise before ascending is spirit empowered witness. Acts 1-8 in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth. Leesburg, Loudoun County, Northern Virginia, Eastern Seaboard, United States, all the earth. It is no coincidence that Jesus made that promise, gave that commission right before the ascension. Think about it. During his earthly ministry, Jesus, again, along with being confined to a single space, he never really traveled that far. His travels are relatively small radius within the very small country of Israel. Look at the map. It's tiny. But then he ascended from Israel to heaven and as the King of not just Israel, but as the King of every nation and now possessing all authority, which is why he then turns around and sends his disciples and every single one of us to every nation. Why? Because he now has rights and authority, possession over every single nation. If you're a Christian, caring about missions is not optional. It is the concern of all of us. That's why most weeks we pray for some unreached or underreached nation, not exactly to just make the point, but more to cultivate the heart, which we all need to cultivate, which is Jesus' heart for all the nations. Wherever you're from this morning, Jesus wants you because he's building a bride from every nation. I encourage you to attend, whether you're a member here or visiting or whatever. If you're new in a couple of weeks, we have our annual missions banquet. I encourage you to attend that to get a glimpse just for one night of some of a small taste of the remarkable things which Jesus is still doing by his spirit across all the world and all the nations and to further cultivate that heart a little bit more. This empowers Jesus sending the spirit after his ascension and empowers the global mission of the church. It also equips the spiritual maturity of the church. Ephesians chapter four, you don't have to turn there, but Paul says that Jesus ascended. It's everywhere. I'm telling you, he ascended. It's quoting Psalm 68 here. Jesus ascended far above all the heavens, and now he says he's poured out gifts upon the church. It's like one glorious Christmas morning shower from the throne of heaven, from Jesus Christ himself. So he gives, Paul says Ephesians four, apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers. He gives, according to Paul, teaching gifts, serving gifts, healing gifts, administrative gifts, all for one purpose to build up the body, the church, so that she might not be destroyed by the devil or by false teachers, but so that she might rather reach to full maturity. If you're here this morning and you are a follower of Jesus, God intends to gift you with particular gifts to serve the church. And there are no exceptions to what I just said. Now, I imagine there are many of you who would understand yourself to be followers of Jesus, but would be honest and say, I have no idea what my gifts are. And that's okay. It's not okay forever, but it's okay and just honest that you're there. But if you don't know what your gifts are, I would say that's not definitely, but likely for one of two or both different reasons. Let me give them to you. Reason number one, it might be perhaps you don't know what your gifts are because you are not growing as a Christian. Maybe there's some sin or some secrecy, some resistance in your heart, some solitude you're choosing to live in for whatever reason. Or a hundred other reasons. So it's worth asking, are you growing as a Christian? And if you're not, why aren't you? Do you see the danger of that? Living things grow. So gifts show themselves normally as we mature and as we grow. So that might be the first reason. The second reason is this, might be this, perhaps you're not really invested in and growing more deeply into the local church. I say this because, well, lots of reasons, the norm in the Bible is a, if I could put it like this, a church centric life. You live your life locked into, and I would even say revolving around the local church. The norm in American evangelicalism over the last 50 years or so is, if I can make up a word, a church fringic life. Now, why does that matter? That matters because gifts also tend to show themselves, not just in the context of growing spiritually, individually maturing. They also tend to show themselves in the context of a local church. In other words, when you invest, when you figure out where needs are and you step into those needs, when you see someone hurting or alone and you step in to serve that person, when you know more people and when you're known more by other people, ah, it's in that moment that gifts arise. Why? Because it's in those moments that Jesus sends his spirit to empower and equip the saints to serve the church. It's the purpose of the gifts. As Paul states them, you probably need others to help you to see your gifts and how God really is using you. So often healthy Christians, maturing Christians serving their local churches, they might not even be aware of how powerfully their gifts are operating. Why? Because I don't know. I just showed up early on Sunday. And this need was there and he said, I saw this person was hurting or crying. And so I went and I served them and I prayed alongside them. And even in that situation, that's wonderful. But we need that person or other people in the context of a church say, Hey, do you actually realize how powerfully your actions or words have been used to help me and change my life? That's gifts working. You might not even realize it, but the local church is helping you to see that. Do you see? You, let me say it like this. You, let me say it like this. You would never discover spiritual gifts living on a desert Island. That's not what spiritual gifts are like. I've got an individual superpower. I can fly in Jesus. No, that's not what a gift is. It's, it's given in the context of a body, a church. I'm not saying any of this to shame any of you, but I will say it's not too late to change. And if I understand my Bible, we need you and every single one of you who have joined yourself to this church body. We need all of you to become all of what God means us to be, to grow into this mature body. Paul speaks of, we will not get there without you. Spirit empowers us. The spirit equips us. The spirit helps us. That's his name. Jesus calls him the helper, the counselor. Even right now, he's helped, especially right now. He said, if right now, as, as you sit under this preached word. If right now stuff's happening, you know, you, things are coming alive in your mind. Something's happening in your heart. If, if, if, if leaving here today at lunch this afternoon and you're in your marriage with your family tonight, as you, as you meet with other Christians around a small group or wherever, if it's actually affecting you and changing you, why is that? It's not because you're smart or intelligent. There's so many people. There's so many people. There are always people who are more intelligent. There's so many people who have amazing intellectual gifts to take this book. They might not even believe it. Take this book, open it up and dissect it in amazing ways, which you or I could never even touch. And yet they're unfazed. They're cool to it. They're aloof to it. Why? What's the difference? The risen ascended Lord Christ is pouring out his spirit to your life, to your heart, to your mind, to cause that change, to affect things that are happening in you who believe. We have a spirit poured out. Finally, third achievement of the ascension, a place prepared, a place prepared. I'm going to, I'm going to, you can turn here or not one last time, but I'm going to look at John chapter 14. John chapter 14, Jesus, again, preaching to his disciples, comforting his disciples. He says this famous words, let not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God. Believe also in me. In my father's house, there are many rooms. If it were not so what I have told you that I go there to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and take you to myself that where I am, you may be also Jesus spoke. Are there any more precious words in all the Bible? Jesus spoke these words beginning with let not your hearts be troubled right after telling his disciples that there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a trader in their midst. And also right after telling them that he was about to leave them. Imagine that moment. Yeah, they were troubled. They had every right to be troubled in this moment. You and I here this morning suffer no lack of reasons to be troubled, do we? We fear disease and death. We fear dictators and devils. We go through seasons of rejection where we feel completely alone. We're afraid of being alone, even when we're not alone. And so many of us are scared to death of hell. Are you afraid of hell this morning? Of waking up one second later on the other side of eternity to the worst surprise imaginable. Let not your hearts be troubled. Jesus says, believe in God. Believe also in me. It's all, it's all, it's almost like he's saying here, look, you believe in God. Look at me, look at my eyes, believe in me, believe my words again to everyone in this room, wherever you stand, if I could give you just one word this morning, it'd be to look at Jesus and don't look away. Believe in God, believe also in me. And then he promises rooms. What in the world? He promises mansion. Some translations have it. And he promises a place. I've regularly tried to show you for months and now years. I just realized how long I've been preaching Genesis on and off intermittently this past week. When somebody pointed out to me, oh boy, I'm going to try to finish it as soon as we get back. I've regularly tried to show you through Genesis and throughout the Bible, how central to the Bible's plot line is the theme of place. It's one of those big three promises God first gave to Abraham, people, place and blessing. Those are the big three. They just from there ripple out into all the rest of the Bible. They crease. You could say every single one of its pages, place. My grandpa, one of my grandpas, late grandpas, all my grandpas have passed now. He used to, he believed all kinds of insane stuff, bizarre stuff about the Bible, about God, way too many TV preachers, way too little church. And so he would say all kinds of crazy things. But one of his favorite things to say for as long as I can remember, and up to his last day, he would quote in his own words, he would quote this verse. And he would look at me and it was weird, but he would say, he would say, many mansions. That's how he taught. There I go. And he'd point his long bony finger at it. There I go to prepare a place for you. That was one of his favorite things. I imagine some of you are imagining right now. This is a very sweet moment where an older man, a grandfather is coming to his, you know, fresh out of seminary pastor grandson to get his pastor grandson's thoughts on. I can assure you he had no interest in my thoughts on the Bible whatsoever. In this moment, we were in church. He was the pastor. I was the one member of his church and I was cornered in the pew and I had nowhere to go. There I go to prepare a place for you. He got so many things wrong about the Bible, but he got that verse right because he wanted it so badly to be true. I mean, don't you all want this to be true? For there to really be a place. To belong. Place to be loved. Place to be wanted someplace to be safe, even in the afterlife. Someplace to call home and forever. I showed you last week how the Bible attaches Jesus resurrection to eternal life. For all who believe Easter morning, Jesus secured eternal life. Real life. We talked about life is God minted eternal joy right then. Even right now, if you know Christ, but his work was not finished. Why? Because the place was not prepared. Lots had been secured, but the houses hadn't been built. Designs had been submitted, but the rooms were not yet furnished. Now, I don't want you to stumble over the imagery here. Really, we got a guy traveling on a portable cloud and now we got mansions. Really? A mansion? Here's what I would say. Jesus spoke of heaven using lots of different images. Mansions, many rooms, streets of gold, rivers of life, Jasper, all kinds of precious jewels. And of course, the Bible ends with God bringing earth and heaven back together again as one. The new heavens and the new earth is the final destiny of all who believe. I have lots of thoughts on this, on that from the Bible. Even more questions. But here's what I would say to you. Two things if you're caught up on the imagery. Number one, those signs, those images, mansions, rooms, gold, they're all pointing to some reality. And whatever that reality is, it's only more glorious than whatever your imagination does. When you hear of those signs and wonders. Why? For no eye has seen, no ear has heard, no heart has imagined what God has prepared for those who love him. So whatever it is, whatever it looks like, I don't pretend to know all of it. I know that, I know that it's glorious. It's only more glorious than what you can concoct based upon Jesus' words. Second thing I would say, and in some ways this may be the most, very most important thing to say, to grasp all of them saying about the ascension. And that is this, whatever that place looks like, smells like, sounds like, feels like, heaven, the place. Remember that the most important point, and this is the point, this is the glorious doctrine of the ascension. The most important point is that he is there. Is that our man is in heaven. The dust of the earth now sits on the throne of the universe. Scottish minister said that in the 1800s. God has taken our humanity, our flesh, and he's perfected it, and now he's brought it. He's ascended and he's passed through bringing it into the holy of holies. Why does this matter? This matters because this guarantees our place there. In that place, our and everyone who trusts in him. John Flavel, great Puritan writer, 1600s. Quote, he was, Jesus was the first that entered into heaven directly. First flesh, first from this earth to enter into heaven directly and in his own name. And had he not done so, we would not have entered when we die in his name. The forerunner made a way for all that are coming, end quote. John 17, 24, Jesus father, I desire that they also whom you have given me may be with me where I am to see my glory that you have given me because you love me from before the foundation of the world. And so, yeah, Christian, let not your heart be troubled. Though devils and darkness and dictators and disease and everything else abound, let not your hearts be troubled for a man is on your side and has pierced heaven. Look to Jesus and do not ever look away. A priest in heaven, a spirit poured out, a place prepared. What a glorious salvation, what a glorious ascension I hope you see this morning. One writer said, without the ascent of Christ, Christianity would not exist. You can see a little bit more why that's true this morning. Now, as he departs this earth upon a cloud of glory, now salvation and victory are complete. The work of Christ is finished. But listen, if I could conclude in this way, even this is not the very end. It's the end of Christ's work of salvation. It's it is finished. But even this is not the ultimate end. You see, the ascension in a way is itself a two-part act. It's a finale, as I've tried to show you this morning. But it's also, I want to conclude by showing you, it's a preview. You saw that earlier, even in the angel's words in Acts chapter one. Why do you stand looking? This Jesus who is taken up from you into heaven will come again in the same way. He will come again in the same way as you saw him go into the heavens. Jesus will come again. And the angels say he'll come again just as he departed upon the cloud. Just like the ascension, he'll come again back down as a sequel. Revelation chapter one verse seven says, behold, he is coming with the clouds. This is one of the most glorious or terrifying verses in all the Bible, depending on where you stand. Behold, he is coming with the clouds. There he is again with the clouds. And every eye will see him, even those who pierced him. And all tribes and every tribe of the earth will wail on account of him. Even so, amen. The ascension has a sequel. The only difference is this time it won't just be a handful of disciples in a room in Jerusalem who see him. This time, every eye will see him of every nation. And many we read will wail on account of him. For now, they'll know once and for all just who he is, just who he always will be. And then it'll be too late. But it's not too late for you who are here this morning under the sound of my voice. Today is the day of salvation. You need to only look at Jesus and never look away. Let me pray. God, thank you for the death, the resurrection, and the ascension of Christ, our savior and king. I pray as we leave this morning, every eye and every heart would be drawn to him by your spirit. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
