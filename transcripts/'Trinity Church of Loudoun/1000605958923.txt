I've spoken often over the last few years of my maternal grandma, Ruby MacLam. She died a few years ago, right before we, I think the week before we started the church, actually. I went down and did her funeral. She was a tough, some would say simple, southern lady, and a very godly saint. Very much a sort of spiritual matriarch in our family. And for as long as I knew her, she prayed. She had a sunroom that was just sort of the first thing you entered into the backside of their house. And she was, you know, you roll up into the driveway, she was always in there. You could count on her always being in there. She just lived in that sunroom, and it really was and became a prayer room. And you knew that she prayed because she told you all the time that she prayed, and you knew that she prayed for you because she told you all the time that she prayed for you, and for you, and for you too, and honestly probably some of you, and for this and that, and for everything, every day. She'd say, I pray for you every day, Matt, and I believed her. I knew that she meant it. She knew that I were speaking of her now to you Yankees, and she would absolutely believe that you are all North Carolina Yankees. She would not have believed it, and it would have absolutely tickled her. Her prayer ministry surely included adoration, worship of God, and it surely included confession. She knew that she was a sinner to her dying day. I know that it included Thanksgiving. She had a really hard life, but she was a very thankful lady, even at the end while she was suffering and dying. But above all, it seemed to me that her prayer ministry was chiefly one of intercession. That is, standing in the gap before God and on the behalf of others, me, whoever else was on her mind and on her heart. That's what intercession is. It's three parties. It's God who hears. It's another who God needs to hear prayers on the behalf of, and it's you. It's her, the one crying out and interceding to God. That's what she gave, it seemed to me, most of her time to in prayer, and that's what we find Abraham doing this morning in God's word. In Genesis chapter 18, if you're not already there, we find Abraham interceding, and what's more than that, maybe the most remarkable feature of this passage, is we find God giving to Abraham a very ready audience, and so I want to persuade you this morning to pray. That's it. Nothing new, nothing innovative, nothing you haven't heard before. I want to persuade you to pray this morning and to pray more and to pray more boldly because God hears you, and I want to persuade you a little bit more this morning that God really does hear you. It's a fascinating passage, but I think that's ultimately what it's driving at and why this story of all the different things that Moses skips over in the life of Abraham, why does he include this story? I think, ultimately, this story is given to us to invite us, to embolden us, to encourage us to pray big prayers to God like Abraham prayed, and so I want you to see two things this morning as we'll look at this passage in two parts. First, God hears the cries of injustice. God hears the cries of injustice, and second, I want you to see and I want you to take heart that God hears the prayers of his people. God hears the cries of injustice, and God hears the prayers of his people. God hears, just like we saw in Genesis 16 with Hagar in the wilderness. God sees, Jehovah Rapha, God sees. God also hears. Take heart this morning. Take heart tonight. Take heart tomorrow morning. As you get on your knees once again, God really does hear you. So first, let's look at the God who hears the cries of injustice, and here we'll look at verses 16 through 21, verses 16 through 21. Remember, Abraham has just finished up last week, last passage, he's just finished up a meal with two angels who are appearing in the form of men and the Lord himself. So two angels and the Lord himself, Abraham, is the only man ever to share a meal with God until the Lord Jesus appears on this earth. Think about that. That's last week. The only man ever to share a meal with God until Jesus, and then we read in verse 16 that, then after the meal, after being full, whatever that looks like for angels to be Then the men, who are the angels, set out from there and they looked down toward Sodom. And Abraham went with them to set them on their way. So the men here, the two angels, they set out from Abraham's place and they looked or they went down toward Sodom. Abraham lives up on a high place beneath his trees. Remember, the Oaks of Mamre. And Sodom is down in the valley. That's why it says here that they look down. They're literally physically looking down and they walk away from Abraham's place, looking down toward Sodom and Abraham walks with them. So he's now dine with God. He's now walked with God, just like Adam in the garden. What a friend he has in God. But before they leave, the Lord audibly says in verse 17 to the angels, but so that Abraham can hear, the Lord says, Shall I hide from Abraham what I'm about to do? Now I want you to notice a few things about the conversation that is about to take place. The remarkable, maybe confusing in some ways, conversation that is about to take place here. Remember, God and Abraham are now in covenant with each other. God has cut a covenant. He's entered into a relationship, even a friendship with Abraham. They are God and Abraham. They are friends. They just shared a meal together. And how thick is their friendship? Well God's going to destroy Sodom. But not before letting Abraham know, not even before inviting Abraham into his plans, even into the negotiation of his plans. I know that's so strange. I know that raises all kinds of complex questions. Stay after the service for pizza and a first time ever Q&A about the service, about the sermon, about the passage. I know it's so weird. It raises so many questions. But don't miss the big point. They're friends now. God and Abraham, they're covenant friends. And so God says purposely in front of Abraham to the angels, should I let him know what we're about to do? Like a parent might say something in front of their kids, not to their kids, but in front of their kids so that their kids will hear and draw them out. And I want you to look carefully at verses 18 and 19 because here in these two verses God explains exactly why he invites Abraham into his plans towards Sodom. Verse 18, seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and seeing that all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him, shouldn't I let him know of what I'm about to do? Verse 19 says, for I have chosen him that he may command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord by doing righteousness and justice so that the Lord may bring to Abraham what he has promised to him. Remember, these are the promises of the covenant to Abraham. Do you still remember them? It's been a few weeks since I asked you. Three promises, three big promises in the covenant to Abraham, what are they? People, some of you, some of you still got it, people, place, blessing. God has chosen Abraham to make him into a people to give him a place and to cause him to be a blessing for who? For the whole world, for, God's not just going to bless Abraham and the nation that comes from Abraham, Israel, he's going to, through Abraham, bless all the nations. Well, here, what's happening? God's about to execute a nation, one of those nations that's to be blessed in Abraham. God's about to execute Sodom, to wipe them out from the earth. But Abraham is the man through whom God is going to bless every nation. He's been chosen and set apart for this purpose. In fact, these nations, Sodom and Gomorrah, are the same nations that Abraham, if you remember back in chapter 14, Abraham, remember when he fought those kings and destroyed those kings and returned Lot and all of his bounty and all those possessions back to the people of the valley? That included these people, Sodom and Gomorrah. Abraham's already been a blessing to these people. And now he's back before God, and God seems to want him to negotiate for more. God has given to Abraham a special role, verse 19, he's to keep the way of the Lord. Keep the way of the Lord for the sake of blessing the nations. By the way, if you are a covenant partner of God here this morning, in other words, if you're a Christian and you become a covenant partner of God, with God, by faith in Christ and by faith alone in Christ alone, if you're a covenant partner of God, this is a wonderful job description for you as a covenant partner in verse 19. Command your children and your household after you to keep the way of the Lord by doing righteousness. How's this for a job description? Doing righteousness and justice so that the Lord may bring to Abraham and to all the nations what he has promised to him. Abraham is God's chosen vessel to bless the nations. He's also God's friend now, and so God draws him into his plans to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah. Now, why is God, with these two angels, why is God headed down to destroy the city of Sodom? In chapter 19, the next chapter, which we'll come back to in a few weeks after Easter, we get a full and grotesque picture of the character of the people of Sodom. But before we get there, we're already, I want to show you this morning, we're already given significant clues as to why God's anger and wrath is targeted towards and zoomed in on Sodom here. We're already given significant clues as to why in the Lord's words here. Look at verse 20. Why Sodom? Well here's why. Verse 20, then the Lord said, because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great and their sin is very grave. Verse 21, I will go down, the Lord says, I will go down to see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry that has come to me. And if not, I will know. I want you to notice that word in both of those verses, outcry, because that word is a very important word and idea throughout the story of the Bible, and it's a very significant clue in our passage before we even get to chapter 19 of why God's bull's eye is set upon Sodom. Genesis 4.10, we already read that the Lord said to Cain after he murdered his brother Abel, what have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying out to me. Same word. Crying out to me from the ground. Even all the way, fast forward to the New Testament we recently studied before Genesis, we studied James at the end of James. James says, behold the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud. Those wages which you stole basically, they're crying out against you. And the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts. It's the cry of the oppressed. That's what this crying out is all about. It's the cry of the oppressed. It's the cry of injustice. We associate Sodom with sexual sin, and especially with homosexuality, and rightly so. And again, we'll look in full detail at more of the character of that people in a few weeks. But I want you to see that their sin was so much more than just that one sin. And their guilt had a breath to it. Listen to the prophet Ezekiel looking back on the people of Sodom much later. This is from, you don't have to turn there, but this is from Ezekiel 16, 49 and 50. It says this, behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom. This is God speaking. She and her daughters had, now what do you think he's going to say? Just homosexuality? Wait a second. She and her daughters had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease, but did not aid the poor and the needy. Oh, ouch. They were haughty and did an abomination before me, and so therefore I removed them when I saw it. What was their sin? They were greedy, and they oppressed the poor and the outcast in their greed. We get our first clue to that when we read twice here that their outcries of the people victimized in Sodom went up to God. You know, you and I, we are decent, humane people, aren't we? If I might say so myself. And so when we see and when we hear of injustice being decent and humane people, when we hear the cries of the oppressed, when they catch our ears, it moves us. If we're not dead inside, it moves us. Something in us causes us to act when we hear the outcries of the oppressed, or to give, or to pray. Maybe we roll down the window for the beggar at the intersection. Maybe we try to provide a meal for the hungry. Maybe we stop to check on a child who's crying, and we notice they're crying, and they're all alone. But then we mostly move on, and we mostly keep on going, and we mostly enjoy our lives. And even more than that, we mostly just don't hear those cries, do we? We're mostly sheltered from them. In a few minutes, we're going to enjoy pizza together to the glory of God. And I know that you're all tired of pizza, and it's arguably not that healthy, though I've never, for the record, seen any kind of science on that. But as we enjoy our pizza, and laugh, and complain a little bit in our hearts about unhealthy the passers are, or how cheap they are, and enjoy the Word together a bit more, in just a few moments, simultaneously, thousands of real people, created in the image of God, will cry out their life's final groan, in feeble voices, as they starve to death. I'm really not shaming you about pizza, I'm just making the point, 25,000 people will die today of starvation, 10,000 of those 25,000 will be children. And I'm not suggesting that we're wrong to keep on going, or to eat our pizza, we kind of have to, don't we, to some extent we have to. Many of you work professionally for justice, many of you use your spare time to serve the marginalized, but even you still go home at night and sleep in your bed with the air conditioning on, or the heat on, depending on the season, and you should. The injustices of the world are so deep and so vast, that we just can't stop for them all, and we certainly can't absorb them all. It's completely overwhelming, have you ever felt that? Have you ever tried to stop to care? It's just too much, we're not big enough. God hears them all. Every single cry reaches God's all-hearing ears. God hears the cries of the immigrant, who works harder than everybody in this room, but receives an unfair wage simply because his employer knows that he can get away with it. God hears the cries of the teenage girl, overpowered and defiled by a stranger in the darkness. God hears the cries of the wife, intimidated and silenced by her husband, of the son beaten by his father. God hears the cries of entire nations, starving as those in power make themselves rich and full on the backs of their starving people. All of those cries go up, just imagine how many millions of people, billions of people, how loud that chorus would be, all of those go up, all of them reach God's ears, and he is big enough, and he does care enough to hear them all. The cries of injustice have come up from Sodom. That's what the Lord is saying here, it's bad. They've reached heaven and God has heard them, and God is love, but God is also wrath. Wrath is just the other side of love, the same fierceness which causes love is also that which causes wrath when that which God loves is oppressed or wickedly abused. Both love and wrath are awakened in God by the cries of injustice, and Siri is now awakened on me, I'm going to turn that off. His inflamed eyes are now set for Sodom, but before he goes, he informs his friend what's about to happen, and he invites Abraham to speak. It's critical that you see that God initiated this, God drew Abraham in, he solicited Abraham to have this conversation which is about to happen. God is just, he's just, he's fair, he's right, Abraham knows this, and on this basis, Abraham stands up and speaks. And so secondly, I want to show you God hears the prayers of his people, and let's look here at verses 22 through the end of the passage, in the end of the chapter in verse 33. God hears the prayers of his people, look at verse 22, we read that Abraham, the angels are now departing, they're going for Sodom, but Abraham stood still before the Lord. Verse 23, we read that Abraham didn't just stand still and remain before the Lord, Abraham drew near to God, his friend. What follows is one of the more interesting dialogues in all of scripture, and again, it's recorded for our instruction, and I think even more than that, it's recorded for your and my encouragement. Abraham is interceding here on behalf of the city and on behalf of the people of Sodom. This is intercession, he's standing in the gap between God and on behalf of this wicked people who God's wrath is set upon, he's standing between the two, crying out on behalf of the accused. And even more than that, he's testing out the character of God, his king and his friend, just how righteous is God, just how merciful is God. I want you to notice five things about Abraham's prayers, which are instructive for us all, we all want help in our prayers, we all struggle to pray, we all wanna pray more, we all want to know how to pray, we all want above all to see results when we do pray, don't we? Don't you want to know that God's going to answer you when you pray? Well let's learn here from Father Abraham, five things I want you to notice from Abraham's prayers, I tried my best to get them to alliterate, but I ended up with B's and P's, and I don't know if it's, yeah, probably, by the time I'm in my 40s I'd like to think I could get five things all with one letter starting with the same letter, but until then, I've got B's and P's. So first, I want you to notice the burden of his prayers. The burden of his prayers, I mean by burden, that which captures his heart and causes him to plea with God in the first place. What's Abraham's driving force here, what's in his heart, what's driving his negotiations, what's his burden here? He's definitely concerned, I want to be clear, and this will be really clear in chapter 19, he's definitely concerned for his family member, his nephew Lot. But he pleads, not just for Lot, he pleads, he never names Lot, he pleads for all the righteous in the city, and even more than that, I think we have to say that in total, he pleads for the city and all in it on behalf of the righteous. His prayers here, even if who the face in his mind is his nephew Lot, his prayers here are for the benefit of the entire city, even for the wicked. Abraham is driven to intercede with God by his concern for others. He's been set apart, again, his unique role, covenant head, he's been set apart to be the blessing to every nation, that includes Sodom, and he takes that role very seriously. He's doing here exactly what God has set him apart to do. Now I want to ask you a difficult question. Don't answer aloud, think about it in your heart. If I told you this morning that I have a word from the Lord, I don't other than this, but if I told you that I have a word from the Lord, an extra, a special word from the Lord, announcing, God has told me, announcing the imminent destruction of a wicked city, so all of Vegas is going to be wiped out for its evil. All of D.C. is going to be wiped out for its corruption. All of the entire nation of North Korea is going to be wiped out for its oppression. Whatever it is, whatever your number one, most wanted list, so to speak, whatever your number one, if I had a word from the Lord and announced, God has told me, it's going to be wiped out, what would be your reaction? It's about time? I wonder how many of us? Abraham's reaction, and I want you and me to feel this, his reaction is immediate concern. Immediately a heavy burden falls upon Abraham's heart and moves him to action, daring, I would even say dangerous action with God, which again was exactly God's intention and why God said this for Abraham's ears to hear in the first place. Prayer always begins with a burden. What burdens you? One of the ways to answer that question is what do you pray for? Prayers reveal our burdens. What burdens you? And I'll ask even further. In your prayers, when you pray, is there any regard in your heart revealed by your prayers for the nations, particularly for those nations which have little or no access to the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, by which, apart from which nobody will be saved? You know, as we grow in Christ, as we mature as Christians, our prayers ought to increasingly reflect a burden for the nations. I just thought of this right before I came up this morning, I didn't ask for permission to call him out, but if I could call our brother, one of our pastors, Larry, who prayed for us earlier, I don't know how long you've been a Christian, more than 60 years? More than 50 years? More than 50 years, a long time, longer than most of you have been alive at any rate, sorry, Larry. But longer than 50 years, he's been following the Lord, and one of the things that stands out to me about Larry, there's so many evidences that he reads materials that come out every week and he sends them to me so I can look at them over what's happening in this nation and what's happening, that has nothing to do with America, that has nothing to do with Loudoun County, it's just a sanctified heart growing to care for and burden for the nations. That's what God does in us as we grow in Jesus. He grows in us a burden for those who don't know Jesus, including those people, those nations that have no access to the gospel. What if God means to show mercy to an entire nation, to bring in a way, a gospel revival and awakening to an entire nation where there's currently little or no access? What if he means to do that through the burden of your and our prayers? Notice the burden of Abraham's prayers. Notice the posture of his prayers. The posture of his prayers. Let me show you, we see so many times, I trust you noticed it as the passage was being read for us earlier, but so many times Abraham does the same thing, it's like this reflex before he goes to God. Look at verse 27, Abraham answered and said, behold, I have undertaken to speak to the Lord, I who am but dust and ashes. Then in verse 30, he speaks again, then Abraham said, oh, let not the Lord be angry and I will speak again. Verse 31. He said, behold, I have undertaken to speak to the Lord. Verse 32. One more time. Then he said, Abraham said, oh, let not the Lord be angry and I will speak again. But this once. Do you see the pattern? Do you see his posture? Every time Abraham opens his mouth, he humbles himself before his creator. He knows, he knows that he has no rights here. He knows that everything he has, he only has because God for no reason other than mercy has chosen him. He was just a guy worshiping gods of the moon in a far away place from Israel. Everything he has, he has from God. He knows that God can strike him dead here on the spot. Abraham is in the presence of holiness after all. Listen, you, you, you, let me encourage you. You can cry out to God. You can, you can vent frustrations to God. You're angry at something that's happening in the world. You're angry at God. You actually can make that known without any fear of being struck down. The Psalms are given to us as holy scriptures and some of those prayers are really raw. One of the most frequent refrains in the Psalms is how long, oh Lord. That's not a cry of adoration towards God. How long, oh Lord, what are you doing? You can, you can pray just as raw as the psalmist prays. And let me say further, adding qualifiers, humble lines, I bow before you God. That does not cause your prayers to be answered like God answers to some cheap magic trick here. God's not some vain ruler who can be easily manipulated by us just uttering the right words. But here's the point. God opposes the proud and gives grace to the humble. James 4, 6, Isaiah 66, God almighty speaking, this is the one to whom I will look. He who is of a humble heart and a contrite spirit and who trembles at my word. It's not about the right words. It's not about secret phrases or pass codes that unlock God's generosity. It's about God looks at the heart and God hears the humbled heart. James' words here reflect his heart. He really means what he says. He's not just being self-effacing. He really means and feels what he says and so God hears him. There's a reason Christians across the ages have often kneeled to pray. And I'm not saying you need to kneel or we need to kneel and I'm not saying, again, that's not a secret cheat code either to get God to hear your prayers. But the point is the posture of our hearts and Christians throughout the centuries have often thought, you know what? If the posture of my body reflects humility, maybe my heart will catch up. Let us learn from Abraham's humbled posture and prayer. Third, I want you to notice the boldness of his prayers. The boldness of his prayers. Abraham is praying for the preservation of nothing less than a city. However many hundreds or thousands, tens of thousands, I don't know how big Sodom and Gomorrah were. He's praying for God to in wrath remember mercy. He's praying to, state the obvious, to affect the will of the Almighty. These are big prayers. You know, we try to model to you in our services every Sunday morning, including this one, how to pray. We really are praying. I really am praying. Larry really is praying. Whoever's praying really is praying. But we're also trying to model how to pray, praying for other nations, praying for governments and for those in authority, as the Bible tells us to do, praying for gospel ministries, praying for other churches, including other churches right in our backyard, and of course, praying for our own church and for our own church members, for God to move nations because he can and he has and he will, and praying for God to move our hearts. Listen to Charles Spurgeon. A little quote here to further bolster your encouragement for boldness in prayers. Quote, there is no force in nature that is equal to the power of prayer. The law of gravitation holds the planets in their orbits and links the sun to all the spheres that circle around it. But prayer has now made gravitation itself to cease to exert its energy. Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon, said Joshua, end quote. I am sure that you don't pray big enough prayers, just as sure as I am that I myself don't pray big enough prayers given the God we serve. Spurgeon said elsewhere, you can be omnipotent, that means all powerful, if you know how to pray, omnipotent in all things which glorify God. If somebody else besides Spurgeon said that, there's no, that would, heresy, no way. But do you see what he's saying? You can be, you have access to divinity if you actually pray for his glory. It doesn't mean he's a genie and you get the right words, but if you're after his glory, his name, he can move mountains for the sake of his name. How bold are you in your prayers? Let us learn from Abraham's audacity as he pleads with God. Fourthly, I want you to notice the persistence of his prayers. The persistence of his prayers, 50 to 45, 45 to 40, 40 to 30, 30 to 20, and 20 all the way down to 10. Abraham works patiently, methodically, persistently, he works all the way down. He works God all the way down from 10, or from 50 rather, to 10. Now listen, you can look at this in two ways, right? You can look at this like Abraham's this great negotiator and the Lord is just a sort of sucker, sorry to say that, but the Lord is just a sucker for a really good salesman named Abraham in front of him, and I'm sorry, that's just obviously not the point, that's a totally unfair reading of the Bible. The other way you can look at this is, you can see it for what it is, God is again, drawing Abraham out, drawing him nearer in friendship to his own heart, to his own goodness, to God's own delight in proving himself to be faithful to those who ask. He wants Abraham to know just how good he is. God wants us to ask, friends, and to persist in our asking because he wants us, he wants your friendship, he wants you to rely upon him so he can prove himself to be true. You know, Jesus told a parable to the same effect as this one, one of my favorite parables, the parable of the persistent widow, we read it in Luke chapter 18. The story's simple, there's a poor widow who has no rights and there's a corrupt judge, and this poor widow comes to the corrupt judge and she says, judge, give me mercy. You have the authority, the money, the resources, the power to change my unjust circumstances. The judge ignores her. So what does she do? She goes back, she knocks on his door again, she says, judge, give me mercy yet again. The judge ignores her again, get away from me, you don't deserve an audience before me. So what does she do? She comes back again, and then she comes back again, and then she comes back again until what finally happens? That unjust, wicked, corrupt judge finally gives her exactly what she asked for, why? Because he was annoyed at her. He wanted her to stop beating on his door. Jesus told that parable why? He tells us why he told that parable. He told that parable, Luke says, so that we might pray always and not lose heart in our prayers. You see, God's not like that corrupt judge. He's actually good and benevolent and loves you and even wants to be your friend as you submit to him in Christ. He's perfect, he loves you. He hears your cries. And listen, here's the point, if even corrupt judges can be worn down, you don't think God will hear and answer the prayers of those who keep on asking? Let's learn from Abraham's persistence in his prayers. That brings me fifth, and finally, to the basis. I want you to notice the basis of Abraham's prayers. I'm gonna stop with this fifth observation, and I wanna land the plane here because this is really where I want you to leave with this word from God's holy word in Genesis chapter 18. This is probably the most important thing for you to grasp in Abraham's intercession. The basis for his prayers, the basis for his appeal is found throughout the entire dialogue, but it's stated most clearly in verse 25, if I could draw your eyes to verse 25. Abraham, pleading, bargaining, negotiating with God in prayer, says this, far be it from you, God, to do such a thing. Far be it from you to put the righteous to death with the wicked, so that the righteous fare as the wicked. Far be it from you, God, shall not the judge of all the earth do what is just. Let me just read that for you again, put your eyes upon it. Shall not the judge of the earth do what is just. What's the basis of Abraham's prayers? He's banking his prayers, every chance he's got here, he's resting his plea entirely upon the character of God. He's pleading God's own character to God. He's not saying, God, look at me, I'll do this, I've deserved it. He's saying, God, this is who you are, and he's pleading that back to God. Now listen, I think it's only right to say, I don't think Abraham fully comprehends what he's asking here. He's saying, God, you are just, you are fair, you always do what is right. I think it's important to point out, I don't think Abraham at all fully comprehends what he's asking here. He's not found an argument against God that God has forgotten about it. You know, like, again, a really silly, unfair reading of this passage, like, Abraham's negotiating and then God, all of a sudden, with Abraham's help, remembers, like, oh yeah, I am just, aren't I? Actually, actually, hear me carefully, God could have turned Abraham's argument here against him. Fair, Abraham? Is that what you want? Yes, God, fair. You're sure? You want what's fair, what's just Abraham? Yes, yes, God, I'm sure. Friends, do you know what would happen if God gave to all, Sodom and Gomorrah and you and me, what was fair? Wipe us all out, every last one of us, every last city, for all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. I can assure you, I can assure you, you do not want fair. You want mercy. We require mercy, and so do I. We all require the mercy of God, and that's exactly what God gives to us in the gospel. And that's what Abraham, perhaps unwittingly, taps into here, the justice and the mercy of God. Shall not the judge of the earth do what is just? Yes, is God's answer, and actually, he'll do one better than that. Shall not the judge of the earth do what is just and merciful? What an anchor this is. Life's greatest mysteries, life's hardest questions, abusers who destroy victims their entire lives and get away with it to the end. No vengeance, no justice. Maybe some of you have dealt with that or have family members who have. What's the answer to that? The death of a baby or a small child, where are they? Heaven? The Bible actually doesn't say. People can give answers to this, and there's a good case for answers, and people have written books on this, but the Bible does not clearly answer that question. But do you know what the Bible does say? The judge of the earth will do what's right, always. What an anchor this is for life. There's so many things I don't know the answer to. There's so many things the Bible doesn't give answers to, clear answers to, difficult things. But listen, I am so sure, and you can be too, that for all of eternity, we'll all look back on all that God has done, every decision he's made, every verdict he's ever rendered, and we'll all say together, for the rest of eternity, yes, the judge of the earth has done what is right. Abraham tapped into something here, he struck gold, maybe on accident. He pleaded God's character to God, he interceded, and God heard his intercession. At the end of Ruby's life, my grandma, she was dying. She couldn't drive anymore, she was physically really weak, she struggled to walk. And so she just sat in her sunroom with her gigantic, worn down Bible with all her notes in it, all her prayers written out in it, and she just prayed. And I often think about that from this angle, I think about it from this angle. Our entire world says that in those last years, she was the most useless. We hide people like that, we lock them away. We hide ourselves from people like that, from aging, dying people, because we don't want to look in the face of where we're all going in just a matter of years. But in God's world, in God's kingdom, in God's economy, those last years when all she could do was pray might have been her most fruitful years, her most useful years in service to God's kingdom. What a thought, intercession and those who intercede are the captains on this earth in God's army. Because God hears. In the next chapter of Genesis, fire and sulfur are going to come down from heaven. But a man named Lot, along with his two daughters, escapes the apocalypse. Those two angels who left from Abraham's home in our passage here, those two angels went down to Lot, found him, led him out, they warned him, they helped him, they very much saved him. But listen, what Lot doesn't know, but you know because you have the book, what Lot doesn't know is that in a very real way, he only made it out of that holocaust because there was a man who had the audacity to stand before God and plead Lot's cause until God agreed to it. And listen to me very carefully because I need to tell you one more thing before we close it down this morning. I need to tell you that if you hope to survive the coming judgment against the whole world, which is coming, where God will separate sheep from goat and wheat from chaff and the righteous from the wicked once and for all, if you want to have any chance of surviving that coming holocaust, it will only be because there was another man who had the audacity to stand before God who was his father and plead the cause of sinners. My little children, I am writing to you so that you may not sin. But if you do sin, know this, we have an advocate, it's an intercessor before the father, namely Jesus Christ the righteous, 1 John 2. I want to assure you, if that's you, I want to assure you that Jesus Christ, our advocate, Jesus Christ, our intercessor, his plea before God, his intercession for you had nothing to do with your life and nothing to do with your righteousness. Jesus could not find 50 righteous on the earth to plead with his father. He could not find 45 on the earth. He couldn't find 40 or 30 or 20 or 10 righteous men or women anywhere upon all the earth for all of history. Friends, there wasn't even one who was righteous. And so the son, the eternal son of God, left the riches and glories of heaven to become that righteous man. The one righteous man in the city, even the whole world, he took on flesh, he lived on our behalf, and he became that man. Is anyone worthy? We sing that song. Yes, he is. Just one, only one, he's worthy. And that one gave his life for yours, that you might receive his reward, that his righteousness earned justice for sin and for sinners like you and me, inflicted upon the back of the righteous son of God, just like it was inflicted upon Sodom and Gomorrah, mercy from God, full salvation for you, for me, and for any who will trust in Jesus. Amen? God thank you for the intercession of Abraham and for the example we have in him of one who faithfully intercedes. But God, we thank you even more for the picture that Abraham gives us, the type that Abraham is, of the one to come who would ever live to plead for our cause, the cause of sinners. God awaken faith, adoration, love, thanksgiving in the Lord Jesus Christ. I pray for faith for those who don't yet believe. I pray that you would cause them, even right now, even hearing my words, to cry out in faith for the son of God to take their sins away. And God, we pray that you would encourage us all. In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
