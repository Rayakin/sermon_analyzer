I have two introductions this morning, and one is from the Lord of the Rings, and one is from the Bible, and I couldn't decide between the two introductions, and so I have, I'm just gonna give you two introductions. So first, my introduction from the Lord of the Rings. Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow. Bright blue his jacket, and his boots are yellow. None have ever caught him yet, for Tom, he is the master. His songs are stronger songs, and his feet are faster. That's old Tom Bombadil, announcing himself to Frodo and Sam in the Lord of the Rings. Good chance many of you have never heard of him, even though you've seen the movies, because he didn't make the cut. But listen to his resume, which we get from the books. Tom wanders around the woods, babbling, seemingly nonsensical songs, but his songs set the hobbits free. When Sam and Frodo ask his wife, Goldberry, who is he? She replies, he is, period. He is called the master of wood, water, and hill. He is the eldest, and without father or mother, Tom says that he remembers the first raindrop and the first acorn. And at one point in the story, he asks Frodo, who's at the beginning of his journey carrying this dangerous, powerful ring. At one point in the story, in Tom's house, Tom asks Frodo if he can see the ring. Frodo nervously hands him the ring. Tom, while they wait and watch with bated breath, Tom puts on the ring, which makes every one of its wearers invisible, and which, if you know the story, slowly but surely seduces and ultimately captures its wearer by its power. Tom puts on the ring, gives it a look, stays visible, laughs at it, tosses it up in the air, it disappears, and then he hands it back to Frodo. The ring has power over everybody, everybody apparently, except Tom Bombadil. And yet he's not in any of the movies! What a tragedy! He didn't make the cut. Why? Because he's not, in a way, he's not essential to the story. He doesn't advance the story at all. If you cut him out, you lose nothing in terms of the storyline. Or do you? Now that's enough Lord of the Rings. I'm actually not a ringer. I have no doubt that some of you college students probably are, but I did listen to a three-hour book this weekend on Tom Bombadil, literally just to give you that three-minute introduction. And so if you have any questions about Tom Bombadil, ask me in the next few hours, because I'll surely forget everything after that. Tom Bombadil is what is called an enigma. Tolkien, the author of Lord of the Rings, wrote in a letter, quote, even in a mythical age, like Middle-earth, Lord of the Rings, there must be some enigmas, as there always are. Tom Bombadil is one, end quote. Enigmas stand out. They make no sense when you read about them. They don't fit neatly into the story, at least in the moment as you read them. And that's the point. They're supposed to cause you to stop, pause, go back, and wonder about them. So Frodo, Sam, Mary, Pippin, leaves, trees, Tom Bombadil, more leaves, more forest, more trees. Wait, Tom Bombadil, what? Who is that guy? You see, that's how enigmas are supposed to work in literature, and movie, and life, wherever. Who is that guy? Lord of the Rings. Now, turn with me to Hebrews, introduction number two. If you have a Bible, turn with me to the book of Hebrews towards the back, and then we'll go back to Genesis. We are gonna get to Genesis 14. But I want to show you one more thing by way of introduction, just to sort of set the table before we come to Melchizedek, and this is from the book, the letter written to the Hebrews. So Hebrews chapter 5, and I want you to see something here from the New Testament about this fascinating character who we're about to dive into in Melchizedek. Look at chapter 5, verse 6. I'm just gonna guide you around to a few different verses. Chapter 5, verse 6, the author of Hebrews quotes from Psalm 110, which we already read this morning, and it reads, you are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. Then if you look down at chapter 5, verse 10, the author says, of Jesus, spoiler, you being designated by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek. Now if you look all the way down to chapter 6, verse 20, skipping a lot of verses, an entire chapter in fact, to chapter 6, verse 20, we read that this, of this place where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. Chapter 7, verse 1, for this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him. So watch this. The subject that the author of Hebrews is talking about here is what or who? It's Jesus, but who else? Melchizedek. At the beginning of chapter 5, he's talking about Jesus being a priest after the order of Melchizedek. If you skip ahead to the end of chapter 6 and then all of chapter 7, he's still talking about Jesus being in the order of Melchizedek. Do you see that? So it's one subject, and yet there's a massive gap in between Jesus and Melchizedek and then more Jesus and Melchizedek. Why? Because in the middle of those verses about Jesus and Melchizedek, the author of Hebrews stopped to get something off of his chest, as it were. And let me show you what he wanted to get off of his chest. Look at chapter 5, verses 11 and following. About this we have much to say. About what? About Jesus and Melchizedek. And why you should care about that? About this we have much to say, and it's hard to explain, since some of you have become dull of hearing. Uh-oh. For though by this time you ought to be teachers, some of you, you still need someone to teach you. Again, the basic principles of the oracles of God. You need milk, not solid food. For everyone who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, since he is a child. So just to make sure you're following this, the author of Hebrews in chapters 5 through 7 is talking about Jesus, the great new priest, the ultimate, the final priest in the order of Melchizedek. But he interrupts his own thought to chide you and to chide me, because he's basically saying, I can't even talk about this to all of you, because though you ought to be mature enough to handle this by now, you've been professing to follow Jesus for a long time now, many of you are still drinking milk. You're still spiritually babies. This is solid food from the Word of God this morning, as we come to Melchizedek. This is what the author of Hebrews calls meat. Rich food for adults. It's for the mature, and it's for the maturing. In other words, it's for those who actually want to grow as Christians. God saves the weak, loves the weak, and loves the often stumbling. So do we as a church. Our church is not a church for the mature. You don't have to pass exams to join this church. We are for the weak, and for the doubting, and for young, and old, and the faith, and everybody in between. But we want you to grow, and we're not interested in cultivating lifelong spiritual babies who can only ever drink milk, because God wants more for you than that. And so that's my second introduction, and it's an invitation. Let's grow together this morning. What do you say as we share a little bit of red meat together in the character of Melchizedek? I wonder how many of you have ever heard a sermon on Melchizedek? You're gonna get one this morning. So now you can turn with me to Genesis chapter 14. Some red meat in Melchizedek, and we're gonna pick up, as Tom just read for us, right where we left off last week in Genesis 14. By way of context, remember Abram is the focal point of God's work in the world right now, and Abram has God's promises. Especially, we've looked at three big banner promises that God has placed upon Abram, who's soon to become Abraham. Do you remember what those promises are? Come on. Place, people, blessing. Place, God has promised to give Abram, Genesis chapter 12, a land, the promised land. People, God has promised to take Abram and his wife, who are aged and aging and who are childless, and to turn them into a nation, a vast nation, as vast as the dust in all the earth, if you can count it, if you remember last week. And upon him, Abram, and all who were linked to Abram, he's placed his blessing, which throughout the rest of the Bible, blessing becomes the language of salvation. Place, people, blessing. Those promises are upon Abram. Last week in the story, Abram and 318 men trained in his house rescued Abram's nephew, Lot, who had been captured. Abram rescues him by defeating the four kings led by Keter Laomar, who had just defeated the five kings in the valley. This morning, Abram has made it back home. Back in the promised land with Lot, and now with another massive loot of possessions, which he took back from those kings. And arriving back home, he's met in the story this morning by two characters, two kings, who are total opposites, if you pay attention carefully, in every way, and who offer to Abram a choice. One of them, one of these kings, is probably the most enigmatic character in all of the Bible, the Bible's Tom Bombadil, in the great, the mysterious, the confounding Melchizedek. So we're gonna go on a journey this morning, maybe a bit more like Lord of the Rings after all, and on this journey we're gonna make three stops together. First, we're gonna just do a sort of close-up in Genesis 14 on this strange character of Melchizedek. Second, we're going to just briefly launch out into the rest of the Bible, because I want to show you how Melchizedek, this strange character, just a few verses in Genesis, sort of reverberates, vibrates into the New Testament and kind of throughout the rest of the Bible. And then finally, thirdly, we're gonna return back one last time, just for a moment, to this story of Abram in the Kings Valley in Genesis 14, and we're gonna look more carefully at this choice that he faces, because it's a choice which we all face. So first, a closer look at Melchizedek from Genesis 14. I hope you have your Bible open there to Genesis 14, and I want you to see four things about Melchizedek from Genesis 14. Four things. Number one, his titles. His titles. Look at verse 18, where we read that Melchizedek is called Melchizedek, king of Salem. Now we've seen already in Genesis, again and again and again, that names and places carry massive symbolic weight just in themselves. That's part of how the story is told, how Moses tells the story. Names are given to help tell the story. So think about just characters and places we've met so far. Adam means man. He's the first man that God creates and puts into the garden. His wife is called Eve. Why? Because Genesis 3.24 says, she will be the mother of all the living. Eve means living or life. They're put together in a place, a garden called Eden. Eden means paradise or delight. What's that garden like? It's a paradise. It's a delight to the eyes and everything you can imagine. Noah means rest. Why? Because Noah's father, when he prophesied over him at his birth, said, this one, this son of mine, he shall give us rest from our toil. Genesis 5.29. Abel means breath or vapor. So some of you know the book of Ecclesiastes, the word it says again and again and again. Vapor, vapor, vapor, vanity of vanities. The word there is Hebel, Abel. Why? Because Abel's like a vapor, like a mist. He's here and then he's gone just like that because his brother took his life. Babel means confusion. Think of the word we even carry into our English language. Babel. It sounds like confusion. Why? Because there God confused the language of the people and on and on and on the story goes. Names have meaning. God assigns them and uses them to tell His story, which brings us to Melchizedek. His name is the combination of two titles and oh boy are they two big titles. Melech, in Hebrew consonants are how you form words. So MLK means, I just realized that was Martin Luther King, MLK in Hebrew means King. Tzedek or Tzadek in Hebrew means righteousness. So you put them together. His name literally means King of Righteousness. Melchizedek, King of Righteousness. But that's not the only name or title that we're given that's associated with Melchizedek. He is Melchizedek, King of Righteousness, but we also read in verse 18 that he's the King of Salem. Salem is another really important name or title. It means, anybody know what Salem means? It means peace. Shalom is this word. Salem. So Jewish people, Hebrew people to this day greet each other with that phrase. Shalom. Why? They're saying peace to you, peace be upon you, and peace upon you. Shalom. And actually Salem in the Bible, it doesn't just mean peace. This, King of Salem, was a real place and it's a really important place. It most often in the Bible goes by its longer form name Jerusalem. In Hebrew the word for city is Yer and Salem means peace. So Jerusalem, Yerusalem, means city of peace. So put these two titles together, what do you have? Melchizedek is introduced. Just imagine little Jewish boys and girls gathered around campfire, mom and dad are reading the Bible to them like good Jewish parents, and they get to Genesis 14. What are their little ears here? And then came out to meet Abram, the King of Righteousness, who is also the King of Peace. How awesome would that be to your little ears wherever you come from. Insane titles. King of Righteousness and King of Peace. Who is this man? Secondly, I want you to look at his offices. Melchizedek's offices. Verse 18, let me just fill in some more here. He is the King, as we just saw, the King of Salem. But then we read in a parenthesis that he was also a priest of the Most High God or of God Most High. Kings and priests, as you know if you're familiar with the Bible, are absolutely critical offices in all of the Bible, in all of Scripture. You can't understand much of your Bible if you don't grasp these two offices of King and priest. In fact, I would go even further, you can't fully appreciate the gospel of the Lord Jesus if you don't appreciate and have some understanding of these two offices in the Bible of King and priest. Genesis 14, our passage this morning, is the first time in the Bible that both words show up. King and priest. Those are huge titles, words in all the Bible. Here we encounter these words, these offices, for the very first time. And if I could just simplify a whole lot that the Bible says in one line, that may be the simplest way to think about it. Kings and priests. Kings rule and priests cleanse. Kings rule, they reign, they exercise power, and priests are set apart to cleanse or to keep us clean. Now hang with me here because it's a little bit of a detour, but it's really important. I think, and if you were here almost a year ago when I was actually preaching through the beginning of Genesis, I know many of you weren't, but I think that Adam in the garden is clearly shown by Genesis to be a king and a priest. He's described in language that later in the Bible is only ever used of kings and priests. He's told to rule over the garden, he's to conquer and to subdue. He's also told to protect the land, in other words, to keep it clean like a priest would. Now spoiler, as you know, he failed at both. So instead of conquering like a king should conquer, he was himself conquered by the serpent, so he gave up his crown. And instead of banishing that filthy serpent which was intruding this clean garden, he actually joined in its rebellion. He himself became unclean and so he also forfeited, he gave up his priestly robes. After that, this is critical, after that never again in the story of Israel are kings and priests joined together as one. Never again. It was forbidden in fact. Priests were to come from the tribe of Levi who came from Aaron, which God set apart for this sacred task of being priests, of making sacrifices, of cleansing. They were never to touch the crown. Priests could not go near the throne, but kings were not to touch the altar. Kings could not make sacrifices. Twice in the story of the Bible, that boundary, priests, kings, they must not come together, together twice in the story of the Bible that boundary was transgressed. First King Saul, you might remember. First Samuel 13. Israel's at war with the Philistines and on the brink of defeat under Saul's command, Saul in desperation calls for Samuel, that Samuel is God's priest who just earlier had anointed Saul as king and he calls for Samuel to, hey come please come help us make an offering to God that he might, sort of a good luck charm that Saul is calling for and he waits and he waits for one day, for two days and for an entire week, seven days Samuel doesn't show and so Saul grows impatient, decides to go into and make the burnt offering himself and then Samuel arrives. Asks what's going on, Saul tells him what he just did, he just he just made an offering and listen to what first Samuel 13 says, and Samuel said to Saul, you fool, you have not kept the command of the Lord your God with which he commanded you, for then the Lord would have established your kingdom over Israel forever, but now your kingdom shall not continue. Do you see what just happened? Saul, the king, transgressed that boundary and he made an offering to appease God, forbidden work for a king and in that moment, that very hour, his kingdom had an expiration date on it. It was coming to an end. Once more, later in the story, hundreds of years later, the same boundary was transgressed. King Uzziah, one of Israel's greatest kings reigned 52 years, beloved by the people, he's one of the good guys in really dark days. In 2nd Chronicles 26, we read that this happened, but when he was strong, in the Bible, when he's strong, when he grew wealthy, those are foreboding words, ominous words. When he was strong, he grew proud to his destruction, for he was unfaithful to the Lord his God. How? He entered into the temple of the Lord to burn incense on the altar of incense, but watch this sort of amazing rescue here. Azariah, the priest, went in after him with 80 priests of the Lord who were men of valor. They run in after him to stop him from doing this and they withstood King Uzziah and said to him, no, it is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the Lord, but for the priests, the sons of Aaron, who were consecrated to burn incense. Go out of the sanctuary. Get out of here. You have done wrong and it will bring you no honor from the Lord. How did Uzziah respond? He got angry. He's the king after all. He's been reigning for 52 years. These priests are gonna tell him what to do. He burned the incense anyway and the moment he burned it, God struck him with leprosy and he lived alone as a pariah with leprosy for the rest of his life. This was a sacred division between kings and priests, as serious as anything in Israel. To transgress it was death. And why? Because no man was worthy of carrying both of those offices. It's sort of like why we have three branches in our government, checks and balances. It's sort of like why I'm not also the chair of our finance committee. There's no verse in the Bible that says the lead pastor can't be the chairman or the deacon of the finance. It's just obviously unwise, right? Only this is here. The stakes are way higher with kings and priests. No man could bear both offices. God forbade it. And yet, here is this strange man with strange names, long before Israel is a nation with kings or priests, who's not even really, if you think about it, he doesn't really fit into this story of Abram and Israel that we're reading about in Genesis. And yet he's introduced to us here as a king of Salem and as a priest of the Most High God. He is a priest who is also a king like Adam was. Who is this man? Thirdly, I want you to look and notice in Genesis 14 his greatness. His greatness. His titles, which we've already looked at, already suggest his greatness. But notice the interactions in this story between Melchizedek and Abram. First, notice who blesses who. Melchizedek blesses Abram. Verse 19, And Melchizedek blessed him, blessed Abram, and said to him, Three times in these just short verses, we read that Melchizedek offered a blessing to Abram. He blesses Abram. He blesses Abram's God, who has delivered Abram from kings and from armies. And here's the point. When a blessing is given in the Bible from one human to another, the blessing always comes from the superior. So in the story of Genesis, how many times do we read that a father blesses a son? Not the other way around. Why? Because the father's the superior. Blessings flow downward. They go from superiors to inferiors to subordinates. And here, Melchizedek is blessing Abram. One more thing I want you to see. Secondly, Abram pays tithes to Melchizedek. Verse 20, And Abram gave to Melchizedek a tenth of everything. Again, I just don't want you to miss the simple point. You pay tithes to who? You pay tithes to one who is greater. Israel gave tithes to God, and Israel later would be told to give tithes, pay tithes to God's priest as God appointed. And here, tithes flow upward. If you want to, blessings flow downward, tithes flow upward. And here, Abram pays tithes to Melchizedek. Now you need to appreciate this point. Abram has just defeated four kings who themselves had just wiped out the five kings in the valley. So nine kings. Abram is the tenth here, if you will, and he's ruling over them. We might even say that Abram here is presented as king of kings. Abram is soon going to become Abraham, the great Abraham, the father of the faith, when the Apostle Paul, writing probably the greatest letter ever written in Romans, wants to illustrate for you and for me how faith actually works, when he wants to illustrate that from a character in the story of the Bible, of all the people he could choose, you know, of Seth, of Enoch, of Moses, of Noah, of David, and on and on, of all the people he could choose. He chooses Abraham, father Abraham. When I was a kid, we used to sing this song in Sunday school. I bet some of you sing it too. It went like this, Father Abraham had many sons and many sons had Father Abraham. Why are you laughing? The joke's on you. Dirty little Gentile kids like us, thousands of years later, singing about Father Abraham. How great is Abraham? He, in a way, towers over everybody else in the story. I think he towers over David. I think he towers over Noah. I think he towers over Moses. He is the man of faith. And here, before this shadowy figure from Salem, Abram essentially bows down. Abram is clearly standing before his superior. Who is this man? One more thing, lastly, fourthly, I want you to notice in these few verses from Genesis 14, his ancestry. Where did he come from? His ancestry. One final thing I want you to see about Melchizedek in this brief encounter is something not outright said, actually, but something really loud and significant in the silence. You see, everybody in the story of Genesis, you know this if you've been tracking along with us in Genesis, everybody we meet in Genesis who is part of this story, everybody who matters at all, is rooted, anchored in a genealogy. That's why we keep getting these weird, long, and such-and-such fathered such-and-such, and then he fathered such-and-such, and he lived this long, and then he died. And so everybody in Genesis is anchored into this story of fatherhood and also of death, because that's what genealogies show us. They live, and they're born son of this person, and then they die. So you need some sort of ID, and so do I, to do most things in our world. You've got to be a citizen of somewhere, and their government has to, in some sense, vouch for you in the form of an ID. Otherwise, you can't own things. Otherwise, you can't get into places. Otherwise, you can't qualify for insurance, and on and on we go. Well, in Genesis, genealogies are like your ID, like your card, your pass. They locate you. They legitimize you. Without them, well, you basically don't exist. You might as well not be real. It's like you're not even bound up in this story of sin and this story of death. And yet, here is Melchizedek. He's not related to Abram or to Abram's people, and yet, somehow, he worships Abram's God. He calls out to the same God Abram calls out. How is that possible? Somebody, somehow, made him a priest to Abram's God. How did that happen? In fact, so far as we know in the story, he's not related to anybody. We have no idea where this guy came from. He's unrooted and unanchored. Who is this man, bearing such lofty titles, King of Righteousness, King of Peace, holding offices simultaneously forbidden to any mere mortal since Adam, superior by far to great father Abram, and as the story goes, without father, without mother, without genealogy. Three verses, and that's it. Poof. He's gone forever in the story of Genesis and in all of Moses' book. Adam, Eve, Cain, Abel, Seth, Abram, Melchizedek, Abraham, David, Melchizedek. You see? Enigma. It's the ultimate enigma in the Bible. Melchizedek. Who is this guy? Now, that's the first leg of our journey, but we've got two stops to go. That's the sort of groundwork which is gonna help us to get to where the Bible, where God wants us to ultimately get to. And so, for the second leg of the journey, I want to show you, just briefly, how this bizarre guy that we just met echoes into the rest of your Bible. And I'm just going to show you two brief glimpses. First, we've already read this morning. You don't have to turn there unless you'd like to. But hundreds of years later, after Genesis 14, hundreds of years later, King David conquered Melchizedek's city, Salem. And Jerusalem became King David and the kingdom of Israel's capital. And from Jerusalem, and from the very throne from which Melchizedek once ruled, David, who was a king, which means he cannot be a what? So, he's a king. He can't be a priest. And from Jerusalem, from the throne of Melchizedek, David prophesied that one day, a king was coming and this king is going to crush all of God's enemies. But he says further, and I still can't believe he said this, can you believe he said this? That this king who will crush all of God's enemies will also be a priest after the order of Melchizedek. Can you see, can you believe David just said that? What's going on here? Is David going the same way as Saul before him? He's going to try to blur the two offices together? No, David said that this king would pick up an ancient forgotten priesthood, the priesthood of Melchizedek, when priests were kings and when kings were priests. You are a priest, David writes in Psalm 110, you are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. That's David's prophecy. And that psalm, by the way, Psalm 110, is the most quoted psalm in the entire New Testament. You don't think this matters? You don't think this weird, bizarre character of Melchizedek massively matters to you and me who love the New Testament and the new covenant and the gospel it reveals? Second glimpse, this one in Hebrews 7, and you can actually go ahead and turn there because we're going to be there for a minute. So Hebrews 7, I know flip-flop back and forth to the beginning and the end, kind of awesome. But Hebrews chapter 7, by the way, quick plug, I encourage you, this is not to shame anybody, and don't look around and shame anybody, and I didn't see anybody, I just thought of this. I encourage you, if you have a Bible, to actually bring your physical copy of the scripture to the services. I know we got phones and all, but I encourage you to actually bring your Bible. We flip around a lot, and part of why I encourage you to do that is because I think one small thing, one of many things you're doing here when we study the Bible together, is you're learning yourself, you're training yourself how to do this on your own and how to get familiar with this book and how to eat it up in your own time in addition to as we're here together. And so Hebrews chapter 7, and boy what a chapter this is. Mysteries are revealed, shadows become substance, seeds here germinating for a long time, bud into flowers. Hebrews chapter 7, let me just give you a taste of Hebrews chapter 7, beginning in verse 1. For this Melchizedek, the author says, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, he met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him. And to him Abraham appointed a tenth part of everything. He, Melchizedek, is first, by translation of his name, king of righteousness. And then he is also king of Salem, that is, king of peace. He is without father or mother or genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God, Jesus. He continues as a priest forever. Now just pause there for just a moment. Do you see that the author of Hebrews is just walking line by line through those three verses about Melchizedek in Genesis 14? Everything that he just said is what I just showed you in Genesis 14. That's all, he's just walking through the text. Do you see that? Just like we're trying to do this morning, that's what Hebrews is doing. Now some of you are going to ask, and so I'm going to answer. I'm just going to go ahead and kind of jump to the end of some sorts of things, and then we'll go back. I could be wrong, but I think Melchizedek was a man. I don't mean a man as opposed to a woman. I mean a man as opposed to something else greater than a man. I think he was a very great man, but I think he was just a man. I actually think he did have a mom and a dad. Many have wondered who he was, just like Tom Bombadil. Lots of people, lots of Christians throughout church history have thought he was an angel. Lots of Christians have thought he was Jesus appearing on this earth as a sort of pre-Bethlehem appearance, what people call a Christophany, an appearance of Christ before the manger. That's possible. I think all those options are possible, but I think not, not least because Hebrews 7.3, which we just read, says that Melchizedek resembles the Son of God. Resembling something is a lot different from being something. Existing as something. He resembles the Son of God, and further I think that because this is exactly how the book of Genesis works. Moses crafts his story in very careful, artful ways, including providing an enigma like Melchizedek, who's supposed to cause you to stop and slow down and pause and wonder, like we just did, who is this man? And Moses enshrouds him in mystery, I think, to create this sort of awkward stop in the story because Moses wants to use him to paint a picture of what's coming. Another picture of the one about whom his entire book is about. The one who will come from the woman and crush the seed of the serpent and abolish evil forever and make everything right and restore Eden once and for all. That's what Moses's entire book is about. I think Melchizedek is a bizarre, enigmatic signpost pointing forward to him. That's what Hebrews seems to think. And yet let's continue, verse 4 of Hebrews 7. See how great this man was, to whom Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth of the spoils. Let's skip ahead to verse 6, but this man, Melchizedek, does not have his descent, or sorry, this man, now he's talking, speaking of Jesus, does not, who does not have his descent, I'm sorry, he is speaking of Melchizedek, it's confusing because he keeps flip-flopping back and forth between Jesus and Melchizedek, and I'm sorry, I also have sin and error in myself, you're not the only one, but this man, who does not have his descent from them, received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises. Verse 7, it is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior. In the one case, tithes are received by mortal men. He's talking about Israelites paying tithes to the Levites, who were the future priests after Abraham. But in another case, in the case of Melchizedek and his priesthood, by one of whom it is testified that he lives. Now again, that's just everything we've seen in Genesis 14. But the author of Hebrews is walking through Genesis 14 to show you who Jesus is and what his ministry is like for you. What's it like? What's Jesus like for you who believe in Jesus? It's like Melchizedek, he says. Chapter 5 verses 9 and 10, and being made perfect, Jesus became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him. Being designated by God, Jesus was a high priest after the order of Melchizedek, where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. He keeps making the same point again and again. Chapter 6 verse 20, where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. Who is Jesus? He's the great high priest. What's he like? He's like Melchizedek. He's king and he's priest. Melchizedek all along was a picture and a pointer to the greater one who was coming in the Lord Jesus Christ, who would come and sit on a throne and rule over all God's enemies like a king, but who would also enter into the holy of holies before God himself, offering sacrifices to cleanse us from our sins. His sacrifice was his own body. That's the story of the gospel, isn't it? The lamb of God offering up his very body for our sins as a priest, as the priest, and yet somehow even in death, ruling over all of God's enemies, defeating death, rising from the dead, now reigning forever from the throne, king, priest, and king. If you're here this morning and you've not yet turned and entrusted your life to Jesus, you need, the Bible teaches clearly, you need to first repent that means to whatever direction you're walking in, you need to turn around and walk in the other way because the direction you've been walking in is a direction of rebellion against God, and repentance is what you do before a king who you've defied. But you also, the Bible is clear, you need to, you need to believe. You need to believe in the one whose sacrifice of his own body alone can atone for the sins of anyone who trusts in him, even in yours. You need to believe in him because he's a priest. Repent and believe in the priest king after the order of Melchizedek. Now let me ask a really important question, which maybe some of you have been asking for the entirety of this sermon so far. Why should you care? You're working 60 hours a week trying to make it. You're a stay-at-home mom changing diapers and cleaning your kitchen literally five times a day. You're fighting lust. You're fighting with your spouse and your marriage. Honestly, it's not that great. People don't know it, but it's not that great. Why should you and me and all of us and wherever we fit into the mess of life, why should we care that Jesus represents an eternal priest of the ancient order of Melchizedek, priest and king? Maybe there's a good reason after all that probably most of us have never heard a sermon on Melchizedek. I'm going to give you two ways that this glorious truth of Jesus being like Melchizedek, two ways that this is meant to collide with your life wherever your life is at the moment. The first way is from Hebrews and the other way is from Genesis. The first way is a word of hope for all of you and encouragement. The second is a word of warning. And if I could just summarize the two things I'm about to say with two words, it'd be this, hope and decide. How is this supposed to collide with your life? What's the application here? I'm going to give you two. Hope, number one, hope from Hebrews, number two, decide from Genesis. So first from Hebrews, hang on to hope and keep going. Here's the message for those of you who profess to follow Jesus and you want to know in the middle of life and the suffering of life and the trials of life and the chaos of life, why should I care about Melchizedek? Here's the first reason, hang on, here's what Hebrews wants you to see from Melchizedek, hang on to hope and keep on going. Why does the author of Hebrews all these years later, Melchizedek was forgotten. Why does he bring him up again and why does he want to tell you about Melchizedek? Because he wants you to keep on hoping and keep on going as you walk through this life. When talking about Jesus and when talking about Melchizedek, the author of Hebrews keeps using the same word again and again and again and the word is better. In Christ we have better covenant, 7 verse 22. In Christ we have better promises, chapter 8 verse 16. And in Christ we have better hope, better hope, chapter 7 verse 19. Can you imagine, just for a moment, imagine waking up every morning not only having to change diapers and go to work, you've got to try every single morning to make yourself right with God once again for last night's sins, for this morning's sins. Can you imagine hoping up to the very end of your life that you were hopefully good enough to make it to the good place and not have to go to the bad place? Can you imagine the forgiveness of your sins, your very real sins, which are an offense to God? Can you imagine the forgiveness of your sins hanging upon the blood of bulls and goats offered by the dirty hands of a priest who was, though he's better than you, he's still just a man, he still got sins of his own. Who in the world ever thought that that, the blood of bulls and goats offered by priests, could actually atone for sins if God, who's offended by our sins, is real? Who thought that would ever work? Pagan people all over the world think that this sacrifice is a thing throughout the history of the world, across all kinds of religions, even up to the present day. If God is real and he's really the God of the universe, the God of the Bible, and if he really is a just God who knows our hearts and the wickedness of our hearts, how could that possibly work? That doesn't even make sense. Bulls and goats for our sins? And yet that's how billions of people live their lives to this day and every day around the world. And that is one kind of hope. It's the only hope most people have, whatever religion that goes by. But better hope, Hebrews says, the gospel brings better promises. Because of better promises arriving in a better covenant built on the blood not of goats and bulls, but on the blood of the eternal word of God who has made flesh. God himself coming into our world, reigning eternally at the right hand of the Father, offering up his own eternal perfect soul in the place of our sins. You think that'll work? You're gonna die. And between now and whenever you die, whether it's really soon or decades from now, between now and then, you're gonna fall down, you're gonna screw up, you're gonna do that a lot. I'm not prophesying based on something I know about you. I just know it's true of you and I know it's true of me. And you and I can anchor ourselves into the flimsy ground of ourselves being a pretty good person. Or that maybe our last day will be a really good day and so we're gonna meet the judge right before we had a really good perfect day, you know? We're gonna meet the a really good perfect day, you know? Or you can anchor yourself into the bedrock promises of the gospel from the wonderful ministry of Jesus from the order of Melchizedek, priest and king. So hang on. Keep on hoping the best promises ever made in the history of the world are yours in Jesus if you're united to Jesus by faith. Hold fast to the hope set before you. Jesus, priest and king from the order of Melchizedek will never deny you if you'll hope in him. And keep on going one day and one step at a time by faith. Second final reason why you should care is from Genesis. And this is what I mean when I say decide. And so if you'll go back to Genesis one last time, I know back and forth and back and forth and back and forth, but this is indeed the last leg of our journey this morning. Back to Genesis 14. If one mistake that's been made a lot is to just skim over and skip over Melchizedek and ignore all the glories and all the riches there, another mistake that I could easily do this morning and so far I have done is to just fly by Abram and the actual story here and the choice he faces. Remember Abram has two kings before him and Abram has to decide between the two of these kings. He has the king of Sodom before him offering to Abram all the goods and all the wealth of Sodom which Abram just recaptured from the kings. And friends remember the story of Lot. This is a massive loot. Abram's already wealthy. Now he's going to be Elon Musk wealthy, right? This is a massive offering from the king of Sodom. And then there's Melchizedek, the other king, the king of Salem, offering to Abram bread and wine and a blessing. Words. Words or wealth is the choice that Abram faces here. Abram, if you look at these verses, chooses words and the blessing of Melchizedek and refuses to take a penny from the king of Sodom. It's another step in this journey of faith that we're tracking with Abram. You see this choice and this is why I want to end here, this choice in this story that Abram really faced is the same choice that we all have to make in this life and really we have to make this choice every day of our lives. You can have riches, fame, power, comfort, and you can live your life entirely for yourself or for your family, your children, and still say grace before your meals and tell yourselves that you just grasp for all of that and make that everything in the name of Jesus or you can have Jesus. That's what it means to be a Christian, to have Him, Jesus, as your heart's greatest treasure. It's like the man, Jesus says, who found a treasure and so he went and buried it in a field and then he sold all of his other possessions and he bought that field. Why? Because that treasure that he discovered, nobody else knew it, but what he knew is that that treasure was everything and having that treasure meant that he had everything. School, sports, work, money, family, kids, Jesus, everything. That's what it's like to find Jesus and that's what it means to be a Christian. You can be rich or poor or middle class, that's not the point. You can be a stay-at-home mom or lawyer or janitor or pastor, that's not the point. You can love your family, delight in your kids, that's not the point and you should, I should, but you can only have one treasure. The heart only has room after all for one ultimate love and I'm telling you it's Jesus or it's anything else and if it's anything else, it's not Jesus and so what will you give your heart to? It's just like Abram, the choice we all face. God, we pray that you would, by your Holy Spirit, stir up in us not guilt or shame which never lasts and never bears long-lasting fruit. We pray that you would, by your Spirit, stir up in our hearts love and affection for Jesus and for all that he is for us forever, our priest and our king and God, we pray that you would cause us to see him even more today, even more today, a little more today and a little more tomorrow as our hearts and our life's greatest treasure. Cause us to treasure him in such a way that it causes us to treasure other things in the right way and to steward them even better for your glory, children, money, work, time, everything else. God, we pray you would do all these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
