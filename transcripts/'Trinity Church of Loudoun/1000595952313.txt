More than 4,000 people have successfully climbed Mount Everest and made it all the way to the peak, the summit. Unbelievable. I mean, that's a really small number if you think about what a worldwide and how long we have been trying to do such thing. And yet a really large number when you think about it from the perspective of, wow, 4,000 people have done that insane task. But only two have ever done it blind. The first to accomplish that feat was Eric Weinmayer, who as a baby was diagnosed with a rare disease which eventually took away all of his sight, which did not stop him from, in 2001, climbing and making it successfully to the peak of Mount Everest. He's also one of only 250 people in all of the world, as far as we know, ever to have climbed the seven summits. That's the seven highest mountains from the seven continents, all seven continents. He's also scaled El Capitan in Yosemite. He's also kayaked the 277 miles of the Grand Canyon, considered one of the most dangerous whitewater adventures in the world. Turn with me to Genesis 13 if you're not already there in your Bible. By the way, we have new and updated and refreshed Genesis journals in the back on the bookstall in the lobby for those of you who like to sort of log our journeys through the Bible together. We had the original ones for Genesis 1 through 11. Evan, our dear brother, has revamped them for the rest of Genesis. So make sure to pick one of those up on your way out. You do have to pay for them. They are $75 a piece. And they're like, I don't know how much they cost. They're $4 or $5 or something like that, maybe $6. But pick one of those up if you want to log our time in Genesis. Genesis has turned from God's work in the creation of the world, the universe. It's turned from a cosmic scale to now where we are in Genesis. It's concentrated, focused upon God's work in and upon one particular man. The man called Abraham who we now still know as Abram. He is God's man in this world that has been wrecked and spoiled by sin. God is now reworking to reclaim the creation through one man called Abram. God has made promises and set them upon Abram. If you're going to remember, you've got to remember this. I'm going to keep saying it. Promises for place, people, and can you do the third one? Some of you got it. Blessing. Place, people, blessing. He's promised Genesis 12. It's Mount Everest, so to speak, in the book of Genesis. He has promised to this man, Abram, to give him a place, the promised land, a blessed land. He's promised to take him, Abram, a childless, older man now, 75 years old when God calls him, and turn him into a nation and is going to become a great nation of people. And upon him and upon all his descendants, God has promised to place his blessing. That's the language of salvation. So place, people, and blessing. In last week's passage, Abram was tested, if you were here, and he failed. He fled to Egypt at the first sight of famine, and he fled for refuge, and nearly lost his wife and his life on account of his failure. But now, by the mercies of God, he's made it back into the promised land. And this morning, in the passage that Josiah just read for us, more tests have come to Abram. And what Moses is showing us this morning, and really in this section of Genesis, is that slowly but surely, Abram's learning to trust God. And slowly but surely, Abram's learning what it means to live a life by faith. So the main thing I want to show you, the main idea we're going to see this morning from these two chapters, or most of these two chapters, is this. Through conflict and war, Abram is learning what it means to walk by faith and not by sight. Let me say that again. Through conflict and war, Abram is learning what it means to walk by faith and not by sight. So we're going to look at two different stories this morning, two more adventures in this saga of Abraham. And I want to treat them together because, though in some ways they're sort of like opposites, these two stories that we're looking at this morning, I think Moses is using them side by side to show us the same thing. And the same thing is Abram growing in his faith. So the first episode we'll look at, chapter 13, is Abram makes peace. And the second episode we'll look at, in chapter 14, is Abram makes war. Abram makes peace and Abram makes war, opposites in very obvious ways, and yet both illustrate for us Abram's growing faith in God. So let's look at these two stories together. Episode number one, Abram makes peace. Abram is safely, for now, back in the promised land. And he's richer, we read, than he was even richer before. And he wasn't poor before. You look at verse 2 of chapter 13. We read that Abram was very rich. Very rich. Remember his devilish little trick to pawn off his wife to Pharaoh had secured for him, in spite of himself, a bountiful loot from Pharaoh's palace of donkeys and camels and she-camels and she-donkeys, which for Moses is a big deal. God is blessing, we saw last week, blessing Abram in spite of his own foolishness. Now we find out, and we're going to find out even more in a few chapters, that those blessings weren't all blessings. More money, more problems, right? As Abram's riches, we discover, were both blessing and a curse, as, by the way, is often the case, though we refuse to believe it or care. And so we so often make our lives about money, come what may. Abram and his nephew Lot are now so wealthy that their possessions are so many that the land that they've been settled in, the promised land, their little slice of the promised land, could no longer support them both. And so we read there's steady and mounting conflict and strife between the two camps, the camps of Abram and the camps of his nephew Lot, and things are about to explode. We all fall into that trap, don't we, thinking that money will solve our problems. When what it really tends to do, if you think about it, what it really tends to do in our sinful hands and with our sinful hearts is to solve one problem while it creates a new problem. Think about it. It fills our bellies with good food, solving that problem, but then it ignites pride and selfishness in our hearts, creating a whole host of new problems. It gives us the home of our dreams. That's a good thing, shelter, roof, and room to spare. But it leads to strife and conflict with our loved ones. It's like a game of whack-a-mole often, where money helps you to put down one mole, and then another one pops up his head even as a result. So Abram here looks to settle the conflict that their money and wealth has created before it gets out of hand. He does so by giving to Lot his choice, Lot's choice of the land. He says, Pick, choose whatever you want. There's no trick here. And I'll take the other one. And Lot agrees to Abram's offer. Who wouldn't agree to this? Now, I want us to settle here for a moment and appreciate the actions and words of Abram and think about our own lives. The point of this passage is not how to be a peacemaker like Abram. But surely there's much we can learn from Abram's peacemaking. Abram's herd is about to go to war with Lot's herd. Now, Abram outranks Lot as his uncle and as the older man. And this is a culture where, as a result, he gets first pickings every time. Abram has all the rights here. Lot has none. Abram, furthermore, is God's chosen instrument. The blessing of God to the world is coming to Abram, not Lot. The land has been, this land they're in and overcrowding has been promised to Abram by the very voice of God, not Lot. And yet, Abram lays aside all of his rights and defers to Lot. Why? For peace. All of us deal with conflict. It's a regular part of life. You can't get through life without it. You can try to run away from conflict, and lots of us do, and we'll just run our way and find our way to new conflicts with new people. I feel like the conversation that I'm most regularly having with my kids right now is the conversation about learning to think about others and not just ourselves, and especially learning how to think about our sisters. Or how about considering others even at all? So I've started, I don't know where I first got it from. I'm sure you've heard it before, cheesy little saying, and now I say it all the time like it's in the Bible. God first, others second, me third. My kids are now repeating that. You can steal that if you like. You can test it and see if you think it's biblical or not. God first, others second, me third. Of course, mom and dad's little secret is that we ourselves haven't yet learned that lesson entirely, have we? Have you? How much of our conflict in the home, in marriage, at work, with total strangers, how many of our conflicts boil down to this one thing, considering ourselves and our own needs and desires more than those of others? Abram is a wonderful model to us here of peacemaking. And even more than that, he's a wonderful model to us of the Lord Jesus himself, who laid aside his own rights, Paul writes in Philippians 2, laid aside, gave up for a season, his own status as the glorified one at the right hand of the Father in heaven and took on the form of a servant for our good and for our salvation and so has made peace between sinners and God. Look at verse 10. So what happens as a result of Abram's offer of peacemaking? Look at verse 10. This was before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. He took the cities of the valley and moved his tent as far as Sodom. Now the men of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the Lord. I recently got this insane deal. I just thought of this. This could be a terrible illustration. We'll see how it goes. I recently got this insane deal where somebody from a wonderful, notable ministry, you're going to find out about in two weeks if you're here, offered to me, to us, any book from this entire ministry's significant, formidable canon of written literature, amazing things. I could request any amount of any title in their entire canon to give away to our entire church. And so I did that. I asked very liberally. Andy said, go ahead and ask for something for your elders. Well, for the elders, I asked for the complete works. It's John Piper's ministry. I asked for the complete works of John Piper's ministry. And I sent him the email asking for this. And then I looked online at how much that cost. And the complete works of John Piper were, I don't remember what it was. The low side was in the 500s or 600s, and I just asked for seven of them. And I immediately felt, oh, my God, I felt ashamed. Like, wow, I really took advantage of this guy, and he's here trying to be nice and do a nice ministry. That's like Lot here in this passage. Abram gives him a kind offer. You go to the right, I'll go to the left. Lot looks out, and he finds what he likes, and he claims, and he takes it all. But I wonder if you notice, there are several danger signs in these words here, which Moses records for us and which I just read, tipping us off that Lot is walking towards and down a dangerous, deadly path. Did you notice? Look at verse 10. First of all, Lot lifted up his eyes, just like in the garden where the serpent tempted Eve with lies from hell. And Eve, we read, looked, and she saw that the tree was a delight to the eyes. What did she do? She trusted her eyes. The Bible makes this point again and again and again. You can live by what you see now right here in front of you with your eyes, or you can live by faith in the Word of God. Those are your two options. You cannot have both of them at the same time. Hebrews 11 records the names of those written in the annals of heaven's book of faith, including Abraham. And the chapter begins like this, Hebrews 11, verse 1. Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for. It is the conviction of things not seen. What do all these people in the hall of faith, so to speak, what do they all have in common? They lived by what they could not see. That's what it means to walk by faith. 2 Corinthians 5, 7, Paul says for we, that is those who are in Christ, we walk by faith and not by sight. The simple way to think about the Christian life as God intends for us to live it is we, the people of God, the church of God, who call ourselves Christians, we're to live less by our eyes and what we can see and more by our ears and what we can hear and what we've heard, especially in the words of God, in the promises of God. Lot here, Moses is trying to show you, is living by sight. And watch where following his eyes leads him in these verses. He saw in verse 10, he looks up and he sees that the Jordan Valley was well watered everywhere like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt. Egypt where Abram had just journeyed and barely made it out of alive. The garden where humanity has lost everything and since been banished from. Warning, warning, warning. So following his eyes, verse 11 continues, Lot journeyed east. Now this might not be obvious unless you've been following very carefully in Genesis, but in Genesis, Moses has carefully told his story in such a way that moving east, eastward is always a symbol of God's judgment. Genesis chapter 3, Adam and Eve sin. She takes the serpent's bait. Where does God banish them? Eastward, east of the garden. Genesis chapter 4, Cain and Abel. Cain kills his brother Abel and what does God do? He banishes him further. Chapter 4 verse 16 says, east of Eden. Genesis chapter 11, the people migrate. We read eastward and they settle in a plain and they construct the tower of Babel which incurs God's judgment yet again. Moving eastward is a symbol of danger and judgment in Genesis. And here Lot follows his eyes to the east. And verse 12 tells us that he settles his caravan as far as Sodom. Verse 13 says, by the way, the men of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the Lord. So watch this movement of Lot here. Lot leaves the safety of the promised land where Abram, his uncle, has God's blessing and he chooses, following his eyes, to go to the outskirts of the promised land to a city renowned in the ancient world, known throughout all the ancient world for its wickedness. I don't want to spoil the story because we're going to get there in due time. But in future chapters of Genesis for Lot, near Sodom, here in chapter 13, near Sodom becomes in Sodom and then becomes, it's clear by the end, he's part of Sodom. He sits at the city gate. He's part of the town. There's a clear, in other words, there's a clear downward spiral from near wickedness to among the wicked, to join to the wicked. And Lot suffers horrible consequences on account of his choices. But I just want you to see here that it all begins with the decision to move near Sodom, a city notorious for sin and for its sinners. That's the way sin works, isn't it? Always inch by inch, never showing its full and final designs. Let us all be careful, Christians, all be careful and help each other. Do not wait until a brother or sister is entirely gone and entirely married to wickedness before we reach out and cry, no, don't go that way. We should watch out for each other. So there's Lot's downward spiral, which Moses is telling for us. Meanwhile, there's Abram, learning to live by faith. Yesterday, just yesterday, he lived by sight. So when he saw with his eyes famine, no food, straight to Egypt he went for the safety of the Nile. Today, he's learning a little bit more what it means to live by the promises of God. Yesterday, he tried to control his life and control the outcomes, thinking that he could take these promises of God and keep them better than God could himself. Today, having fallen down and with a few more scrapes and bruises and failures on his resume, well, just look at him now. Today, does he look like a worried man? Does he seem anxious or fretting as he deals with the conflict with his nephew? Does he seem controlling? It's like the opposite of controlling here, yielding and trusting God. He's got a long ways to go, more tests to come and more scrapes and bruises to receive, but he's a little further along today than yesterday. And that's how this works. When you follow Jesus, you, my friend, enroll in the school of faith. And you don't graduate, none of us graduate. I know some of us hate school, but you don't graduate until glory. If you're a Christian here this morning, you're still in school, still being tested, still needing tutors, still very much learning what it means to live by faith and not by sight. When you live by sight, you fear and you fret and you grasp for power and control, just like the rest of the world does. But we're all, in Jesus, learning to live by faith, aren't we? Learning to live by the promises of God. Learning to live lives of giving and lives of service and lives of laying aside our rights for the good of others. Learning to pray and learning to wait upon God. Learning to wait for the future inheritance stored up for us in heaven. We're all in Christ, if we really are in Christ, learning to live lives of faith and not by sight. And here in Genesis, we're watching Abram, the great man of faith, learning himself the same thing. You should be thankful, I should be thankful, that our lives aren't recorded in slow motion as we fall down and venture down into Egypt and get back up again for all the rest of the world and all the rest of human history to read about. And finally, there's God, who responds to Abram's faith, did you notice? By renewing. So test number one, famine, Abram fails. And God bells him out by his sheer mercy. Another test this morning, another test in chapter 13. This time, Abram actually responds with baby steps of faith. Did you notice how God responds to this? He responds by renewing and even strengthening his promises to bless Abram. Look at verse 14 again. So the Lord, speaking to Abram again, after Lot had separated from him, saying, Lift up your eyes, Abram, and look from the place where you are, northward, southward, eastward, westward, for all the land that you see, I will give to you and to your offspring forever. I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if one can count the dust of the earth, so your offspring also can be counted. Arise, walk through the land and the breadth of the land, for I will give it all to you. So Abram moved his tent and came and settled by the oaks of Mamre, which are at Hebron, and there he built an altar to the Lord. Back in chapter 12, again, so significant. God first made this promise to Abram. What was the promise? Place, people, blessing. Place, people, blessing. He promised to give him a land that he would show to him. That's what he said in chapter 12. A land I'll show you, Abram. He doesn't know where it is. He doesn't know if it's an acre or a farm or something. Place, land. He promised to make him into a great nation, and he promised to bless him. Place, people, blessing. Here, I want you to see, God takes that promise and he expands it. Abram's walking by faith, and so God gives him the gift of letting him see a little bit more of what God is going to give to him. The land? Is it a few acres? Is it a nice little valley? No. Abram, look as far as you can see in every direction, verses 14 and 15. That's what I'm going to give to you, as far as your eyes can see, Abram. The people? Now, this can be confusing to us because we hear nations, we think Russia or something like that, right? I don't know why I went to Russia, first of all, but nations in the Bible aren't always these massive kingdoms like we think of. Nations are often towns or what we think of as small cities with a ruler. Abram doesn't know what this nation God is going to give him is going to be like. He doesn't know as he's approaching 80 and has no children how big and expansive this nation is going to be. God tells him, count the dust of the earth if you can. You see what he's doing? So shall your offspring be, God tells him in verse 16. I've got a Dyson because I'm chosen and loved by God. Do you guys know what a Dyson is? The most satisfying part of operating a Dyson is every few nights or weeks or whatever, when the thing gets full, you hold that dust reservoir up over the trash can and you press that eject button. There's an immediate plop and thump as the bigger, heavier stuff immediately falls down and joins the rest of the waste in the bottom of the trash can. But then afterwards, there's this beautiful, glistening, shimmering, magical display suspended in the air as the particles of dust dance their way slowly downward joining the heavier food and waste in the trash can. How many particles of dust is that? The contraption's like this big. How many thousands, millions is that? God tells Abram here, count all the dust of the earth, so shall your offspring be. Abram is eventually going to have a son and grandsons and granddaughters. I'm spoiling the story a little bit, but I think you know where this is going. Yes, the nation of Israel is going to come from him, from Abram. From that nation came the Lord Jesus Christ, a child of Abram, a child of Abraham, our Savior Jesus. He taught, Jesus taught, that God is able to raise up from these stones children of Abraham, Matthew 3.9. Then the apostle Paul, one of those first teachers and followers of Jesus, he also taught and further taught that indeed God has raised up children of Abraham from everywhere, even from stones, not just from the Jews. Know then, Paul says, that it is those of faith who are the sons and who are the daughters of Abraham, Galatians 3.7. And so God has done exactly what he promised to Abram in Genesis 13. The multitude of every tribe and every tongue and every nation all joined to Abraham, all sons of Abraham and all now sons of God by faith. What are the chances that we'd be here this morning, us of all people, worshiping Abraham's God? God's promises come true. Stack all the odds against them. They come true. They all come true. Bank your life on them. Bet everything you have on them. They will come true. And if you're here this morning and you're not yet a follower of Jesus, it is faith and faith alone that joins you to that vast number, as vast as the dust of all the earth. Faith that the Lord Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the only representative and substitute for sinners. That's what the cross is all about. It's God sending his own perfect son to stand in our place as our substitute, bearing upon his own back, his own body, his own soul, the very wrath of God that our sins deserved. Only trusting in him, his death and his resurrection, his victory over sin and over death. Only faith in that will join you to Abraham's children. And faith in that will join you to Abraham's children. Sons of God by faith in Jesus. Abram's learning just like we learn what it means to believe. And so here we see he builds another altar. He claims more territory for Yahweh. He worships God once more. Which leads us to this other story. This next adventure of Abram. This next class in the school of faith as Abram goes to war. So let's look now a bit more briefly at the second episode from Genesis 14 where Abram makes war. So we've got here what looks like an international war happening in the Middle East. Where we have four kings whose names we can't pronounce versus five kings whose names we can't pronounce. These nations were small, at least some of them, but this was significant. So these verses are a bit hard to follow. So let me try to help you out if you'll just look down at your Bible and I'll sort of guide you through what's actually happening here. At least from a big picture. Verses 1 through 3 of chapter 14 are telling you about the showdown. So it's four kings versus five kings. Verse 4 then goes back and tells you why this war broke out in the first place. So there was this one king who was over the rest of them. His name was Keter Leomar of Elam. That's an ancient civilization which roughly spans present day Iran and Iraq. And Keter Leomar of Elam ruled over other foreign cities and their kings, including those cities stretching into the plains of the Promised Land. So those other kings from these other faraway cities, they annually paid taxes to Keter Leomar. We've got a helicopter. I'm just going to wait. I can't even hear myself. Those other five kings paid taxes to Keter Leomar for 12 years and then in the 13th year they stopped. They rebelled. And so Keter Leomar comes for war against these rebels in the plains of the Promised Land. So that's verse 4. Verses 5 through 7 then tells you about all the battles that these four kings allied to Keter Leomar waged along their way to eventually conquer the five rebellious kings. It's just a trail of blood and conquering and dead bodies on their way into the Promised Land. And finally in verses 8 and 9, the showdown that we're waiting for between Keter Leomar and these five kings happens. And it's an absolute massacre. It's so bad that the doomed kings of the Promised Land run headlong into the bitumen pits. These are like tar pits around the Dead Sea. Basically the point is they're escaping one awful death at the hands of a murderous king for another awful death. Sinking and suffocating to death in a tar pit. This is how bad and how awful it is. Weeping and wailing. But all of this has nothing to do with the story of Genesis and with what God is uniquely doing in the world while all that mayhem is happening everywhere as is always the case. Until that fight comes to Abram's family as his nephew Lot is kidnapped and taken as a prisoner of war. Verse 11. I told you earlier Moses has already tipped you off in so many ways that Lot made a really dangerous choice. And now already we see danger has come to Lot. Now this is significant to our story for two reasons. First of all Abram's got the blessing. And second of all the Promised Land is now under threat at the hands of these foreign kings. Now again and again and again this is so important. In Genesis these aren't just like little random stories from ancient Jewish history and whatever Moses decided. Like I'll throw this one in here because I can remember this one. No these are stories about the promises of God. That's what Genesis is about. These are stories about the promises of God. And again and again and again just like last week and now again this week and for every other week to come the promises of God are under threat. Whether on account of Abram's foolishness or on account of foreign powerful warmongering kings. And so a refugee from Sodom makes it out. He escapes after this conquering of the Promised Land plains. He makes it out and runs. I assume he runs. I don't know that he runs. Moses doesn't say he runs. I imagine he runs 20 miles over to Hebron where Abram lives. He updates Abram of the situation. This man does. We don't know this man's name but I'm going to call him Paul Revere. Abram rallies together 318 of his own men. Who he's, we just read a little side note here. He's evidently been training for fighting in his own house. And he takes off with his 318 trained men in hot pursuit. In Dan, that is 120 miles from Abram's home. You just missed this when we don't know biblical geography. 120 miles later Abram and his 318 men catch up to this caravan of kings who are enjoying the spoils of their victories. And then a stealth attack happens in the night. No doubt taking them by surprise. Abram plunders them. He rescues Lot. Takes back all of his possessions before returning safely to home. Now that's awesome. But what, why? What is this all about? Why is this included in this account? What does Moses want us to see here? I want you to see two things from this seemingly random story of Abram going to war. First thing I want you to see is Adam. Adam? Yes, Adam. That Adam. Back in the garden God made Adam a king. He was commissioned by God, crowned by God even, to rule over the creation as God's prince, God's vice regent. He had dominion over earth and animal. Fill the earth and subdue it, God told him. Exercise dominion over every creature, God told Adam in Genesis 1, 26. But Adam, you know the story, was instead subdued by a creature, the serpent. He had the authority, Adam had the authority to banish that serpent from the garden, but he failed. He gave up his own crown. Humanity lost its rule, which begs the question, what would that have looked like had Adam never gave up his rule, crown, authority over creation? I don't know what it would have looked like, except that it would have been awesome. Way more awesome than Marvel or whatever you can imagine. And I just want to point out that Abram here looks like the ruler and defender of God's holiness that Adam was meant to look like. 318 men in the night, hunting down murderous kings and plundering them. Which means, here in Abram, we also have a picture of the second Adam. The king of kings, who walked on water, calmed storms, silenced demons, and ruled over all of nature as Adam was commissioned to do, but failed. And when he returns, the second Adam, who we know as the Lord Jesus, he will exercise dominion and rule over every creature and over all of creation. Abram, in this mysterious victory, reminds us of Adam and what might have been. Meaning, Abram, in this mysterious victory, also points us forward to Jesus and what someday will surely be when he returns. Second, God. Moses gives very few details of this war, other than to give the names, surely so that 2,000 years later, Josiah could be publicly mocked. I hope you don't. And who could do better than he did? He did amazing. Moses gives very few details, aside from the names of these kings. There's just one detail where he gets really specific. Did you notice? A number. 318. Abram's 318 men. Against the four kings and all their vast armies. We don't know how big they are. He doesn't say. No details there. But they just conquered all these lands, so surely massive. Why this detail of 318? I love how when you study this passage, by the way, commentators feel the need to understand how this was possible. So Abram's 318 men take down a horde of kings and their armies. How can that possibly be? And so they suggest all kinds of different things. This happened in the night, as the text says. So there's an element of surprise. These kings and their kingdoms weren't huge like we think of kings and kingdoms and so on. So fine, true, all well and good. But the point that Genesis is obviously trying to make is that Abram conquered these kings because Abram was God's chosen man. And because Abram had God's blessing. And so Abram's army of 318 men had God for its general. They conquered in spite of their size. That's exactly the point. Just like the story of Gideon, which we read about later in Judges 6 and 7. 32,000 men was way too many. 22,000 men was way too many. 10,000 men was way too many. The people might still miss the point if you have 10,000 men. So 300 men, God says. Route them with 300 men so that they'll know that this is me. Same deal here. Abram is God's man. His chosen instrument to redeem the world. This land here is God's land. God's to give and to take away to whomever he pleases. These promises are God's promises and who can stand against God? And so are all of God's promises to you who believe. And so have yourselves become children of Abraham. Every promise we believe, every promise we hope in is as good as God's sovereign strength. What a sweet comfort to those of us who cling to the promises of God. Where are you doubting the promises of God in your life? Where do you need to grow in your faith in the promises of God? Abram's faith is growing as God continues to keep and even strengthen all of his promises for Abram. Yesterday, Abram was down in Egypt, pawning off his wife to Pharaoh's harem. Today, he's entrusting himself to God and conquering kings and kingdoms. Romans 4, verse 20. You don't have to turn there, but Paul, the apostle, says there, of Abram, no unbelief made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he, notice these words, he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God. His faith grew. You're not just supplied. All the faith is one. Even Abram, the great man of faith, grew strong in his faith, Paul says, as he gave glory to God, fully convinced that God was able to do what he has promised. That's what we're witnessing this morning, God growing Abram stronger in his faith as he gives glory to God. Eric Weinmayer climbed the seven summits blind. Unbelievable. But do you know how he did it? Have you been trying to work out in your mind how that's even possible for a blind man to climb Everest? Spoiler, he didn't do it alone. He had a partner. Sometimes he had a team. And his partners were always with him, often yelling out directions. Hard left! Watch out for your right! Clear ahead! Go! Amazing. I love that. And a fitting picture of what the life of faith is to look like for all of us. If you and I look around you and we look around ourselves, if we live by sight, trials and temptations and money and power and fear and control, take things into your own hands, but if you and I will listen by faith to the promises of God recorded for us in scripture, bought for us by the very blood of Christ, and if we'll listen, you and I, to the people of God who have gone before us like Abraham, the man of faith, and even the little people around us in the local church, you and me, the nobodies. Stay left! Watch your right! Don't stop now! Better treasure ahead! Don't get stuck on that one! Wait! We'll make it to the top too. We'll make it home by faith, just like Abraham. Let's pray. Oh God, we want to say like John said, we believe, so help our unbelief. Holy Spirit, make us stronger in our trust in you. Strengthen our faith. We continue to pray this morning, God. Do it from your word. Do it from your promises. Do it by your Holy Spirit in our very hearts. God, for the ones who are maybe the most self-consciously weak and doubting and wavering right now, oh God, by your Holy Spirit, would you shed abroad in their hearts the love of Jesus for them and remind them of your promises and strengthen their faith. By faith in Christ, we pray. God, for the ones who are straying from you, God, we pray you would, in your grace and in your mercy, you would bring them back safely into your arms, just like you brought Abraham back in spite of himself, in spite of his wanderings in Egypt, as we saw last week. And God, for those who are not yet trusting in Jesus, we who believe, pray together right now that you would work a miracle in their hearts to give them faith, faith like Abraham, and you would prove yourself to be true to them just as you're proving yourself to be true and always reliable to all of us. And we pray all these things together in Jesus' name. Amen.
