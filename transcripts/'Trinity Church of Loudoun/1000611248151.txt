So, Paul is writing to the Corinthian church. You can guess that by the title of the book. And he's writing to them because they're in trouble. Corinth is this city that's got everything. It is very licentious. It is very wealthy. It is pretty similar to the city that you guys live in. The city that I live in. And instead of being salt and light in the community that they live in, they're starting to blend into the culture around them. You couldn't really tell the difference between these guys. Instead of humility and weakness being good Christian virtues, they were growing in pride. And Paul would later say, Look guys, you need to examine yourselves. Basically, you need to take a long hard look in the mirror. What had happened was that they had fallen in love with the idea of celebrity preachers. They've been led astray by these super apostles. In our text today, they were looking at Apollos. They were looking at Paul. And they were looking at their leaders in the wrong way. They were looking at them in a worldly way. For Apollos, they might have cried, Wow, he's such a great guy. And they put him on an ivory tower. Some said, No, I don't like Paul. He doesn't float my boat. He's not my sort of preacher. And they threw him under the bus. It would be like you guys saying, I follow Pastor Matt. He's just such a nice guy. He is a nice guy, but... Well, no, I follow Pastor Nick. He just speaks to my heart. There's something about him. Maybe another one says, No, I follow Pastor Dave. He's really wise. All of them are nice guys. All of them are guys that I hope speak to your heart. And all of them are guys that are wise. But we have our preferences, don't we? If we really look at our own hearts. You see, that attitude, creating that attitude, And so Paul has to write this letter to the very people that don't like him. And Paul says in verse 1, something that he prayerfully hopes will change their thinking and their mindset. He says, Church family, this is how you should regard us. This is how you should regard us. This is how you should regard us. This is how you should regard us. This is how you should regard us. This is how you should regard us. This is how you should view us. This is how you should look at us. This is how you're to view the elders within Trinity Church. Or the church down the road. And I like what Paul does here. He doesn't say, Look where I'm from, guys. Does he? He doesn't say, I'm the Pharisee of Pharisees. Or do you know what? Look at the PhD above my desk. He doesn't say that. He doesn't say, Look at the family I'm from. He doesn't try to impress them. But he says, You are to view us as servants and stewards. So let's look at the first point then. The servant. Verse 1 to 5. Let's read it. This is how one should regard us. As servants of Christ and stewards of the mystery of God. Moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found faithful. But with me, it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human core. In fact, I don't even judge myself. For I am not aware of anything against myself. But I'm not thereby acquitted. It is the Lord who judges me. Therefore, do not pronounce judgment before the time. Before the Lord comes, who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart. Then, each one will receive his commendation from God. The servant. Now, my wife, she used to love a TV show. I'm pretty sure that Americans like this TV show but it's called Downton Abbey. Yeah? You want to know about the UK? Then you go and watch shows like that. But I don't know much about it. Those sort of TV shows aren't my thing. But it gives a good image of what Paul's trying to describe here for the Corinthian church. In Downton Abbey, you'd have the master of the house. And you'd have the servants who'd be appointed by the master who would make sure that all the jobs were done. It would be anything. Maybe cleaning out the stables, polishing the little silver spoons, making the beds. But if the master of the house gave you a job, you'd make sure you did it. And Paul's saying, look, we're all servants. All of us. We're all servants of Christ. He's the master. We report to Him and we all serve Him in the different roles He's given us. And he's saying, look, we're not to be focused on what the other servants want us to do or what another master down the road wants us to do. But ultimately, we are to be found faithful. We are to be loyal servants of what Jesus has given us to do. Because in reality, Paul is saying that the only opinion that matters in this room, in all of history, in all of time, is God's opinion. In verse 2, the Son of God, Jesus Christ, has entrusted His servants, Paul and Apollos, with the Word of God and the hope of the Gospel. That's what He's entrusted to them. They've been trusted to preach and teach the Word of God. That's what your leaders have been entrusted to do. It doesn't revolve around a big character or your preferences or what style of worship you like, but the truth, the whole counsel of God, which is able to save souls and is able to build up the believer. And in an age that hates the words sin, hell, and repentance, that's really important. Paul is saying in verse 3 that though you may examine me, he's talking to the church, though you may examine me, though you may have your preferences and you have your likes and dislikes, though you may judge me, though you may throw me under the bus, compare me to others, he says, I don't care. Because as verse 4 says, it is Jesus, the Son of God, who will judge me. See, they were judging Paul and Apollos by their own standards, by worldly standards. When they were making a hire or they were looking to get someone into a little church plant, they were saying, well, what does the world like? Maybe a big charismatic guy, maybe a great speaker, but godly character? No, we don't really care that much about that. Verse 5 says, do not pronounce judgment before the time, before the Lord comes, who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart. See, a day is coming when Jesus will judge and examine all of us sitting in this room, all of us, from the little children to the people in the winter of their years to married couples, singles, all of us will be judged before the living gods. We're going to stand in the dock of God's judgment. And it doesn't matter what others think about you. They may think you're a really nice guy. Maybe you're a great wife, a great husband, a great student. Maybe you're successful in society. But the only thing that matters on judgment day is what God thinks. Most people in the community may only see you at work. They might see you at Walmart or Target, some of these places that are unfamiliar to me. They might see you down at a football game. It is God who sees you in the secret, the private places when the curtains are drawn. He is the one that the text says will bring to light the things we have hidden in our lives, all those skeletons that we think no one knows. He knows. So if God isn't treated with reverence and faithfulness in the home, then your reverence and faithfulness here means very little. When you meet the Lord, he will either say, well done, good and faithful servant, or he will say, I never knew you. So Paul puts these Corinthians all on the same boat. He's effectively saying, look, no one is greater than the other. We all have an awe. We're all rowing in the same direction and we all have the same captain and master, Jesus Christ, and it will be him that we stand before. I remember an old pastor saying to me as I was going into ministry and he was sort of warning me about different things, things within my own heart, things to expect. He said, look, Gerald, I don't care what others think about me or want me to be. All that matters is that I be found faithful before Jesus Christ. How could the apostle Paul say that people are to view him as a servant of Christ? Surely he's the guy that we should all get the fine china out for. Surely he's the guy that is the celebrity. You imagine knowing that you were once a persecutor of the church. You approved of the murder of Stephen. In fact, you watched him as stone after stone hit his face, hit his body, until he stopped moving. And yet because Jesus came as a suffering servant, was beaten and killed for a sinner like him, rose again three days later, he now has peace with God. He's been forgiven of all of that. Knowing all that humbles a person, doesn't it? You no longer walk around like a peacock, like the big I am. I'm not just saying this to you guys. I can do that in my own heart. But now he's walking around as a servant, character, humility. Remember a pastor called Ian Hamilton. He gave advice to those seeking to enter the ministry. And he said, are you ready to die? He was talking to us men. He was like, are you ready to die? Are you ready not for badges of celebrity praise, but spiritual scars and servant faithfulness? Paul's high calling was to preach, to pray for, and to pass to the flock as a servant of Christ. So Paul says, look, you're to regard your leaders as servants of Christ. Secondly, Paul addresses their pride in verse 6 to 13. Follow along in your Bibles. I've applied all these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, brothers, that you may learn by us not to go beyond what is written, that none of you may be puffed up in favor of one against another. For who sees anything different in you? What do you have that you did not receive? If then you received it, why do you boast as if you did receive it? Already you have all you want. Already you have become rich. Without us you have become kings. And would that you did reign so that we might share the rule with you. For I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all, like men sentenced to death because we have become a spectacle to the world, to angels and to men. We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are held in honor, but we disrepute. To the present hour we hunger and thirst. We are poorly dressed and buffeted and homeless, and we labor, working with our hands. When reviled, we bless. When persecuted, we endure. When slandered, we entreat. We have become, and are still like the scum of the world, the refuse of all things. Paul needed to address the pride of the Corinthian church, and he does this in a very blunt and sarcastic way. I don't know if you got that from the text, but he's almost like a Scottish person. They are very blunt and very sarcastic. And sometimes the best way to share the truth in love is not to beat around the bush, is it? It's just to tell them as it is, and that's what he does. See, the Corinthian church had a worldly image of themselves and others, and not a biblical image. It had infected the church, and clearly they had this bad view of Paul, and they had this puffed-up view of themselves. Back in the day, when a Roman general won a great victory over his enemies, what he would do is he would march at the front with all his horses coming behind him, chariots, centurions. Then at the very back would be the captured people. They'd be thrown tomatoes. They'd be thrown what was left in the bin, and then they'd be put in a coliseum. And Paul's given this image, and he's saying, look, you guys think you're kings. See, we live in an age, we live in a world, we live in a time, like back then, that seeks to stroke our own egos. Just have to look around, and it's this celebration, not of God, not of the Creator, but it's this celebration of self and the created. And Paul, he warned a young Timothy about this in 2 Timothy 3, verse 2. We can go there now and have a little look at it, because I think it's quite a good parallel, but 2 Timothy 3, verse 2. And he says, For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving goods, and the list goes on. The key thing there is lovers of self. Just the other day, my wife and I went on a little coffee morning, a little date morning. We like going down to this place along the beach, called The Beach House. We saw some young girls with cameras, and they were on their phone, and they were taking selfies of themselves, and then all of a sudden this stick came out of nowhere. They attached it to that and just zoomed out. And what was really saddening, actually, was they went out of that place, and we thought, oh, they must be done. But they went onto the beach, and instead of actually looking around, they were just still doing it. It's this idea of lovers of self. It's infected our society. And whether we like it or not, it's infected us in some way or another. You only have to look at what people share on Facebook. What they talk about at work. Much of it's all about self. It's everywhere. Recently, I read one of these little self-love quotes online. You probably know what I'm talking about. You're enough. You're the best. You're needed. You deserve happiness. You are worthy of love. Sorry, but what we would say in the UK is, what a load of garbage. What a load of garbage that is. It's a pile of rubbish. You see, self-love is sin. Why? Because it's worshipping self and not God. In fact, the early church father, Augustine, he said, you have made us for yourself, Lord, and our hearts are restless until they find their rest in you. Much of my teenage life was spent trying to find rest in things. You may hear tonight a bit of my testimony if you come along, but I was adopted. My mum was a Polish alcoholic, and I was very blessed in God's providence not to come out with alcohol fetal syndrome, or whatever it's called. But I still wrestled with rejection in my teenage years, fear of man, people-pleasing, all of those sorts of things, and I tried to find it in the rugby guys. I was quite successful with rugby, and that team became like my brotherhood. But my restless heart was trying to find it in those things, trying to earn people's affirmation. Now, that's just my story, and you probably know your own heart this morning. But lovers of self, such a pandemic in our country and in your country. And so Paul is warning the Corinthians, look, don't get caught up in the culture that you live in. Don't pursue being lovers of self, but instead pursue being lovers of God, the one you were made for. See, the Corinthians had a problem with pride, and maybe you have that problem with pride this morning. Maybe me talking about it is getting you all itchy and twitchy and restless in your seat, and if so, good, good. These guys were proud of their education, their teachers, their family, their success, the things God had given them. They were boasting in those things. They thought they were God's gift to the world and kings. A lot of times I hear people in my own community, and you probably have it here too, but they boast about where they're from, the job they have, the money they earn, the reputation they have. A lot of times my own heart wants to boast in my own achievements. But the Bible says God doesn't care. In fact, the Westminster Catechism gives this description of sins forgiven by the ninth commandment. It says that these are flattering, excessive boasting, thinking or speaking too highly of ourselves or others, fond admiration. Do you do that? As Christians, we have to guard against this in our lives. The way that we guard it in our lives is by looking into the mirror of God's words, seeing the ugliness of our sin, seeing that our works are but filthy rags, but then at the same time seeing the beauty of God's grace and the work of Jesus Christ. Paul uses himself and Apollos as this illustration to show them that they have a problem. In verse 6 he says, all these things, all these things that I've been writing about in the previous chapters, they are here so that what? We'll look at the end of verse 6. They are here so that none of you may be puffed up. The thing is, if you're not in the words, you're going to become puffed up. You're going to become worldly. If you open up the words, it's going to humble you. It's going to challenge you. It's going to prevent you from becoming puffed up. That's the purpose. And that word is a good picture of pride, isn't it? Puffed up. I don't know if you've ever seen one of these discovery channels, you see a little puffer fish, it's a tiny little thing, just swimming around, minding its own business, and something comes along that intimidates it or threatens it, and it swells up, you know. And in the same way, people puff themselves up. When I used to go to the gym, it was an old spit and sawdust gym, I don't know if you know what that means, but it was an old school gym back in the day, and a lot of the guys there used to do steroids and different things. And as soon as a big guy comes past, all the other guys are puffing their chests up and trying to look hench, you know. When we get scared, when we get intimidated, when we feel out of our depth, we puff ourselves up. We puff ourselves up, trying to make ourselves look more successful than we actually are, more pretty than we actually are, that's what Instagram's for, isn't it? You get the filter on, takes all the spots, the pimples off. More wealthy than we actually are, there's a lot of people in debt, with nice fancy cars going around, trying to look as though they've got it all. In reality, they host so much money. People try and puff themselves up by showing that they're popular, by hanging around the cool kid at school. We've all done it. We all like to exaggerate stories about ourselves. You know, the dads that could have made it pro? That's what we have in the UK, probably the same here. We were on holiday recently, and my kids, I took them fishing, and we caught some really nice fish, and did a barbecue on the beach. I did my Bear Grylls thing. You know, I felt really proud of myself. Cut it open, and... And my kids, they caught this fish, and the way that they described it, you would have thought they caught Moby Dick. It was this little tiddler that came out, and it was huge. In their eyes, it was huge. Every time they told someone, it was like a whale or something, or Megalodon, you know. But we do this on social media. We build up this picture of ourselves to get more likes, more retweets, more hearts, and the problem with doing this is it's like a sandcastle. Whenever we try and puff ourselves up, it's like a sandcastle, okay? You're down the beach. You're having to build it up, and then the wave of reality comes in, and it washes it all away, and we just have to try and keep building it up, keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up the appearance, keeping up the act. It takes work. It takes time. But the wave of reality is a good thing. The wave of reality is found in verse 7. For who regards you as superior, or who sees anything impressive in you? Paul says in verse 7, why do you boast? Why do we boast? What have we got to prove? If you're a Christian this morning, then Ephesians 2 is a very healthy, humbling reminder, isn't it, for us? Ephesians 2, we read, and you were dead in your trespasses and sins. But God, but God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he has loved us, even when we are dead in our trespasses and sins, made us alive together with Christ. By grace, you have been saved. I don't see my signature anywhere on that verse. I don't see my work anywhere involved in that. I see that, actually, the only thing I've contributed is trespasses and sins, and because of that, I am dead. But God, God's mercy and grace alone. You and I were spiritually dead, floating corpses, until Jesus came in and rescued any of us. We were floating with the spiritual fishes. It's why Paul, in verse 7, says that we have received this. And if you have received it from God, why are you boasting? You know, the gospel is the most humbling truth, because it forces you in this selfie generation to look away from yourself and look at Christ crucified, risen from the dead. It's what we celebrate every week, not just at Easter. That's why we should say, like John the Baptist, may he increase and may I decrease. It's so countercultural. One old hymn says this, Behold the man upon a cross, my sin upon his shoulders. Ashamed I hear my mocking voice, call out among the scoffers. It was my sin that held him there until it was accomplished. His dying breath has brought me life. I know that it is finished. I will not boast in anything, no gifts, no power, no wisdom, but I will boast in Jesus Christ, his death and resurrection. That's why I like Paul, because he deals directly with the problem of the Corinthian church. He deals with the problem of this church. He deals with the problem of my own heart. He invites us to grieve over our pride. He invites us to look at all that God has done for us. He encourages us to walk in humility as redeemed people. But he doesn't just leave them there with this challenge, does he? He points them to the example. The example, the third point, the example. Verse 14 to 21, and then we'll close. I do not write these things to make you ashamed, but to admonish you as my beloved children. For though you have countless guides in Christ, you do not have many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel. I urge you then, be imitators of me. That is why I sent you, Timothy, my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, to remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach them everywhere in every church. Some are arrogant, as though I were not coming to you. But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills. And I will find out not the talk of these arrogant people, but their power. For the kingdom of God does not consist in talk, but in power. What do you wish? Shall I come to you with a rod, or with love and a spirit of gentleness? Again, I don't know if you noticed there, the change in Paul's tone. Paul's gone from doing what every pastor should do in challenging sin, but he's also coming to them in this fatherly manner. He says that there, he comes to them as a father. These are his children in the faith. He's preached the hope of Jesus Christ to them in Corinth. And he's seen families, he's seen singles turn from sin and turn to Christ. So he's warning them now as children in the faith. He's warning them as I would my own kids when they go astray. I'd raise my voice to warn them, don't do that, don't run near that road, don't touch that flame, don't do it. And then I'd cuddle them in and say, come on, don't go near these things, they're not good for you. Paul's not smashing their face in the dirt and trying to make them feel ashamed and guilty, but he's giving them this firm warning because he loves them. And so he urgently asks them to be imitators of him. Later on in Corinthians, he asks them to follow his example. And in Thessalonians 1 verse 6, he says, Last year we went away on a holiday to the highlands in Scotland. It's just maybe three, four hours away from where we live in Edinburgh. And I gave my oldest son a penknife. It was my dad's penknife, he gave it to me when I was younger. And I gave it to my son, he was excited. Don't think I'm a bad parent, by the way. He was old enough and I think wise enough to look after it. And when I gave it to him, he starts trying to get it, open it up and everything. I said, hang on a minute, hold your horses, son. Hold your horses. I need to show you first how to use it. And so I got this stick and I started to cut it. And I said, look, you've got to cut away from yourself, tuck your thumb in. I said, look, you've got to copy my example. That's what Paul's saying here. You've got to follow my example. My dad has lived a long life, he's 82 now. And he's displayed to me such godly character. The way that he's talked to my mum, the way that he's loved us as children, the way that he's led the church. And I've watched him for 35 years of my life. I seek to copy him, not because he's perfect, but because he's set me a godly example. That's what Paul's doing here. He's not perfect, we know that. In fact, he would say, guys, I'm a rat, I'm a sinner. Saved by grace. He's saying, look, as your spiritual father, copy my example. He's founded that church family on the gospel of Jesus Christ and the word of God. And he's set them an example in the way that he's talked and the way that he's lived. And he's discipling them by saying now, follow my example. Don't follow the example of the world, follow my example. And then he says, I'm about to come home and set the house in order. I don't know if you were a little troublemaker as a kid like I was, but I often got in trouble and would often be up to mischief. Either I was a pyromaniac trying to set things alight with a bit of glass or I'd be having a fight with someone down the street. But my mom used to say something that used to put the fear into me. She used to get me and she used to look at me and she said, you wait until your father gets home. You wait until your father gets home. Well, here their father in the faith was going to visit them and he says, buck up your ideas, kids. Sort it out before I get home. Guys, my encouragement to you as a church is to look for faithful Christians in the church and seek to copy their example. Don't copy the example of your mates, your work colleagues, your family, the world's celebrities. Bad company corrupts good morals. This is the example for you to follow. If you love Jesus Christ, be servants of Christ. Be humble. Follow the example of godly leaders and be an example to those around you. But I tell you what, we desperately need the power of the Holy Spirit to do that. To be what we ought to be. If I try and do this in my own strength, then I'll be prone to wonder. I'll be prone to fail. We are weak people so we need to abide in Christ. We need to ask for his help daily. Paul in verse 20 said that the Christian life isn't all talk. It isn't knowing some Christian chat that you learn in a Sunday school class or in a quip group. But it's a knowledge of God and the power of the gospel that transforms the way we think and the way we live. And boy do we need to make Jesus the example in our lives. Not the celebrities of the world around us. Not the people on our street and in our communities, but Jesus. Paul daily walked with God. He talked with God. Spent time in his word. And if you're going to be a humble servant of Jesus Christ within this church and within this community, if you're going to reach the lost, then you need to follow Jesus Christ. 1 John 2 verse 6 says, whoever says he abides in him ought to walk in the same way in which he walked. So how should the church view its leaders? How should you view your elders? You should view them as servants of Christ. How should we walk before God and others? We should walk with a humble walk. Godly character matters. And whose example should we follow? We should look for the example of good godly men and women around us who seek to follow the great example that is Christ. May God help us. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we are so sorry for the times that we have wandered. So sorry for the times that we have looked to the world. So sorry for the times that we've boasted in ourselves. I pray that as we look at the gospel daily, you would make us men and women of godly character. Men and women that seek to walk in humility. Men and women that seek to be an example to others around us. We are so thankful for Jesus Christ this morning. So thankful that although you were in heaven, where the angels cried holy, holy, holy, you came to a world where we spiritually shouted crucify him. You have set for us an example of the suffering servant. So help us as we leave this place to be servants of Christ. To know that the master is going to come home one day and call all of us to give an account for how we've lived it. Will we be found faithful? Will we be found unfaithful? Empower us by your spirit to be faithful men, women and children. That live for Jesus Christ. Amen.
