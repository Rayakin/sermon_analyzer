Good morning. I saw the forecast late last night and this morning that we're we got some flurries or we're expecting to get some flurries and alas disappointed again. I was looking back. I think it was a couple years ago this Sunday a couple years ago this Sunday. We're still back at Creighton's Corner and we actually got snowed out. So we had to do a little we have to go back to doing video stuff at least for that Sunday. Lord, thankfully, we're now in our own space and don't quite have the same problems. We're going to be in Galatians 6. So if you have a Bible and have not yet turned there you can turn there be looking at the first 10 verses as Jay read for us. And as you can see, we are coming up to the end of the letter just one more to go Lord willing wrapping up in April and for each of these sermons. I've been giving a little bit of review of what's been happening to kind of get us back up to speed with what he's been talking about the letter to today's today's going to be a little longer because been some time and just to refresh us and what Galatians has been about on paper at least the points therefore are shorter, but we'll see about that what we see as we enter chapter 6 is Paul is starting to get practical. He's just spent chapter 5 talking about the differences between walking by the spirit and walking by the flesh. He's shown us that those are very different things with very different destinations and now in chapter 6 he gives us examples of how to live by the spirit what that looks like practically. But as he does so he does something very fascinating. He returns to the main subject of the letter. You might have caught it back in verse 2. He starts to give examples of how to live by the spirit by describing it as the law do you see that chapter 6 verse 2 bear one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ. Now maybe that doesn't strike you or you've only been with us recently but whenever Paul has talked about the law so far in the letter he's never talked about it positively. This is how he describes the law straight his words earlier in the letter. No one is justified by works of the law. If a law had been given that could give life then righteousness would indeed be by the law but there isn't so it can't. You are severed from Christ you who would be justified by the law. You have fallen away from grace. So you hear what he's saying. The law can't do what you want it to do stop looking to the law stop heading toward the law for what only faith can provide the law is a dead end in that respect the law then for the bulk of his letter so far Paul's described it as part of the problem if you remember what the Galatians problem was they had false teachers come in and convince them that the law of Moses the first five books of the Bible the laws that would govern the Jewish people for centuries in some ways even today that those laws keeping those laws along with Jesus's death and resurrection that is how you get righteousness those fall teachers were telling them that yes Jesus died and rose again yes but I mean you're gonna just throw away everything that our forefathers did and kept and obeyed and honored God with no no you got to do it you got to do it all so the Galatians who were mainly Gentiles they started to eat like Jews they started to get circumcised like the Jews and that made Paul mad because if righteousness were through the law he says then Christ died for no purpose the law was given not to make us righteous but to show us our unrighteousness to have a standard by which we would understand what is wrong with us so that we'd understand righteousness could only ever come from outside of us by faith we saw this last week in Genesis 15 Abraham the father of the Jews he himself didn't become righteous by keeping some law right how did how was he counted righteous he believed God he believes specifically in the God who would provide for him and offspring even at his advanced age even despite Sarah's age as well he believed God that offspring of course would be Jesus Matthew in the first verse of his gospel describes Jesus Christ as the son of David and the son of Abraham closing the loop for us okay then so the law trusting in law keeping the law obeying the law doesn't actually get us righteousness so we don't have to keep any laws then right no look look just above chapter 6 at chapter 5 verse 13 for you were called to freedom brothers only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh but through love serve one another verse 14 for the whole law is fulfilled in one word you shall love your neighbor as yourself what's going on here Paul it sounds like the law might be worth keeping after all that it's not something that we can just dismiss Paul actually when he when he says that you should love your neighbor so if he's quoting from the Old Testament is quoting from the law Leviticus 19 so what do we have here it seems like we have on the one hand the fact that obeying the law cannot save you at the same time on the other hand what we have is that the law is still to be obeyed obeying the law can't save you but the law is still to be obeyed what's the deal what Paul wants us to see what's so hard for us to normally see because we tend to think in either or ways is that those two things are not in conflict that in fact knowing that obeying the law doesn't save you is the best way to obey the law that's how you properly obey the law as God meant for you to think about think about school kids I'm I don't know how this will end going to school doesn't automatically get you your dream job I'm sorry but I trust that all probably all the adults in here would concur with that going going to school doesn't automatically get you your dream job you some of you may have your dream job but you know that it took more than just the fact that you were sitting in a classroom for all those years but but you still need to go to school why because the real function of school is deeper than just getting the job you want on the other side the deeper function of school is to grow into the learning and thinking and communicating being that God created you to be and as we get older we discover what kind of learner and thinker and communicator we are school helps serve that purpose and so if you approach school that way you might get your dream job on the other side or you might not but either way what school will have actually meant to accomplish in your life will have happened so bring it back when we can see that keeping the law is not what saves us on the other side of keeping law is not salvation when we see that we can then see what keeping the law does do what it is for it is for us to see and share the goodness of God it's not to save you it's to show who God is that's the freedom that Paul is talking about in verse 13 when Jesus freed you from the judgment of the law when he was born under the law died to the law resurrected over the law when he freed you from the judgment of the law he also freed you from having to live to score points with God to loving others because that's what he has done for you you see the difference that that's kind of the Christian life being free to not have to try to appease God convince him rip rub him in the ribs I don't know what I'm sure what I'm trying to convey here prod him poke him hey look at me I'm okay right we don't have to do that anymore what is that allows to do it allows us to look straight at him and see what is he like what is he done for me what has he actually done for me that's what obeying the law showcases that's the Christian life that's the way of the spirit there's no more there's no more Jewish program to follow now we just follow what we see in God God becomes our law as it were that's how he says in our text verse 2 the law of Christ he's not contradicting everything he's just said about the law so that that's the thread that's gonna pull through our whole passage the law of Christ so we'll break it down like this one long sentence broken down in four parts the law of Christ requires us to number one do good to fellow sinners the law of Christ requires us to first do good to fellow sinners second and fellow sufferers third and our shepherds fourth and finally in view of eternity the law of Christ requires us to do good to fellow sinners sufferers shepherds in view of eternity that's what Paul saying let's look at that first part doing good to fellow sinners verse 6 6 and 7 no sorry verse 1 brothers if anyone is caught in any transgression you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness keep watch on yourself lest you to be tempted how do you see how fitting it is do you feel how fitting it is that the first scenario Paul gives us for observing the law of Christ following what we see in Jesus is when fellow sinners sin you feel how appropriate that is the first time in this letter Paul tells us the difference that all this doctrine should make in how we treat each other how us personally understanding that we're justified by faith not by works and that everybody who gets that is adopted into the same family of God what should that look like number one you are gentle with other people when they sin so that they can be restored how appropriate is that what more practical way is there that we can follow Jesus it's it's practicing exactly who he is to other people we read a minute ago that Jesus is gentle and lowly in heart it's been a popular book wonderful book we have a lot of copies I have a lot of cops in my office if you want one talks the author talked about the only time only time Jesus explicitly describes what his heart is like says his heart is gentle and what a crazy thing I was reading Hosea recently and was struck again struck again at how terrible we are and yet how our terribleness cannot shake God's love for us chapter after chapter God says he warns he warns the people with statements like this because of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them out of my house I will love them no more pretty clear woe to them for they have strayed from me destruction to them for they have rebelled against me says God talking about his people and yet Hosea chapter 10 for instance God how can I give you up Oh Ephraim how can I hand you over Oh Israel my heart recoils within me my compassion grows warm and tender over you Hosea 11 the more they were called the more they went away they kept sacrificing to the bales and burning offerings to idols yet I took them up by their arms they didn't know that I healed them I led them with cords of kindness with the bands of love and I became to them as one who eases the yoke on their jaws I bent down to them and fed them Hosea 14 I will heal their apostasy I will love them freely for my anger has turned from them friends have you ever sinned maybe you're thinking okay but let's just just go to the bottom floor of that question have you ever loved anything or anyone more than God that's the central virus in all of us that's how that's what spills out as lying as anger as lust as greed so yeah if you've sinned a few times you know what that means it means two things it means one you are deservedly in the crosshairs of God's wrath it just is what it is but two it means that you are also the perfect candidate for still being loved by God for being forgiven by him for being restored to him that's what Jesus came to do he didn't come just to be this incredibly kind man this wise man to pattern your life after he came first and foremost to take away your sin to the degree that when he died on the cross your sin also died on the cross to the degree that when he rose from the dead your righteousness also rose with him he's already done it he did it because he wanted to do it and he wanted to do it because he loves you my friend do you believe will you believe that God could actually love you like this he loves us and so he restores us the word Paul uses there for restore in verse 1 the Gospels use that word for when fishermen would mend their nets to be used again in that a good picture nets torn ripped by use overuse weakness put back together for use again is not a good picture than for how we should care for one another when sin takes us down if Jesus is willing to restore us time and time again how should we restore one another not with should we restore one with shaming with coldness no a spirit of gentleness that restores and that helps people get back up again and we do that as the verse continues because we know that we can be tempted to what so you see where Paul says those who are spiritual should restore what Paul doesn't he's not talking about some elite class of believers some extra spiritual people who are above temptation think about remember what Galatians is he's literally scolded the entire church for abandoning the gospel there's no there are no elite believers here he's making the point that all who are justified by faith however immature however young however weak they have still received the spirit by faith and so this responsibility is for all who are weak and broken and frail in their spirits they still have the spirit of God some of you maybe need to hear that even in your weakness or your your newness to Christianity the Bible still calls you spiritual you to have the spirit of Christ the same spirit that every other believer has and that you're here because God might use you to gently restore one of us what a privilege what a godly thing to do others of us will need to hear to beware of how spiritual we think we are keep watch Paul says to us you may be restoring a sinner today it might be you tomorrow the law of Christ requires us to do good to fellow sinners number two and fellow sufferers verse two bear one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ for if anyone thinks he is something he is enough when he is nothing he deceives himself but let each one test his own work and then his reason to boast will be in himself alone and not in his neighbor for each will have to bear his own load law of Christ isn't just restoring one another from sin it requires bearing one another's burdens and the fascinating Paul could have used a hundred other things to summarize what the law of Christ is like he chooses this idea to summarize what the law of Christ what fulfilling the law of Christ is that significant number one it tells us something significant about what Jesus ministry is doesn't it that if you took all the data of what Jesus does for us who he is for us even now and in the future and if you zoom out it would it would show that Jesus's ministry to you to me is that he bears your burdens have you thought about Jesus's ministry in your life has that he's your burden bearer we of course see it so clearly in our greatest burden our greatest need the one we couldn't carry out on our own and still live our sin before God but think about the burdens that that required him to add the burden of becoming a man living with human limitations aging needs the burden of living among sinners almost all of whom rejected him or just wanted to use him some who would betray him others who would literally kill him living among them the burden of not a single other person understanding what your life is like or what's going to happen to you the lonesomeness of that the burden of Gethsemane pleading one last time with the only one who does understand and yet hearing no answer the burden of being stripped and shamed and crucified the burden of being forsaken by his eternal father he bore our burdens to Calvary and suffered and died alone as the hymn goes of course if he stayed there we would not be here it's the Super Bowl today but he resurrected and even now in heaven he is still ministering to us Galatians 4 he has given us his spirit by whom we can call him Abba father first Peter 5 he invites us to cast all our anxieties or burdens on him now because he cares for us now Hebrew 7 he seated at the right hand of the father he's interceding for us now says he always lives to make intercession for us we see this again Romans 8 it's too good to just read part of it if Christ Jesus is the one who died more than that who was raised who was at the right hand of God who indeed is interceding for us then who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword no in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us for I'm sure that neither death nor life nor angels nor rulers nor things present or things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord brothers and sisters the burden of being judged for your sin has been lifted but don't we know burden still happen in life burdens at home burdens in relationships physical burdens financial burdens and yet what has God said persecution famine distress death itself through all of that I will hold you you may have heard this week that this past week at the Church of England after five years of conversations and eight hours of final debate they voted this past week to approve quote prayers of dedication Thanksgiving and God's blessing for same-sex marriages and partnerships they didn't vote to change their formal position on marriage as a whole they officially do not yet approve of same-sex marriage but nevertheless even in this move this vote this was a departure from historic Christianity certainly not be a surprise if their stance on marriage as a whole would in fact be amended over time and in the middle of this most recent debate there are several on the conservative side who are themselves same-sex attracted and celibate they shared in prepared speeches that this decision in the name of inclusivity would actually alienate them in the church it would discredit what they clearly read in Scripture it would ignore how they've committed to obey God despite real personal and social cost how they operate how they engage how they receive from the church now overlooked that's a unique burden that's a complicated burden that's a heartbreaking burden and what they must hear also as each of us with the heaviness in our own lives is that God your father knows he knows how hard it is he knows it every second of every day he also knows when he's bringing you home he's charted it all so you must know that until that day he holds his children through all things everything that Paul listed he literally said everything else in all creation because Jesus Christ God's son died and now lives and he is spending his living time interceding for you which means whether your burdens vanish this second or they linger and even overwhelm you some days they will never mean that God has let you go you belong to him one author puts it Jesus's intercession is him constantly hitting refresh on our belonging to God for eternity this is Jesus ministry to us past present into the future doesn't it then in light of that doesn't it make sense then of how high how encompassing of a call it is for Paul to say that this is what fulfilling the law of Christ looks like he's saying you want to be like Jesus be a burden bearer if we are his body if we are his body it makes sense as he intercedes for our burdens that he uses his body to carry some of our burdens you see that which means there's some natural questions that should arise for us do you know anyone that's burdened right now financially spiritually physically relationally if so is there anything you can do about it do you share your burdens with others and welcome others to share theirs if practical needs are shared or they come to mind do you ever answer the call yourself if not it'll be hard for you to fulfill the law of Christ which means it'll be hard for you to be a growing Christian if you are never a burden bearer if you're a burden avoider it's not what Jesus did it might be because of what verse 3 describes you've deceived yourself into thinking that you're too strong or too spiritual to be overtaken by burdens or that your time is too important to be spent helping people who can't help themselves there's also a pride to that comes when others others weaknesses make you look good in comparison makes you feel like you're something when you're nothing you will not fulfill the law of Christ on the other hand you can't take pride too much in how much you can bear others burdens especially if it means ignoring the burdens God has placed in your life that's what verse 4 and 5 seem to be getting at either you see yourself as a helper to others while never addressing your issues or you actually never help anybody else but take credit for what other people have done in either case verse 5 Paul saying we will all each of us stand before God ourselves at the end of the day and we will ourselves have to answer for how we handled the burdens God assigned to us and the burdens he assigned to those around us did we ignore them did we see ourselves as something when we are nothing the law of Christ requires us to do good to fellow sinners fellow sufferers and our shepherds verse 6 and 7 let the one who was taught the word share all good things with the one who teaches to not be deceived God is not mocked for what whatever one sows that will he also reap feel like my whole ministry has led me to this moment every pastor in the world has got a text pray for brother Chung he's about to step up for all of us to be sure it is saying what it sounds like it's saying pay those who teach you the word I would align with what he has said about bearing burdens if a church can support a man to commit his time to serve the church unburdened by another job it should speaking for myself I trust the other elders would sell the same say the same I feel very well cared for well supported so thank you genuinely thankful to not need other work now we could move on if Paul hadn't added some spice here to the mix in verse 7 he goes from paying your pastors to say that this is a matter of mocking God how is that two reasons first true preachers preach the true gospel the reason Paul is writing this letter in the first place do you remember the good why the Galatians were in this mess to begin with they didn't have anybody capably teaching them the word and correcting what the false teachers were saying so what happened they abandoned the gospel they started to go after a salvation by works if they had had somebody teaching them identifying removing wolves would have been much better off even with pastors all kinds of stuff sprouts up in churches as it is how much more then when there is no regular diet of the true gospel feeding a church that's obviously made harder when a church will not support a teacher on the other side how much good has come from generation after generation of churches all over the world supporting preachers to preach the gospel if you're a Christian unless you met Jesus in a dream or a burning bush you can trace your conversion back to some preacher somewhere who preached the gospel to you or your parents or your grandparents or your young life leader or your coach or your doctor or your friend at some point and he used that to save you that's how the words been spreading since the book of Acts the preservation of the gospel is strengthened when churches support gospel preachers we pray God uses that to bless generations of people part of this church the second reason Paul says connects it to this could be mocking God or not is because money shows what we value doesn't it Paul's using farming in imagery here reaping and sowing he's using it on purpose it's very familiar image to his audience and it's also very reasonable like a farmer can reasonably expect to reap what he sows Paul's not saying something really radical in fact the common practice for school in the Roman Empire and in that time was for students or their families to pay their teachers directly even sometimes house them teachers were highly esteemed education was highly esteemed the best teachers were sometimes even put on retainer by wealthy families if you didn't pay you would not be taught so imagine a family who could afford the cost of a teacher yet choosing to just try to sneak their kid into the classroom how would the teacher feel he'd feel mocked he'd feel insulted if you don't value this enough to pay for it do you think I'd give it to you for free that's the sense that Paul is giving us here don't mock God if you can't afford gospel teaching that's one thing but if you can and you don't what should you expect you'll reap what you sow God knows too what we can reap and what we can sow the idea that maybe you've heard this we will keep the pastor poor God will keep them humble it's just straight-up unbiblical ends up being more harmful to the church than even the pastor that's fascinating we've preached at different times here that in different ways the prosperity gospel is a false gospel God does not promise us health or riches if we just have enough faith or give more money that's the kingdom of earth not of heaven and yet when it comes to church health Paul applies this give little get little give more get more principle but you probably know of course many pastors maybe who've abused church finances the internet is full of stories of this God knows also and even in that way he will not be mocked we see what that looks like as we look at the rest of our passage the law of Christ requires to do good to fellow sinners sufferers shepherds number four in view of eternity verse 8 through 10 for the one who sows to his own flesh will reap from the flesh will from the flesh reap corruption but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life let us not grow weary of doing good for in due season we will reap if we do not give up so then as we have opportunity let us do good to everyone and especially to those who are of the household of faith Paul sticks with the same farming imagery here but now he uses it more like how other parts of the Bible use farming imagery he uses it as a sign of judgment harvesting he's saying if we spend our lives sowing giving investing into what our flesh thinks is good we will reap corruption corruption there means decay or deterioration and we get a clear picture of what that means as he says the next thing if we sow and give and invest into what the Spirit thinks is good we will reap eternal life what must that mean corruption means eternal death Paul's saying that we pay for what we want that's that's just the rule of life in some way shape or form you pay for what you want and Paul saying you will in this regard you will get it in full we don't pay for what we don't want and we will not get it at all we can see how even these last few verses bear this out right if you don't support gospel preaching even when you can it shows that you probably don't care about the gospel being preserved in your church which means that you don't care about the gospel being preserved in your brothers and sisters which implies that you don't care about the gospel being preserved in your own heart which means that you are probably not walking by the Spirit which implies that you are probably walking in the flesh which will result in you knowing decay and destruction and corruption and the worthlessness of having wasted your life on the things of this world I hope that's not us I hope that's not me my hope is rather much rather that we'd hear that soberly and go about verse 9 and 10 look back at 9 and 10 do not grow weary of doing good for in due season we will reap if we do not give up so then as we have opportunity let us do good to everyone and especially to those who are of the household of faith brothers and sisters if we continue on if we live out the law of Christ seeing and enjoying who Christ is to us if we come alongside one another if we restore one another if we bear one another's burdens if we are not arrogant to each other if we put our money and our time into what matters most in this life God promises we will reap it all back Jesus says it even more strongly in Mark 10 truly I say to you there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands for my sake and for the gospel who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions and in the age to come eternal life saying whoever's left anything lost anything or anyone for his sake and the sake of the gospel they will receive a hundredfold back now and in the age to come eternal life do you know what that now looks like when family denies you for your faith it's a new family when faithfulness costs you property or work it's brothers and sisters bearing your burdens fulfilling the law of Christ unto you and in the last day when the harvest comes when those who've sowed to the flesh are separated from those who've sowed to the Spirit Jesus will welcome you to your reward life with no more sin to be restored from no more burdens for others to bear brothers sisters do not give up keep fulfilling the law of Christ especially to this household of faith in due season you will reap all all and more of what you've sown let's pray father we thank you for your promises your assurances and for your own example that you only call us to follow and copy you not try to chart our own path of righteousness not try to figure out what it looks like to walk by the Spirit we see you so father we ask that you would more and more bring the scales off of our eyes that we would see the risen Christ who you have united us with and feed on what he is like that we might strengthen and love those you've put around us use your word use this body to do so in Christ's name amen
