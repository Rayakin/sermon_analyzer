We're at the very end of Galatians. Galatians 6, 11 to 18, as Christina read for us. And this is literally his conclusion, if you can tell from the reading. And if you're familiar with the rest of Paul's letters, particularly the conclusions, you might notice that this is kind of a different way to end a letter for Paul. His other letters end with cordial personal greetings. So-and-so says, hi, I'm about to send so-and-so back to you. He almost died getting here. Grace and peace, can't wait to see you again. It's very kind. This one, this conclusion is not like that. It's longer than his usual conclusions, but there's no personal greeting, no doxology. Instead, he seems to get more urgent, more loud, almost grouchy, like an old man. He tells you the things he's been through. He throws that in there. Makes him feel worse as he ends. Well, that would be fitting for the kind of letter that this has been. The letter to the Galatians has not been a happy one for Paul to write. I don't know if you've ever had to write a letter to somebody that you love, that you had to warn, based on what you've seen the direction of their life becoming. You have to be clear about your care for them, but also clear about the problems that you see. It's not easy, even painful. Painful to even relive those things as you write, that kind of thing. That's probably what this letter felt like for Paul. And he ends this six chapter letter by returning to the subject that got him so bothered, so worked up in the first place. The subject of circumcision. So I'll spend a few minutes revisiting that, kind of as a way to reintroduce us to the letter itself, one last time, and then we'll look at our passage itself. Circumcision. What is the problem with circumcision? You might argue there are many problems with circumcision, but in Paul's mind, what is the problem with circumcision? The problem was that these churches in Galatia were being swayed by these Jewish folks called Judaizers. And they taught them that in order to be really forgiven of your sin, you had to accept that Jesus died for you, and also adopt Jewish practices. You also had to obey certain Jewish laws, practices like circumcision. Now to us, when we hear that, that might sound like an obvious wrong move, a no-brainer. But that's likely because we have letters like the letter to the Galatians, that we've read these things, we've read the rest of the New Testament. That's why we think that that's obviously the wrong thing to do. The Galatians did not have that, at least not until Paul signed it and sent it over. And according to the verses just above our passage, it's not even clear that the Galatians had a pastor preaching to them regularly. So, all that we are certain that they had, was that they had the gospel that Paul preached them a few years earlier when he planted the churches. And now whatever these false teachers are telling them, that's what they have. And these false teachers are making a good case for getting circumcised. What could they have said? What could they have possibly said to convince these people to be circumcised? Well, if you've been with us through Genesis, this might sound familiar. Circumcision, as we've seen, is the sign that God gave Abraham for the covenant that he was making with him and him only. The covenant, the promises that he was going to make Abraham a great nation, descendants as many as the stars in the sky, he'll be their God, the people will be his people. Extraordinary promises, amazing things to receive, amazing things to hear. Then what happens? A whole lot of nothing. Nothing for years. Years become decades. Understandably, they have their doubts along the way. They try to get creative along the way. Abraham lies. Sarah laughs. Hagar is sadly used. But God remains unfazed. God is not late. He is not forgotten. This is all just playing up, the drama, really. All those years, all their sin is just making it more and more plain that if God is going to do anything about those promises that he said, he will have to do it entirely on his own. No human work will help. No human work will bring it about. It will all be, have to be, God. And of course, as we know, one day, at a spry 100 and 90 years old, respectively, Abraham and Sarah Baer give birth to their miraculous son, Isaac. And on his eighth day, what does Abraham do? Abraham circumcises Isaac. Can you imagine the emotions of that moment? You're 100 years old. You've been waiting decades and decades for this. Finally, it's happened. You're administering to this miracle child the sign that God gave you, the promise that God's going to set you and your people apart. You do this, and you start to actually remember, believe, that God's really going to do the stuff that he said. This is going to come true after all. And from that moment on, generation after generation after generation of Jewish boys have received the same sign, the same symbol of hope, that they're to be part of God's own nation and people. There's something kind of awesome about that, this sign that you're part of something bigger than you, that your family is bigger than just your parents and your siblings, that God himself talked and set you apart, had you in mind. And yet, Galatians 5, 2. Look, I, Paul, say to you that if you accept circumcision, Christ will be of no advantage to you. What gives, Paul? Paul, former Jew of Jews, now going back on everything that he'd learned, that he'd taught, that he'd fought for, that he'd imprisoned people over, that amazing thing that Abraham waited so long for and was now unfolding dramatically throughout Jewish history, if you accept that, Christ is nothing to you. What gives is that Paul knows the truth about how Abraham received those promises, the truth that's echoed from Genesis through the Old Testament through the rest of the entire Bible, that God's promises, what has Matt been saying the promises are? Promises of three things, people, place, blessing. These blessings of God, these promises of God, are received only and entirely by what? By faith. Not by circumcision. By faith. Obviously, their own story echoes this, doesn't it? It illustrates this. Nothing Abraham or Sarah tried was the answer. At the end of the day, all they could do was believe. All they could do was wait. Believe that God will do what he says he will do. So, Genesis 15. Abraham believed and it was counted to him as righteousness. No human work would bring this about. So what does all that mean for circumcision? It means that circumcision is not how you get God's promises. It means that no human work that you do or that anybody does is how God's promises get to you. Not for Abraham, not for anybody. All circumcision is is a sign for the thing that does get you those promises. A heart of faith. Spiritual circumcision. And so, with that, Paul revisits that subject one last time. And here he uses an idea that he hasn't used until now. The idea of boasting. He uses boasting to make his point. And if we were to sum up in one sentence the idea of the passage. We can boast in the flesh and it will count for nothing. So boast in the cross. We can boast in the flesh. We can and we do and we will. It will count for nothing. So boast in the cross. So the two points will be those two things. We can boast in the flesh and it will count for nothing. Number one. Number two. So boast in the cross. Number one. First point. We can boast in the flesh and it will count for nothing. Verse 11. See with what large letters I'm writing to you with my own hand. It is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh who would force you to be circumcised. And only in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. For even those who are circumcised do not themselves keep the law, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh. Paul decides to close his letter by taking the pen himself. He would normally have had an assistant writing down the different things he was writing. But maybe he's a little too agitated or the guy's writing too slow. He grabs the quill and almost like a child would, just starts drawing bigger, writing bigger letters. Greek doesn't have capitals, so it's just literally bigger characters. Look what large letters I'm using. The first thing he mentions with these large letters is why the false teachers taught circumcision in the first place. This is an interesting thing to think about. Why did they even do this? Pretty intense thing to teach, if you'd agree. Pretty intense thing to insist on. Sure, they believed in this, that's why they taught this. But there's something else, according to Paul, that's motivating them. Something else that really is in their gut, what's pushing them to do this. They taught circumcision to look impressive. And by looking impressive, they would avoid persecution. Verse 12, it's those who want to make a good showing in the flesh who force you to be circumcised. Only in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. Circumcising the Galatians made them look impressive, spiritually, religiously impressive in the flesh. Pretty good plan. Okay, so impressive to who? Persecuted by who? Who are these other people that they wanted to show off for? This made them look impressive to these stricter Jews that were there at the time, more full-on Jews. They did not believe, like the Judaizers did, that Jesus was a kind of Messiah. They did not believe that Gentiles could be part of the family. They believed Jesus was just a troublemaker, Gentiles were just unclean. So even just the fact that the false teachers were hanging out with Gentiles made them frauds to the Jewish people. And so, to avoid being looked down upon by these stricter Jews, the Judaizers, they start pushing circumcision on these Galatians, and that makes them look a little more legit. Guys, we're only hanging out with these Christians to make them more Jewish like us. We're even getting them circumcised, man. That's how much we follow Moses. That's how Jewish we are. All this, even though, verse 13, Paul says they can't keep the law themselves. Paul has said earlier in the letter, no one can keep the law. And yet they kept enforcing it. Why? They keep enforcing it because that's how they get what they really want. What they really want is to look impressive, be approved, avoid persecution. What they really want is to be counted righteous in man's eyes. What they really want is to be counted righteous in the flesh. That's the salvation they want in their gut. The approval of man. The end of verse 13. They desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh. Here's the key distinction. It's not the circumcisions in themselves that matter. It's what the circumcisions did for them. It's how the circumcisions made them look to others. The more Galatians they circumcised, the more for real they'd appear to the Jews. You see the difference? It's not what the thing was. It's what the thing got them. In other words, the Judaizer, the false teacher's actual religion, wasn't this mixture of Judaism and Christianity. That's how it presented. But what Paul is exposing is that their true functional religion, the actual interest of their hearts, their boast, is in appearing religious in the flesh. Their religion is appearing religious. Because by appearing religious, they get what they really want in their heart of hearts. The approval of man. See how that works? You practice your religion, whatever it is, in this case, appearing religious. You practice your religion, why? To get salvation. What is their salvation? The approval of man. That's what religions do. That's what religions produce. That's why we buy into things like that. To get what we want. To get something we need. So what's that have to do with us today? It matters to us today in this way. In many ways, but in this way. No matter how Christian we say we are, we too can boast in things of the flesh that will not actually save us. No matter how Christian you say you are, think you are, project that you are, your heart may be committed to things of the flesh that will end up doing nothing for you. The Judaizers boasted in their religious appearance. What did that get them? Got them approval. Got them respect. Got them nothing before God. They taught the Galatians to be circumcised. What did circumcision get the Galatians? A sense of approval. A sense of belonging to the Jewish family. And absolutely nothing before God. That has been what Paul's been concerned about this whole time. His problem, Paul's problem isn't with the law itself. He spends like the middle of the letter defending why the law was necessary. That the law had a purpose from God himself. His problem isn't with the law. His problem isn't with circumcision either. He says in chapter 5 and he says again in our text, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision count for anything. His problem is that our hearts are prone to take any works of the flesh. Anything that we can say, I did. Anything that we can put our name on. And hold those things up as reasons that God should favor us. That's what sinful hearts do. We look for things to, we kind of know we don't have it all together ourselves. So we look for things that produce, that we produce. Things that we maybe improve around us. Things that we help with. God look, I'm good now, right? I was maybe at like an 85, round me up. So we have to ask, what do you boast in? What are you proud of? I trust most of us don't go walking around telling people how amazing we are. But I do imagine all of us at some point walk around thinking it. And not like you're proud of a meal you made or proud of a project you completed at work. What you boast in is the part of you that feeds on the fact that you made a great meal. It feeds on the fact that you did that project, that job. You see the difference? What you boast in is what you use to compare yourself to others. Especially what you use to make yourself feel secure in front of others. In short, what you boast in is your glory. Your honor. What is that for you? Your wealth? Your resume. Your intellect. Your appearance. Your religiousness. Your good behavior. Your helpfulness to others. Your social skills. Your being part of a serious church like this. My being a pastor of a church like this. Brothers and sisters, before men you may make a good showing in the flesh in all those ways. But before God, boasting in your flesh counts for nothing. And the more you boast in your flesh, the more desensitized you'll be to how the cross was necessary for even you. Even wonderful, impressive you needed the cross. So how do we stop? How do we keep from boasting in the flesh? We boast in the cross. Number two. Verse 14. But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me and I to the world. For neither circumcision counts for anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation. And as for all who walk by this rule, peace and mercy be upon them and upon the Israel of God. From now on, let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen. Again, it feels a little grave, a little heavy for a goodbye. But if he caught that at the end, it becomes rather poignant, actually. The last word before amen is that he calls them brothers. He never does that. He never concludes a letter by calling any of the former church's brothers. He calls them brothers in other parts of the letter, but here he makes a point to finish. Last word, brothers. Which is interesting. Earlier in the letter he'd written that he might have labored over them in vain. But he also says that he's confident that they will not fall away at the end. He's confident enough to call them brothers. Paul only ever uses brothers to talk about fellow believers, and he certainly isn't one to just throw around labels like that. May we be similarly hopeful toward one another. May we similarly see the stronger hand of God. May we similarly have patience and compassion toward one another, particularly those who might be swayed or momentarily weak, tossed by some strange doctrine. It happens, it will happen, perhaps even to you. May we be a body that will receive that and help one another through it. Whatever patience, whatever compassion he had for the Galatians, he does not have for the false teachers. He writes here to contrast himself with them. They boasted in their flesh they were happy to appear religious for the sake of impressing others, avoiding persecution. They got what they wanted. They will not have God. And Paul, knowing this, he says what might be one of the most encompassing statements you can say about the flesh, the worthlessness of the flesh. Verse 14. But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me and I to the world. What does he mean? First, we need to remember that there weren't like cross necklaces at this time. Nobody was getting cross tattoos. The cross was a picture of brutality. The cross meant a hard and absolute death. Romans even avoided saying cross or crucifixion. They'd say things like, and he was hanged by the unlucky tree. Because it was so horrid, gruesome. So it's striking, isn't it? That Paul says, far be it from me to boast in anything except that grotesque thing. Boast in the most shameful picture that humanity can experience. Why does he say this? Why not something like nice, like the resurrection? It had happened. Because it's at the cross that all boasting in the flesh dies. Because no one can stand before the cross with their accolades, with their abilities. No one can take all that stuff and stand in front of the cross and still think this stuff's important. You can see the son of God hanging for your sins and still think that you have something to boast in yourself. Your sin held him there, as we saw. You see the horror. You see the shame. And it's that, it's through that, that you realize how the cross can actually, in fact, be boasted in. Because you see that it is that gruesome thing, that wild juxtaposition of the son of God, perfection incarnate, attached to an instrument of torture and death for the worst of the worst. When you see those things come together, you see that that and that alone could have the power to empty you of all your other boasts. All of your self-righteousness. It does what the world and all of its boasts could never do. The world, when Paul writes this, the world means the old ways of self-righteousness, the ways of boasting in the flesh. It's at the cross that we realize how foolish the boasts of the world are. In its horror, the cross is stunning beauty, isn't it? In its pain, the cross is utter comfort to us, isn't it? In its shame, it is unspeakable glory to us, isn't it? The son of God bleeding for you and me. Think about that. The world has nothing that strong. The world has nothing that strong. Which means then, when we see it aright, it's not that the cross is shameful, but the world that's shameful. As the cross empties us of our boasts, it empties also the world of its power over us. As Paul says, we are dead to it. It is dead to us. You've heard people say about people they've maybe had a falling out with, they're dead to me. Pretty cold thing to say about a person. But that is the idea that Paul is using here. The world, dead to me. Me, dead to the world. We have nothing to do with each other. We need nothing from one another now. We gain nothing from one another now. At the cross, all the self-righteous ways of the world were judged sinful and punished in full. And so the world took Paul and all of us down. We were crucified to the world. But also at the cross, the world, the entire system of man boasting in himself, that entire system was also brought down. What does that mean? The old world is over. Paul's been hinting at this in different points through this letter. We are now in a new age. A new era has begun. What I mean is, have you understood this? Not that you, not have you had a total release from the world. Not have you never had any more temptations to boast in the flesh. May God progress that in each of us. What I mean is, have you stood before the cross? When is the last time in your spirit you stood before the cross of Jesus? Have you come and brought all of your boasts and felt them lose their luster in the light of the cross? Have you found Jesus to be actually wonderful? Not just in name, not just in he ought to be. Have you found him to be wonderful? Friends, he is far more wonderful than you know. He's more hope-giving than you, whatever you hope in. He's more praiseworthy than what you boast in. He's more lovely than whatever you yearn for. Go to him for the first time or the 10,000th time. With all your sins, with all of your boasts, see how he compares to what you bring. What you'll find is in verse 15, that neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation. You'll find that the old world of boasting in the flesh is over and a new one has begun. Paul said a similar thing in chapter 5. One author put it this way. It's hard to imagine a more un-Jewish statement than neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything. There's nothing more un-Jewish than to say that. Which is very much the point, isn't it? The new creation is not ordered according to Jewishness or any human law or any human creed or any human activity. The new world is not enchanted by any of the world's ways. It boasts in a cross. The new creation is not ordered by anything that might breed self-righteousness. The new creation is ruled by a lion who is also a slain lamb. The new age has begun under Christ's watch. The kingdom of heaven is now here, as Jesus said in his own words. It's what Paul mentions at the beginning of the letter, chapter 1, verse 3. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself for our sins to deliver us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father. He keeps going in this direction, keeps scraping against the old world. Verse 16. And as for all who walk by this rule, peace and mercy be upon them and upon the Israel of God. I mean, he's just like having fun now. He knows what he's doing. The Israel of God? The Israel of God is him restating what he'd said a couple chapters earlier. That the true Israel, the true people of God, the true sons of Abraham are those who are sons not by the flesh, but by faith, which includes all these Gentiles, all these Galatians around them. Old world, the old creation would not have abided that. The new creation is populated by every tribe and tongue. Finally, one more result of boasting in the cross as he closes. Verse 17. From now on, let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen. Verse 17 is striking. Maybe you've heard that before, read that before. Paul is talking about his physical wounds. He's talking about the scars that would have been visible to anybody. He may have specifically been referring to the most recent time he was stoned. Paul is stoned multiple times in his ministry. He was stoned in Acts 14. The timeline might sync up to that. If his readers needed any proof of whether Paul was for real, whether he's just giving lip service to the cross, he bears the marks of his faith on his body. He's been through it. He has withstood it. He has defended it. He has not recanted. On top of that, at the time it was common for slaves to be branded with the marks of their owner. That's how they would have designated them. These are the marks of my master. And so in a different way, in an additional way, Paul scars. They don't just show what he's been through in the name of the cross. They show that he belongs to the one whose body was marked for him. He's not just under Christ. He's not just enduring for Christ. He's also, in his suffering, fulfilling Christ's own suffering in his body, which is the wildest contrast between him and the false teachers. False teachers boasted in avoiding persecution. Paul boasted in the cross. And so he accepted persecution as part of the new creation, as part of life coming not by the flesh, but by a lion and a slain lamb. Paul understood. And we need to remember that. We need to remember that today. We can just look at verse 17 and just think, okay, mic drop moment for Paul, point for Paul, be in awe of him. That's at least that. But we need to follow him. How did he get there? How did he think this was the better way to live? We need to see for ourselves that he's not crazy. We need to see for ourselves that a persecuted life under the cross is truly better than a comfortable life of the flesh. It may not come for us with stones and whips, but we should ask in what ways do we bear the marks of Jesus at all? Is anything visible about us that speaks of God's ownership over us, that we're belonging, we belong to a man who was marked on our behalf? How about our calendars? Would our calendars bear the marks of Jesus? Our bank statements, would they perhaps show the marks of Jesus? It's worth asking, praying, even discussing with others, are the marks of Jesus evident in my life? Is my boasting in him evidenced by my living like him? It would be worth talking about. Because the less that's the case for us, the less compelling our witness will be, and the less natural it will seem when we actually try to live sacrificially in Christ's footsteps. Do you see that? We'd be getting it backwards. One author illustrated it this way. It's all too common for Christ to be seen, not as the center of attention and himself the key to life's meaning, but as a figure, sometimes a very smudgy figure, brought in as the answer to some preset egocentric questions of our own. How may I find peace of conscience, peace of heart and mind when under pressure, happiness, joy, power for living? The necessity of faithful discipleship to Jesus and the demands of it are not stressed, and so the cost of following Jesus is never counted. As a consequence, our churches reap large crops of still unconverted folk who think they can cast Jesus for the role of butler, calling him in and making use of him as savior and helper, while declining to have him as Lord. These become dead wood in our churches, even if they do not drift away entirely. Brothers and sisters, do realize how impactful your boasting can be, in either direction. What easily animates you and what does not? That has an impact on us. We can boast in the flesh and it will count for nothing, so let us boast in the cross. As Isaac Watts, as I close, as he wrote in 1707, it's almost like he based these verses on this passage, I'll read it in full, plus a verse I didn't know existed. When I survey the wondrous cross, on which the Prince of Glory died, my richest gain I count but loss, and pour contempt on all my pride. Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast, save in the death of Christ my God. All the vain things that charm me most, I sacrifice them to his blood. See from his head, his hands, his feet, sorrow and love flow mingled down. Did e'er such love and sorrow meet, or thorns compose so rich a crown? His dying crimson, like a robe, spreads o'er his body on the tree. Then am I dead to all the globe, and all the globe is dead to me. Were the whole realm of nature mine, that were an offering far too small. Love, so amazing, so divine, demands my soul, my life, my all. Let's pray. Father, we ask that you would graciously remove scales from our eyes, some perhaps for the first time, and for the rest of us, these things that cling, these things that we can't help but keep, esteeming, valuing, chasing, when we need not, when we know they do nothing for us in your sight, that all of our justification has been provided by your Son on the cross. We need only believe. God, teach us how to live in light of the gospel. Teach us how, show us how the gospel itself shows us how to live, not just as a piece of data we have, we keep in our minds and pockets. Teach us about life through your word. Thank you. Thank you for your Spirit who enlivens us, who gives us ears to hear. Would you do that work even more in us, that we might hear you and follow you more closely. In Christ's name, amen.
