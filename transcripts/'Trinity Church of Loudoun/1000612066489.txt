This unique laughter that comes in the middle of something traumatic, like a splinter, where you realize and you witness and you feel, oh, it's going to be okay. They did it. It's gone. I'm going to live. And you laugh. Laughter is a powerful thing. In life's most vulnerable moments, we cry and we laugh. If you have your Bible, turn with me to Genesis chapter 21, where we continue our series through the book of Genesis. And the story this morning, Genesis 21, is a story of promises. The whole book is a book of promises. We've been tracing promises, people, place, blessing, people, place, blessing. And this morning, the story is a story of fulfillment, and it's also a story of laughter. If I could summarize for you this morning, before we even look more carefully at this passage, the main point of this passage, it would be something like this. Rejoice, or I might even say from this passage, laugh because God keeps and protects His promises. Rejoice because God keeps and protects His promises. Laugh because God keeps and protects His promises. That's what I want to show you this morning. First, rejoice for God keeps His promises. And for this, we'll look at the first episode, the first scene, verses 1 through 7. And then secondly, rejoice for God protects His promises. And for that, we'll look at the second scene, verses 8 through 21. So, let's dive into this passage. And first, first scene, rejoice for God keeps His promises. At this point in the story of Genesis, there are only three people that we know of who have been given from God the status of righteous. Only three people in the story have been declared, here or later, as righteous. Abraham and Sarah and Abraham's nephew, Lot. For all we know, that's all of the human population upon the earth that God has looked from heaven and declared, okay, blessed, saved, because righteous. Lot, one of the three, barely made it out of Sodom alive the last time we saw him. He now lives in a cave outside of town and has impregnated his own daughters in consecutive nights of blackout drunkenness. And Abraham and Sarah, numbers 2 and 3, have just returned to their old ways in the last chapter, in the previous scene, their old ways of trickery with foreign kings, pretending to be brother and sister, proving once again that they are fundamentally liars. Things are really bleak right now in Genesis as we arrive to chapter 21. The only righteous ones on the earth are all utterly failing. These are dark days. And verse 1 says, look at verse 1, the Lord visited Sarah. The Lord visited Sarah. The word here, visited, is a big word in Genesis and in the whole story of the Bible. It means to intervene, to pierce through, to draw near, to come through on behalf of something or someone. It's the same word used later in the Bible in 1 Samuel 2 21, where we read that the Lord visited Hannah, and thus Hannah, who up to this point was barren like Sarah, bore three sons and two daughters. Why? Because the Lord visited her. We serve a God who opens and closes wombs, who interrupts and intervenes into human history to accomplish his purposes, a God who visited Sarah, and a God who will visit you to supply you exactly the grace you need and I need. The Lord visited Sarah, we read, as he had said, and the Lord did to Sarah as he had promised. It's been 25 years since that promise for a child was first made. Now think about that before we land on the arrival and the fulfillment of this promise. 25 years. 25 years ago this morning, as I'm preaching, as you're hearing me preach, 25 years ago, Bill Clinton was in office. 25 years ago, Bill Clinton was impeached in the office of the president. 25 years ago, Mark McGuire hit 70 home runs, juiced up. I really think they should bring steroids back to baseball. We've all lost interest in baseball ever since they got rid of steroids. 25 years ago, baseball was much better. 25 years ago, two random students at Stanford founded a new site, an engine called Google. 25 years ago, many of you were not born. That's how long ago, 25 years ago. 25 years ago, Sarah was 65 years old when the Lord promised her a child. Abraham was 75 years old and they thought the promise was ridiculous then. Sarah's 90 now. Abraham's 100. And Paul says in Romans 4 that their bodies at this moment were as good as dead. And after 25 years of waiting and 25 years of taking matters into their own hands and 25 years of forgetting and giving up and backsliding and moving on and just settling on Ishmael, Sarah started to get morning sickness, nausea. And at 89 years old, Sarah had a baby bump and the bump got bigger. Then they were screaming and crying and pushing. And verse 2 says Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age at the time of which God has spoken to him. 25 years. And 25 years later, the long-awaited birth is here. And I want you to notice two things which Moses emphasizes for us here with respect to this birth. Two things. First of all, God always keeps his word. Do you see this in the passage? Look at the passage carefully. Verse 1. Watch how Moses emphasizes this. Verse 1. The Lord visited Sarah as he had said. Verse 1 continues. And the Lord did to Sarah as he had promised. Verse 2. And Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age at the time of which God had spoken to him. Do you see what Moses is emphasizing here? Why did this happen? Why were these promises being fulfilled? One reason. Because God said it was going to happen. God promised it would happen and God always keeps his promises. Amen? Abraham has disobeyed, doubted, laughed, strayed, and moved on. But God never lies. What if some were unfaithful? Does their faithlessness nullify the promises of God? By no means. Let God be proved true, though every man a liar. Romans 3. God always keeps his promises. That's what Moses wants you to see here. I wonder what promise of God you've just sort of given up on and stopped waiting on. You waited for a while. You prayed. You repeated for a while. And now you've stopped waiting for it and turned to other means and tried to figure it out and figure this out your own way, in your own strength, in your own flesh. Wait on God. He always keeps his promises. He always keeps his word. Second thing I think Moses wants you to notice and I want you to notice is Abraham and Sarah's response to the fulfillment of this promise. Look at verse 3. Verse 3 and verses 4 say, Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore him, Isaac. And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old as God had commanded him. What are we witnessing here? Back in chapter 17, God had commanded Abraham, who was now in that chapter, as of that chapter, his covenant friend. God entered into covenant with Abraham and then commanded him to name the child of the promise Isaac, which means laughter. And then after commanding him to name him Isaac, he further commanded him to circumcise his son on the eighth day along with all those generations who come after him. Abraham here, chapter 21, gave the boy the name God had assigned him. And Abraham here in chapter 21 had the boy circumcised on the eighth day exactly as God had commanded him. Abraham and Sarah, here's what I want you to see. They obeyed God. God came through in his word. He fulfilled his promise. And Abraham and Sarah immediately and exactly and fully obeyed God. Now listen, Genesis has already told us that Abraham was counted righteous by God. Genesis 15, 6, on account of what? Come on, his faith. This is what Paul picks up on in Romans and says, this is how anyone is justified or counted righteous, by faith. But what we're seeing here is Abraham's faith in action. Faith obeys. Faith always obeys. Abraham here obeys God's word because that's what the faithful do. Saving faith obeys. It falls down. Thank God for this witness, this testimony of Abraham who falls down and then falls down again and then rolls backwards a few times because this gives us hope as ones who also fall down. Faith falls down. It doubts. It wavers. It struggles for a season. But it always in the end obeys and obeys entirely and exactly. If you're here this morning and you claim to be a Christian, you claim to believe in God, to have faith in God. Let me ask you a question. Do you obey God? And is there any area of your life where you will not obey God? Now notice I did not say, is there any area of your life where you have not obeyed God? Because the answer to that for all of us, if we're honest, would of course be yes. Time and time again, we disobey God in all kinds of areas of our lives. And I'm just talking about this morning before we got to church. Of course, we always struggle to obey God. But is there any area of your life where you will not obey God? If there's some area of your life, of my life, where we will just not let go and go with God, where His Word has clearly spoken, where you or I refuse to give something up and obey God, that is not faith. And you have no reason, if that's you, to be assured that you're a Christian. The Christian must repent. And we fall down, we stumble, we repent, and we repent again. But we do repent. We do turn from our sins. Christians are not all well. But Christians are all in. Do you see? Are you all in? Obeying Jesus, whatever His Word says, whatever God's Word says, that's faith. And that's what we see in Abraham here. And Sarah as well. There's one other thing in their response that I want you to consider before we move on to the second scene. And that is their laughter. Look at verse 5. Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. And Sarah said, watch Sarah. We've journeyed with Sarah quite a bit through this story too. Watch Sarah's response here after she's had the child. God has made laughter for me. Everyone who hears will laugh over me. And she said, who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have born him a son in his old age. God, she says, God has made laughter for me. Everyone who hears of this story, everyone who hears will laugh over me. Laughter, I wonder if you've noticed, laughter has been a big thing in Genesis so far. From one angle, it's sort of been its own story, if you've been paying attention, the story of laughter. Let me just briefly recount for you. In chapter 17, God first told Abraham that the heir, the heir of the promise and the recipient of the blessings from which the nation's going to come, is not going to be some household servant. It's going to be Abraham's own loins. It's going to biologically be Abraham's child, Sarah's child. And then we read, chapter 17, verse 17, that Abraham fell on his face and laughed and said to himself, shall a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? Shall Sarah, who is 90 years old, bear a child? That was chapter 17. God responded by saying, yes, watch this, yes, Sarah will bear you a son, shall bear you a son, and you shall name him Isaac. Now Isaac, we're so used to that name. Do we have any Isaacs in the room? How many of you have a relative name or a good friend named Isaac? Lots of us, right? Lots of us. We know Isaac. We take it for granted. That's because Hebrew is not an original language to us. He was literally named, he laughs. Laughter. God did that in an ironic twist over Abraham's response to the promise. Abraham fell on his face laughing. God said, all right, you name him laughter. So God made him, commanded him to name this child laughter, but we're not done with this story of laughter. Chapter 18, God came back and said, this time next year, he's going to be here. It's time. And then we read this. Sarah, chapter 18, verse 12. Sarah laughed to herself, saying, after I'm worn out and my Lord Abraham is old, shall I have pleasure then? Sarah laughs at the promise of God. So God confronts Abraham over her. Remember what God says? Why did Sarah just laugh? He says, verse 13, Sarah denies it. Scoundrels. I didn't laugh. Not me. Verse 15, God confirmed and confronted once again. Yes, Sarah, but you did laugh. It's a story of laughter, do you see? Laughter everywhere. Mostly bad laughter. Mostly the laughter of unbelief. But what's Sarah laughing at now? This is critical. What's everybody, as Sarah prophesies here, what's everybody laughing at over Sarah and at her expense? Everybody's now laughing at the shocking goodness of God, who came through after all. He actually did it. He actually kept this absurd promise. And so she says, God has made laughter for me. Everyone who hears will laugh over me. So ridiculous promise and 25 years and famine and two harems. Sarah's been given over to a Pharaoh and a king and a mistress and a son out of wedlock and a son outside of God's promise and sinful laughter and rebuke and a denial. So many lies in the story and now old age and wrinkles and joint pains and arthritis. And now the baby is screaming. Her body hurts even worse and she's just laughing. Laughing at all of us. I imagine with tears mixed in to her laughter as well, laughing at her age, laughing at her doubts, laughing at the obstacles, which yesterday, 10 years ago, 15 years ago, 20 years ago, the obstacles which were so big and so impossible, laughing at them now, laughing at her laughter, laughing at all the time and all the anxiety and all the missteps. Sarah here envisions everyone laughing and crying at the goodness of God. This is the first holy laughter in all the Bible. And then without comment, Moses just fast forwards years in the story, which brings us to scene two, where God's word invites us to rejoice for God not only keeps, but God protects his promises. So let's pick up in verse 8, where we read that the child, Isaac, grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. Ancient Hebrew children were weaned at two or three years old. So this is some time and even years later. This was a significant moment in the life of a Hebrew child. The child had survived infancy in a time where infant mortality rates were just insanely high. So this was a celebration, a great feast we read, especially for this child. This is the child of the promise. During the celebration, Sarah saw Abraham's other child, Ishmael, who by now was a late teenager. She saw him, look at verse 9, laughing at Isaac. Now here we go again with this story continuing now, the story of laughter. But the sense here, the sense of laughter is different. Ishmael is mocking, your translation may even have, mocking his younger half-brother. Paul in Galatians 4 verse 29 says of this scene that the child of the flesh, that is Ishmael, persecuted the child born according to the promise. Ishmael was persecuting God's man here, God's promised child with his laughter. And so Sarah steps in, mama bear comes out and comes in. She demands Abraham banish Hagar and Ishmael, for neither, she reminds Abraham, neither are the heir of the promise, verse 10 says. Abraham is distressed, you have to feel for Abraham here. Now he got himself into this mess, but this is his son. His sin, yes, his sin got us here, but it is his son. And so he's distressed, he's torn between wife and child. And what does he do here? He can't make this gut-wrenching decision, wife or son, until God steps in and intervenes once again. And tells Abraham, look at verse 12. Whatever Sarah says to you, do exactly as she tells you, for through Isaac shall your offspring be named. And I will make a nation of the son of the slave woman also, because he also, Ishmael, is your offspring. Sarah here, whatever her fault, and there are many, she is finally representing God's cause. And she is finally zeroed in on God's promise and promises related to her son. And so verse 14 says, so Abraham rose early in the morning, early in the morning. Notice again here, Abraham's immediate obedience, this is what faith does. It doesn't wait, it doesn't delay, it doesn't put one foot in and holds on to the rest. It immediately obeys. Abraham rose early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder along with the child, and sent her away. Hagar heads once again for the deadly desert. For the second time in the story, Hagar heads back home towards Egypt. Remember, Abraham had picked her up along with other possessions earlier in Genesis, when he was in Egypt fleeing from a famine. It's a treacherous journey through the desert wilderness, and there aren't markets or fountains for water. And so after a time, Hagar knows that she's done. And so she stops and she puts, verse 15, look at verse 15, she puts her expiring son in the bushes. And then she walks off to a safe distance, safe enough for her to not have to watch her son die. And then she lifted up her voice and she wept. Now this is the second time in the story, watch this, second time in the story that Hagar has been on the brink of death in the wilderness just outside of Egypt, and the second time in the story that the angel of the Lord comes to her. The first time he comes to her, do you remember what he says? Do you remember what she says in response to the angel? She says, you are a God of seeing. She names God Jehovah Rapha, the God of seeing. This time, the second time, the angel of the Lord comes again. And twice we read in verse 17 that God heard her, El Shema. She names God twice on account of Hagar, the Egyptian. Twice God receives covenant names, Jehovah Rapha, El Shema, the God who sees and the God who hears. And then the Lord comes to her and promises her that her child too will be made into a great nation. Then we read verse 19, that God opened her eyes. Then and at that moment, and she saw before her a well of water. Now, it's not clear, but the text reads like the well was right before her and she just somehow missed it. What exactly is going on here? She's, you know, she's feet away. Is she this, you know, famished and thirsty and tired? What exactly is going on here? I don't know, but I do know this, all throughout Scripture, this same sort of thing happens and it forms a pattern and it repeats itself over and over and over. Hagar weeps, cries out to God. God responds to her and her eyes come open and a well of water is right before her. The prophet Elisha in 2nd Kings chapter 6 goes out to war on the battlefield with the Syrians and he brings a servant boy with him and the servant is scared out of his britches. And so Elisha prays to God, God open his eyes, that scared servant boy, let him see. God answers, open his eyes and the servant boy sees that he and Elisha are surrounded by an army of angelic horses and chariots of fire before they go into battle. Jesus on the road to Emmaus after he dies, Luke 24, is walking with his disciples and talking for hours and they don't know who he is. They don't recognize their Lord and their friend who they've walked with and lived with until Jesus opens their eyes and they see, they saw that it was the Lord. Now, I know that's so bizarre, but in one way or the other, isn't that the story of every single Christian in the room? We knew Jesus. We heard his name a hundred times, a thousand times. We've heard and rehearsed the old, old stories of walking on water, of feeding the 5,000 with bread and fish, of the cross and of the empty tomb. We heard the story, but at some point or another, the scales dropped and we saw Jesus for the first time. And now we beheld his beauty and now we loved him. And now we wanted him, even if it meant we lost anything else. And why did that happen? Paul tells us why and how that happened, 2 Corinthians 4, 6. For God who said, let light shine out of darkness, the same creator God, has shown his light into our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ Jesus. Isn't that your story if you're a Christian? You saw. Hagar saw the well and she drank. The boy drank and they lived and the boy grew and grew stronger and became a warrior and took an Egyptian wife like his mother and he became the father of his own nation. Not the promised people, not the promised nation, but a nation of peoples who could share in the promise and find the same blessing if they'll trust in the promised Savior from that promised people. All because of God's grace, even to Ishmael the mocker. We see here two things and I want you to see two things. First of all, God is gracious to all, even those outside of the promise. God is gracious to all, even those outside of the promise. This is what theologians call common grace, the grace that God commonly shows to all mankind, to all of humanity, grace that God shows to everyone and everywhere. Billions of people woke up this morning rejecting God and rejecting his Savior, but they woke up and the sun shined and the rain replenished their lands and they have children and they have food and they have shelter and they have so many other blessings. Maybe that's some of you this morning experiencing God's common blessings, even though you haven't yet submitted to his son. And millions and billions of people presume upon the riches of his kindness, all these riches of his kindness, the rain, the food, children, laughter, and they think, they see those promises and they think, oh, look how God, if there is a God, is richly blessing me. I'm safe here and now. I'm happy here and now. Surely I'll be safe and happy forever in eternity, whatever eternity is. But that kindness, Romans 2, 4 says, is meant to lead them and lead all to repentance. If you don't repent, his kindness will expire. Ishmael became a great warrior and a great nation because of God's common grace. But what is that in comparison with an eternity in hell? Second thing I want you to see here from the second scene, God will protect this promise no matter the cost. God will protect this promise no matter the cost. This promise is about so much more, mind you, than a random old man and a random old woman and God doing something just really surprising and incredible. You've never seen a 90-year-old give birth to a baby. Neither have I. This promise is about so much more than that. This promise is everything. It's about that blessing. Genesis 12, God is giving to restore all of humanity, all the nations. It's about salvation. It's about God restoring a people to himself and for his name through this child. This child represents not just one promise, but all of God's promises, including the ultimate promise of another child. This one not born to an old woman on her deathbed. This one born to a little girl who was a virgin. Which do you think is more miraculous? This promise is about that promise and every promise. That's how Paul understood this passage when he wrote Galatians and reflected back on Genesis 21. So if you want to turn with me to Galatians, we're actually going to end here. Because Paul reflects in Galatians 4 on this scene and these two sons. And he draws out a lesson for us. And it's really the lesson of all lessons. So turn with me to Galatians 4 towards the back of your Bible. If you have a Bible. And let me pick up reading for you in verse 21. Galatians 4 21. Tell me you who desire to be under the law. Do you not listen to the law? For it is written that Abraham had two sons. One by a slave woman, Hagar, and one by a free woman, Sarah. But the son of the slave woman, Ishmael, was born according to the flesh. While the son of the free woman, Isaac, was born through promise. Now this may be interpreted allegorically. These women are two covenants. One, Hagar, is from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery. She is Hagar. Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia. She corresponds, she represents the present Jerusalem. For she is in slavery with her children. Now this is so hard because we don't know allegory. But let me just tell you quickly in summary what's happening here. Hagar, Ishmael, Paul says they are, they represent Mount Sinai. They are the law. They're all the commandments of God. They're the flesh. They are everybody in his day and in this room this morning. Everybody who is trusting in their own flesh. In law-keeping. And I'm a good person. I do good things to find God's blessing and God's salvation. Maybe that's you this morning. You think you're good enough. If that's you, you're under Ishmael's curse. But Paul goes on, Galatians 4, let me pick up in verse 28. Now you brothers, but you brothers and sisters, like Isaac, now he's speaking to the church. Like Isaac, you are children of the promise. But just as at that time, he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the spirit. So also it is now. But what does the scripture say? Cast out the slave woman and her son for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with the son of the free woman. So brothers and so sisters, we are not children of the slave, but of the free woman. Sarah, Isaac, Paul says, they're living according to the promise. They are. They represent the gospel. They represent grace and they represent everyone. I hope many of you this morning. They represent everybody who looks not to themselves, not to their own works or to their own obedience or law-keeping or anything else, but looks to Jesus, the fulfillment of every promise of God and our Savior. We're coming to the end of the Abraham and Sarah stories. And the promised child is now here. And so I want to say something in reflection on all we've seen for many chapters now. I want to say this. There will be people. Who are better people than Abraham. Or Sarah. Who will spend eternity in hell. There will be many people in hell forever who are better people than Abraham and Sarah. Think about it. Abraham's a liar and a deceiver. He's a terrible husband. He's given up his wife to kings to save himself at least twice. He's taken a mistress and fathered a son by her. Sarah, I mean, speaking of her, she's harsh, jealous. She laughed at God's word and then she lied about it. Many, most of you, most of us have a better resume than Abraham or Sarah. And yet if you died today, it's possible you could spend eternity in hell. This is what you must understand to understand the story of Abraham and Sarah and to understand the gospel. You look at Abraham and you think, well, that's God's guy. He got God's blessing. And I'm definitely better than he is. I'm better than she is. And you might be. And that's entirely missing the point of the story. I'm so confident that if Satan, this is weird, if the devil were preaching this passage this morning, that would be the point he'd want you to take away from this. That would be his main point in the sermon. Look at Abraham and Sarah. Worse than you. You're good. You have a better resume. Abraham was a wretch. Sarah was a wretch. And both were only saved on account of their faith. That's the point of the story. And I want to make sure before we begin wrapping it up today in the next few weeks that you get that once again and once for all. By faith, the author of Hebrews says, Abraham obeyed when he was called to go to a place that would be his inheritance. By faith, the author of Hebrews says, Abraham went to live in the land of promise. By faith, the author of Hebrews says, Sarah received the power to conceive since she considered him faithful who had promised. They died in faith, Abraham, Sarah and all the rest. They died in faith, the author of Hebrews says, not having received the things promised, but having seen them from afar and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth. It was his faith. And it will only be your faith when you stand before your creator and your judge. It will be faith and faith alone in the God of these promises. Or it will be banishment and eternal exile. Faith looking at your own resume, your Abraham, Sarah, David defeating resume and beating your own chest like the publican in Jesus' parable and crying out, God have mercy on me, a sinner. Your faith, my faith, showing itself and proving itself, demonstrating itself in obedience. It's faith and faith alone. You have to get that from this story. That's how Paul preached this story. It's faith and faith alone. It's faith which inherits the promises. It's faith which receives the blessing of salvation. And someday faith will turn to sight. And someday we will, each of us, if we've trusted in Christ alone and looked away from our own resumes, we will awake in glory and in resurrection. And I imagine in that day we will look back on it all. We will look back on everything, sin and death and loss and cancer and funerals and failures and folly and backsliding and doubts and kids who have strayed and broken hearts and broken marriages. I imagine we'll look back on it all. And I don't know if we'll cry, but I'm sure that we will laugh and rejoice and sing forever because God will have come through on every single promise because he always keeps his word and God will have made all things right and all things new. Amen. God, thank you for all your promises. Thank you for these promises of old, which you give us as stories to bolster our faith. Thank you for your promises to us that we are inheritors. We're heirs. We're co-heirs with Abraham, even co-heirs with the Lord Jesus Christ by faith of all the promises of eternity and more. And so, God, we pray you would give encouragement to your people as we weary on through this life and this world of suffering as pilgrims. And God, we pray you would remove the scales and give new sight and new vision to behold and love the Lord Jesus for those who have not yet trusted him. We pray all these things in Jesus name. Amen.
