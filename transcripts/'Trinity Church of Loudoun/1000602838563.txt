You can turn in your Bibles to Genesis 17, if you're not already there. At a previous job, when I was onboarded, my first week on the job, they hadn't yet made my key. And so I was temporarily given one of those master keys, which could unlock every door, every room, every office in the building. And I ended up keeping it the entire time I was there, because they forgot and I forgot. Now, I never used it, besides to unlock the building and unlock my office, which was convenient to have one key to open up both instead of two. But I could have used it if I wanted to, or if somebody gave me a reason to. I could have used it to open literally every single room in the entire operation. I think that the sermon that you're about to hear, and trigger warning, because I'm about to say something outrageous, I think the sermon that you're about to hear could be one of the more important sermons that you ever hear. Now, what I don't mean by that is I've just got this amazing sermon this morning that I feel really great. I feel just as terrible about this sermon as basically every sermon that I come up here to preach before you on Sunday mornings. Nor do I mean by that that this sermon is going to hit you, and I know it's going to hit you in a special way by the Spirit's power. Every week, one of the biggest joys of preaching is talking to people afterwards or during the week and hearing different random people talk about how the most random things have struck them in the heart by the Spirit of God. It's always a wonderful surprise. It's just God's Word and God does the work. You never know. So I don't mean anything like that. But I do mean by that, and what I do know is that our passage this morning, Genesis 17, is one of those passages that if I do my job, it sort of unlocks the message of the entire Bible. In that sense, this passage, Genesis 17, is one of those passages in the Bible that actually works sort of like a master key to the entire Bible. By using this passage, you can kind of unlock and get into so many other different rooms in the Bible, even rooms yet to be revealed, yet to be written as far as the Bible goes. God has now entered into a relationship with Abram and all of his descendants. We don't know them yet, but if you fast forward in the story, his descendants are the people of Israel. God has entered into a special relationship with Abram and his eventual descendants in Israel. And that relationship is built upon promises. And remember, review, I've been sort of quizzing you every single week. Get ready. God has especially made three big promises to Abram. Let's all say them together. People, place, blessing. Yes, people, place, and blessing. Over the last several weeks, I've been trying to drill that into you. You just heard how God has caused that to come to life in your hearts, and it's paid off drilling it in you. This morning, at long last, I hope to show you why I've been trying to drill that into you. People, place, and blessing. In our passage, that relationship between God and Abram and God and his descendants, Israel, and the covenant binding that relationship together. In our passage this morning, that relationship is sealed through the sign of circumcision. But here's what I want you to see by the end of our time this morning. You, too, can share in these promises made to Abraham. In fact, these promises made to Abraham are for you. And I'm going to show you how they can become yours and what it means for these promises to be yours using this master key of circumcision. But we've got a lot of careful work to do before we get there. So let's lock in this morning. If I could give you a little roadmap before we dive in. I'm going to show you three things about this covenant, which, again, will serve for us as a master key to unlocking the rest of the Bible and even how these promises are yours in Jesus. Here's the roadmap of what we're going to do looking at this covenant. First, we're going to look at the promises of this covenant. Second, we'll look together at the demands of the covenant. And finally, we'll look at the perfection of the covenant. The promises, the demands, and the perfection of the covenant. First, let me set the scene for you a little bit. Look at Genesis 17, verses 1 through 3. It's been 13 years since last week, 13 years since Abram and Sarai took things into their own hands and had a child named Ishmael by Hagar, Abram and Sarai's Egyptian servant. You can see at the end of chapter 16, so chapter 16, verse 16, we read that Abram was 86 years old when Hagar bore Ishmael. And now the next verse, our chapter this morning, 17, verse 1, as God comes to Abram once again, he's 99 years old. So chapter 16, verse 16, he's 86. Now one verse later, we've skipped 13 years. By the way, I just want to point out, we read all these episodes, you know, I've been tracing Abraham, the sort of adventures of Abraham for several, Abram, sorry, he's not Abraham yet, getting ahead of myself. But we've been tracing these adventures of Abram for several weeks now. And we read them, we often maybe think about them like they're just these rapid fire, back to back to back, instantaneous events in this one remarkable man's life. But if you pay attention to the time stamps that the author of Genesis has given you, like the ones I just showed you at the end of 16 and the beginning of 17, there are often significant gaps between one story and the next. And lots of silence in those gaps. In fact, God has only dialogued with Abram a handful of times over the course of his long, now 99 year old life. And I point that out because not only is that true, but that's actually often how God works in the life of the Christian, isn't it? We do as Christians following the Lord, we do experience times of rapid growth where the presence of God seems very near to us, where we open up our Bibles and it seems like everything we read just jumps off the page, where we come to worship the Lord together with God's people. We sit under preaching and it seems like the preacher is just preaching directly to us. We do have seasons like that, but then we also have long seasons of the mundane, don't we? And the unspectacular where God seems distant, where God maybe even seems silent. God shouts to us sometimes from the mountaintops, but we spend most of our days in the quiet of the valleys. And it was the same for Abram. I just want you to see, he's now 99, 13 years have passed, nothing's happened as far as the Bible is concerned. Sarah is now 89 and together in their old age, they're now parenting a teenager. God helped them. When at long last, God comes to him again and speaks with Abram once again about this covenant, which has altered the course of Abram's life. When Abram was 99 years old, we read in verse 1, The Lord appeared to Abram. Once again, he's back. And the Lord said to him, I am God Almighty. Walk before me and be blameless that I may make my covenant between me and you and may multiply you greatly. And then we read that Abram fell on his face. Now, this is really important. This, all of chapter 17, this is not, you just heard this covenant, right? God speaks of this covenant. I'm going to make my covenant with you. This is not a new covenant. This is not a different covenant from the one we've been reading about, though. The phrase there, make my covenant. You remember in chapter 15, when God, we talked about cut the covenant and then he cut animals and walked between them to promise this covenant by himself. The word here, make the covenant, is not that same word as cut. This is a different word used of a already existing covenant. So what's happening here? The covenant's already been cut in chapter 15. This, in chapter 17, is the final sealing of the same covenant that God has been forging with Abram, actually for decades now. It began all the way back in Genesis chapter 12, when God first made these big promises, people, place, blessing. The covenant was cut in chapter 15. Remember the fire and the smoke? God himself passing through the slain animals, guaranteeing in himself, swearing by himself, Hebrews says, that he would see to it, God would see to it, these promises came true. Here in chapter 17, the covenant is being finalized or sealed. We might even say that it's being signed by Abram. And it's being signed by Abram in blood, the blood of circumcision. So let's look at this covenant more carefully. Promises demands perfection. Let's begin by looking at the promises of this covenant. Remember, God has been making these promises to Abram for years now, for decades. But we've talked about this before. He keeps refining them. He keeps expanding them, making them bigger and zooming further in on the glorious details of them, showing Abram more and more and us with Abram. Well, here is the covenant is finalized. He does the same thing one last time. People, place, blessing. But now watch how he's going to refine and zoom in and expand, blow up still further these promises one last time. There are three expansions I want to show you now. Nations, kings and everlasting. Three final expansions to this covenant as it's being sealed here. Nations, kings and everlasting. Nations. Look at verse 4. Behold, my covenant is with you, God says, and you shall be the father of a multitude of nations. Verse 5, for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations. Verse 6, I will make you exceedingly fruitful and I will make you into nations. Not a nation, nations. Verse 16, look down at verse 16. To Sarah now, God says, I will bless her and moreover, I will give you a son by her. I will bless her and she shall become nations. So first expansion, nations. Not just a nation from Abram will come. Nations, a multitude of nations, peoples. Secondly, kings. Look at verse 6. I will make you exceedingly fruitful and I will make you into nations and kings shall come from you. That's a new development. We haven't heard anything over these last several chapters and all these promises being made by God to Abram about kings. Kings shall come from you, God promises. Verse 16, again to Sarah. He says, I will bless her and she shall become nations and kings of peoples shall come from her. So not just a nation, but nations are coming and not just a son, not just an heir to Abram and Sarai. Kings and kingdoms shall come from his line. And one more expansion here, nations, kings and everlasting. Did you notice as Scott was reading the passages, you were reading it this week, this morning. Did you notice the repetition of the word everlasting in these 27 verses? Let me show you verse 7. And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant to be God to you and to your offspring after you. Verse 8, and I will give to you and your offspring after you the land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession and I will be their God. Verse 13, look down at verse 13. So shall my covenant be in your flesh an everlasting covenant. Verse 19, one more time. God said, no, but Sarah, your wife shall bear you a son, not Hagar, not Ishmael. Sarah, your wife shall bear you a son and you shall call his name Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his offspring after him. Not just a nation, nations, Abraham. Not just an heir, kings, kingdoms, Abraham. And not just for you, maybe not even just for your children or your grandchildren, but forever, Abraham. Do you see how God is taking these precious promises, people, place, blessing and expanding them, making them bigger and bigger one last time as he's sealing it. Now you've read this passage. You've at least heard it read this morning. Let me ask you a question. What would you say is the heart of this covenant? As in what's the main promise? Lots of promises here, lots of expansions to promises here. But what's the promise behind all the other promises? The central thing being promised here to Abraham and to all of his descendants. What's the heart of this covenant? Look at verse 7 and let me read 7 and 8 for you one more time. And I'm going to show you what I think is the main thing, the main thrust, the heart being promised here in this Abrahamic covenant. God says, and I will establish my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant. To be God to you and to your offspring after you. And I will give to you and to your offspring after you the land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan. For an everlasting possession and I will be their God. Listen, lots of things are being promised here and all those things matter. The land matters, the descendants, the offsprings matter, the crown matters now. But the central heart and thrust of this entire covenant is God is promising to Abraham to give to him and to all his descendants himself. God is promising of all the nations who have been, all of them estranged from God, divorced from God by sin, by their own rebellion. God is promising to marry himself, to join himself back to a people, to Abram's people and to be to them their God, their husband, if you will, their friend, to walk with him. That's the point of this entire operation. It's massive that you see this. That's the heart of this covenant. God is creating a new people for his own possession to reclaim the entire world, a world lost in sin and darkness and to reclaim them to himself. That's what the covenant is all about. That's what the entire Bible is all about. God claiming a people, reclaiming a people to himself who bear his name, who belong to his kingdom, who take him, who bow before him as their king. And for a new people wedded to God, God gives new names. Did you notice that there were four new names revealed in Genesis 17 as we read about this covenant? Did you catch all four of the new names? First, God introduces himself by a new name here. In verse one, we read, I am God Almighty. Walk before me and be blameless. The words there, the phrase God Almighty. It's the first time we've read this in the Bible, and it's the title is El Shaddai. You might remember the old song, El Shaddai. I'm not going to sing it this week, but El Shaddai, first time God has called himself many things and then revealed to us as many different names already in the relatively short to this point story of the Bible. We first meet him in Genesis 1 and 2 as Elohim, which is more of a title, the name. It just means the God, the creator God. He then reveals his personal name, his covenant name, also in Genesis 2 and 3 and throughout his dealings with his people, Yahweh. Some of you have maybe names or nicknames that only your family or only your friends call, the people who really know you, you know, call you that special name, that pet name. I don't want to be offensive to the grandiosity of God, but Yahweh is sort of like that. It's the name that only the people who know God and are in relationship with God know him by. That's who calls him Yahweh. Last week, Hagar, the Egyptian servant, names God El Roy, the God of seeing. We've seen God. We already know God by many names in the Bible. But here for the first time, we're introduced to God. God introduces himself to Abram as El Shaddai, God Almighty or the Great King. Whenever we read in the Bible of El Shaddai, it's often in impossible circumstances. So the sense is he's introducing himself as the Almighty God, the God of the impossible, a very fitting name coming to Abram and Sarai, 99 and 89 years old, given what he's about to promise them, isn't it? So first, El Shaddai. Second, at long last, and I do mean at long last, because do you have any idea how difficult it is as a preacher, knowing where this story goes, to try every single week to do your best not to accidentally call him Abraham? Because Abraham does not exist yet. It's Abram. It's Abram. It's Abram. Until finally, here at long last, Abram is renamed Abraham. Verse five, no longer shall your name be called Abram, God says, but your name shall be Abraham. For I have made you the father of a multitude of nations. Abram means exalted father. That's what his original name means. We don't know what that's referring to. It could refer to God himself. Or I think it more likely refers to Abram's father, Terah, or his grandfather being somebody, being somebody that matters. An exalted father. We don't know what the meaning is because the Bible doesn't tell us other than, we don't know what it's referring to, but it does mean exalted father. Abraham means father of many. Or father of a multitude. Now let's just stop and appreciate this new name. Abram is 99 years old now. He's been waiting on this promise in some form for like 25 years. He's still seen nothing. And now God literally names him after this promise, which is still unfulfilled. Do you catch that? The name is the promise. Father of a multitude. For the rest of his life, every time anybody calls his name, every time Sarah reminds him, hey, if you wake up last, you got to be the one that makes the bed. From now on, no matter what is being said to him or who's saying it, he's going to hear afresh. The promises of God for his future and even for after he's gone. Abram is now Abraham. Third, Sarai is renamed Sarah. Verse 15. And God said to Abraham, as for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name. Sarah means princess. Princess. Now what's going on here? Is God just being doting on Sarah like a husband to his wife or like a father to his daughters? Maybe, but not exactly. What are princesses? Princesses become queens. And when they have sons and daughters and when their sons grow up and their daughters grow up, they become what? They become kings and queens, royalty. Which is exactly what verse 16 says after she's named. I will bless her, God says. I will bless princess. And moreover, I will give you a son, Abram, by her. I will bless her and she shall become nations and she shall become kings of peoples. Kings of people shall come from her. Sarai is now Sarah, which means she's a princess, which is also signaling this promise that kings and kingdoms are going to come from her. And fourth and finally, their son yet to be born is named by God as Isaac. Look at verse 17. Then Abraham, hearing all this, fell on his face and laughed and said to himself, Shall a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? Shall Sarah, who is 90 years old, bear a child? And Abraham said to God, Oh, the Ishmael might live before you. You can see here 13 years later, Abraham, we're not told exactly, but he's clearly just worked out in his own mind. Well, I guess God's going to keep these promises through Ishmael, through Hagar and my unlawful, outside of God's promises, child. God must be going to keep these things through him. But God says, No, but Sarah, your wife, shall bear you a son and you shall call his name Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his offspring after him. Abram's response here is bizarre and it's confusing. It's hard to say exactly what it is. Laughter in Genesis is often a sign of unbelief. And so we'll see just a few chapters from now. And then later in the story of the Bible, when characters laugh at God, they're often rebuked for it. But Abram's, Abraham, now I got to switch gears to Abraham. That should be the easy part. Abraham's not rebuked here for unbelief or for his laughter. And also he falls down here twice in this passage. We read that he falls down. What's falling down? It's a sign of submission. It's bowing. So he's at one in the same time, bowing down and laughing. He's rolling on the floor laughing, right? As we might say. And I think that's kind of the point here. Abraham's response is as confused as what he feels. He's 99 now, God. He doesn't know where to laugh or cry or worship or scream. And so he kind of does a little bit of everything. And Isaac, ironically or unironically, I guess, means laughter. God names him laughter because his name will be a forever reminder to Abraham and to Sarah of their surprise, of their shock, of their laughter before the promises of God. Before El Shaddai, the God of the impossible. Four new names in one chapter as this covenant is sealed. New names in the Bible typically signal a new work of God, a new beginning of God. That's what Genesis means. It means beginnings. And here in Genesis 17, four new names signal another new beginning with the work of God. Think of Eve in chapter 3. She has no name. She's the woman. And God rebegins with humanity east of Eden. And he names her Eve. Why? Because she shall be the mother of all the living. Life is cursed, fallen, separated from God, but life will continue through her. Think of even in the New Testament. Simon, renamed as Peter. Why? Jesus called him Peter. Why? Because he said Peter means rock. He says, you are Peter. You are rock. And upon you, I will build my church and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it. When God is performing, beginning a new work, he often renames his people. Here we have four new names. Why? Because this is the dawn of a new era. God is at work in Abraham and in Abraham's people. He's going to rescue the world through him. New promises for a new people. Nations and kings. People. All of Canaan, all the land of Canaan forever. Place. And God will be with them as their God. Blessing. Yes. People. Place. Blessing. Now, let's look at the demands of the covenant. Wonderful promises. Already cut. Already assured by God. Smoke and fire. But here we find out that there are demands of this covenant. Covenants in the Bible normally come with signs. We've already seen a sign given with a covenant in the Bible. Kids in the room. Can any of you remember a sign with a covenant we've already seen in the story of Genesis? I will wait. I know a kid in here's got it. Holland. Imaline. That's one of my best friends' daughters. I'm so sorry. A sign. Adelaide, help her out. Smoke and fire. Yes. Give us another sign. Adults, you might have to help out. Our kids are raising their hands. They're too obedient. What's a sign we've already seen in the Bible associated with a covenant? A rainbow. Covenants in the Bible normally come with signs. So the covenant God made with Noah never to destroy the earth again by water came with a sign in the rainbow. The covenant God's going to later make with Moses in Exodus. The Mosaic covenant also comes with a sign in the Sabbath or the Sabbath day, the Sabbath rest. And so this covenant with Abraham is now given a sign. And the sign here is what? It's circumcision. Look at verse nine. And God said to Abraham, as for you, you shall keep my covenant. You and your offspring after you throughout their generations. Notice how the speech has changed with the promises. It's all, and I will. God is saying, and I will, and I will. And now as we turn to the demands, the speech all changes from you shall, you shall, you must. This is my covenant, verse 10 says, which you shall keep between me and you and your offspring after you. Here it is. Every male among you shall be circumcised. Now, let me just say here really briefly, and then I've got to move on. This is not a covenant made only with males. It's made with all of Abraham, with Sarah too, and all of her descendants. But the males here are the representatives. The females too belong to this covenant. The females of Israel, their fathers, their brothers are representative of them. So every male among you shall be circumcised. Verse 11 says, you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskins, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and you. He who is eight days old among you shall be circumcised. Every male throughout your generations, whether born in your house or bought with your money from any foreigner who is not of your offspring, both he who was born in your house and he was bought with your money, all of them shall surely be circumcised. So shall my covenant be in your flesh an everlasting covenant. Now, you're going to hear me talk about circumcision this morning more than any other Sunday, past, present, hopefully future. And I apologize in advance, and I have no jokes or humor. So don't you worry. But we've got to deal with it. We've got to deal with circumcision because as you can see, as you can hear, it's everywhere in this passage. I want to ask the obvious question. The big question. Why circumcision? Maybe you've read this, heard this covenant before. You knew about this. You've read the New Testament and all the arguments back and forth. Jews and Gentiles to circumcise, not to circumcise. Does it matter? Doesn't it matter? What's up with circumcision? Why circumcision? You know, there are just so many other things. God, do you ever stop to think God could have done anything? A piercing of the ear, a tattoo of a cross on the small of our back. Pious and cute. Why circumcision? Circumcision is painful. This is 2000 BC Canaan. There are no anesthetics. Circumcision is bloody. And circumcision is a painful, bloody, cutting off of the most sacred and of the most intimate. And that is precisely the point. Such is the nature of sin and such is the penalty for sin. Sin is painful. Sin requires, we've already seen this in the story of Genesis repeatedly, sin requires blood and death. And sin cuts us off from God, our maker. It puts us under his curse. Sin is a sacred, intimate tragedy. It leaves us crying and hiding and ashamed. Shame comes into the world on account of sin. And all alone, it's intimate. It's not an accident that the Bible tells stories of sin, especially in Genesis, through nakedness. Think of Adam and Eve after they sin. Think of Noah and his fall. The sacrificial system is still to come, but it's coming. We already saw a taste of it in Genesis 15, blood and death and the cutting of animals. But before we even get to the sacrificial system, Abraham and all of Israel bear the same message in their own bodies. And they must bear it. Because if they don't, if they're uncircumcised, they face God's curse. Cut off. Notice the curse threatened for disobedience to this covenant. Look at verse 14. Any uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin shall be cut off from his people. He has broken my covenant. Cut off here means to be banished. It means to be divorced from God. It means to be exiled. It means you, my people, are not my people any longer. God is creating a new people under his blessing, circumcised and you're in, uncircumcised and you're out. It doesn't matter if you're Abraham's first cousin. It doesn't matter if you're Abraham's firstborn grandson. You're out. Cut off. The sign of the covenant bears the curse of the covenant. Cut off or you will be cut off. See? And you will be under God's curse. Here at last is the final full word on this covenant God has been making for 25 years with Abraham. We have promises. We have new names. We have signs. We have curses threatened. Abraham now has it all. And in verse 22, God finishes talking and verse 22 says he went up. God's done. He leaves Abraham. And let's pick up in verse 23. Then Abraham took Ishmael. What's Abraham going to do with this word of the Lord? Then Abraham took Ishmael, his son, and all those born in his house or bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house. And he circumcised the flesh of their foreskins that very day as God had said to him. Abraham was 99 years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. And Ishmael, his son, was 13 years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. That very day Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised. And all the men of his house, all those born in the house, and those bought with money from a foreigner were circumcised with him. Twice the author says, I wonder if you notice, twice the author tells us that Abraham obeyed God, circumcising every male member of his entire household. And how did he do it? When did he do it? That very day. That very day. Abraham believes. Genesis 15, 6, he believes God. And so it was reckoned to him, counted to him as righteousness. Abraham believes and so he obeys. That's the story of Abraham again and again and again. It's been an up and down journey and we've got more pits and more falls to go. But the man believes and so his posture is to obey and to obey without delay. He screws up. He gets sidetracked. He does sometimes disobey, but he always course corrects. And when God speaks, he obeys because that's what faith does. If you have faith, if you really do believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, you will obey God. Not perfectly, not always, but the posture of your life will be to obey God. You'll want to obey God. That's what faith does. That's how it changes and redirects our hearts. Do you believe? Do you want to obey God? Do you obey God? Good for Abraham. Good for Israel. But what about you? I could be done. That is the end of this passage and I know some of you would love that. But what about us? What in the world do we do with a passage like this and with circumcision? There's a sense in which this passage and a sermon on this passage has three audiences. This is weird, but think about this for a second. It's actually not that weird at all. The first audience is Abraham and Sarah and all the members of his household and Ishmael. And what's the point? What's the message? What's the application of this sermon for them? Be circumcised. That's the message. Be circumcised to seal this covenant with God. That's the first audience. The second audience is the original readers, the original audience of Genesis. Most scholars agree that Genesis was most likely written, first written for the Israelites wandering through the wilderness with Moses. And actually Joshua 5 tells us that those generations rebelled against the Lord and were not circumcised. And so what would the point of this passage and of this sermon be to that second audience? Same as Abraham. Be circumcised. Repent. Come back to God and be circumcised once again. Indeed, Joshua 5 verse 7 says that Joshua saw to it that the entire nation was circumcised. The entire nation. You were impressed by Abraham circumcising his entire household. Joshua saw to it that all of the people of Israel were circumcised in one day. But the third audience is you and me and the church today who receive this as God's revelation, scripture for us. And what's the point for us? Besides just it's history. It happened. Know that it happened. Good. Go home. What's the sermon for us? What's the point for us? Remember, master key. Master key. Circumcision. Master key. Let me show you because we're going to use this master key to burst right through and into the door of it all. Here's your sermon. I'm going to give it to you and then I'll sort of tease it out. Here's your sermon. Here's my sermon from Genesis 17. Hear me carefully. If your heart is circumcised, all of these promises for Abraham, for Israel, all of these promises and more are yours. Let me say that again. This is everything. If your heart is circumcised, then all of these promises given to Abraham and given to his descendants, Israel, all these promises and more are yours in Jesus. So let's look finally at the perfection of this covenant. Here's where I'm going to preach Genesis 17 to you, to us. Kids, let me ask you another question. How many of you, raise your hands actually, if you can remember, did you eat baby food growing up? Like actual baby food, raise your hand. Some of y'all lying. Come on, kids. Who ate baby food? Now keep your hands raised. How many of you still eat baby food? Now some of y'all still lying. You don't still eat baby food. Why not? Because it's gross, right? It's so gross. I've actually tried it feeding my own kids. Curiosity has gotten the best of me a few times. You open some of those, you pop some of those bottles and the ones, some of them are nasty, the green beans and all that sort of stuff. But pear, apple, banana, that sounds delicious. It looks delicious. It smells delicious. And so a couple of times, curiosity has gotten the best of me and it's terrible. It tastes nothing like it smells or like it sounds. And so we all stop eventually eating baby food or we should, right? The kids, some of you, my littlest is still on it, but not for long. But here's the deal. Watch this, kids and adults. That baby food that you were eating and that you did eat or that some of your kids are still eating now, that baby food was real. It really did nourish you and feed you and help you to grow and satisfy your hunger. It's real. It's not fake. But it's training you. What's it training you for? Steak, linguine, pasta Alfredo, shrimp, pizza. There it is, pizza. It's real food, but it's preparation for something better to come. Now listen to me carefully, all of you. All of these promises to Abraham and to Israel were real. They're not fake. They're not just signals or icons or something like that. They're real and they really did come true. God kept all of them. Let me show you. People, God gave Abraham and Sarah their son Isaac. Spoiling the story, but you know Isaac's coming and guess what? God turned Isaac into a nation. And even furthermore, kings came from Isaac. Kings came from Abraham and Sarah's line. What kings came from Israel? You can name so many. We have books named after the kings, first and second kings. Saul, David, Solomon, all from Abraham, all from Sarah, all from Isaac. Kings and kingdoms came. People, God really did fulfill that promise. Place, what about place? God gave Israel the promised land. They did eventually get there and it was a really nice home. I've been there. People think of Israel, at least I did, you think dry, arid desert. The Bible calls it the land flowing with milk and honey. I got there. I thought this looks like Greece or what I thought Greece looks. I've been to Greece too. It does look like Greece. It's a Mediterranean oasis. God really gave the promised land to these people. Place, people, place, and blessing. Israel had the tabernacle and then later Israel had the temple. And what was in the temple? Who was in the temple? God. God met with them there. Israel's sins were covered in the temple and the presence of God was in their midst. People, place, blessing. Every promise for Israel came true. God kept them all. They were real, but they weren't perfect. The people divided against each other and there was civil war and there were divided kingdoms. The kings rebelled, even the best of kings like David. Adultery, murder, and then he died. The land was conquered. Israel got the land and then it was conquered and they lost it and they didn't lose it once. They lost it twice. They were exiled. To this very day, the nation of Israel lives in a land that they share with their enemies. Their most valued property is not theirs. Islam owns it. Islam, the Muslims own it. And the temple was destroyed. God's people were cut off from the presence of God. Why? Because they couldn't keep the covenant. People, place, blessing. They were real, but they weren't perfect or final. The promises came true, but that included, unfortunately for Israel, that included the curses promised. For when Israel failed to keep the covenant, they were real, but they were also signs. They were training Israel, just like children on baby food, and pointing them and the world to greater things to come because God really is this good. And because all the history of the world and all the history of the Bible really is like one meticulously planned and unfolding mystery with a real life happily ever after ending. Too good to be true, but true. And so let me now use circumcision, this master key of circumcision, and Genesis 17 to unlock three doors for you, and we're done. First door, faith. Circumcision was a sign. It was real, but it was a sign, pointing and training for something else. Before we even leave the Old Testament, before we even leave Moses' book, the Bible is telling you what that sign of circumcision was pointing to and training for. Listen to Deuteronomy 30, verse 6. Please listen to these words of God carefully. And the Lord your God, Moses writes, will circumcise your heart and the heart of your offspring so that you will love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and that you might live. Jeremiah chapter 4, verse 4. Listen to Jeremiah prophesying. Circumcise yourselves to the Lord. Now listen to this. It's bizarre, but catch the imagery. Remove the foreskin of your hearts, O men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem. Do you see? Do you see what the sign is pointing to and training towards? What's it pointing to? Circumcision of the flesh. What's it pointing to and training for? Circumcision of the heart. Jeremiah 31, 33. Indeed, this is what God was promising in the new and final covenant. The Holy Spirit would come and do just that. Jeremiah 31, 33. For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the Lord. I will put my law within them and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God and they shall be my people. Circumcision was an act of total devotion demanded by God for his people. But it did not fix their hearts. Their hearts were still broken. Their hearts were still wicked. They were still wicked on the inside. And so they still disobeyed. But God is going to do something about that, the prophet's promise. He's going to take the surgical blade of heaven and by his own spirit cut into our hearts and change us from the inside out. Replace those stony hearts with hearts of flesh. Why? So that we could really love God and really obey God. Listen, this is what Paul reads, Philippians 3, 3. For we are the circumcision. We are the circumcision. Who is he talking about? Paul's a Jew. He's talking about Jews? No. Who are the circumcision? We who worship by the spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh. We are the circumcision. You need a new heart. A circumcised heart. And how do you get that? By faith. It's what the entire Bible is teaching. Believe and God will give you a new heart. Believe and God will. Right now you believe and God will circumcise your heart. He'll give you a new heart that you might obey. And what do you believe in? Not what, but who? Second door, Jesus. Master key, Jesus. Jesus was born. God's king was born. Also from the line of Abraham and Sarah. And he was born under the law. On the eighth day, Luke 221 says, Jesus was circumcised. And then, interestingly, it says that he was given the name Jesus, which means God saves. New beginning, new work, new name, circumcision, eighth day. Now why was he circumcised? He was circumcised because he was an Israelite. And he was the Israelite, the faithful Israelite, the covenant keeper that we've all been waiting for. He kept God's covenant. He kept God's laws. And he kept every last one of them because somebody had to. For the rest of us, somebody had to obey. And for his entire life and every single one of his God's laws, he only ever obeyed. He obeyed and then at the end of his life, he came under God's curse. He himself was cut off by God. Colossians 2 says, listen to this. Colossians 2 says that we have been circumcised, we who believe, by the circumcision of Christ. What a weird phrase. What is that referring to? The circumcision of Christ? It's not referring to his circumcision on the eighth day. What a strange phrase. But Paul's almost certainly referring to, most interpreters agree, he's almost certainly referring to the death of Jesus. The cutting off of Christ. The cross of Christ. The circumcision of Christ. Jesus, God's king and Abraham's true heir, was cut off from God, forsaken by God for you and for me and for our sins. Cutting, circumcision, animals, sacrifice, all real, but signs, pointing, training for the real thing. Jesus Christ, the lamb of God, cut off for our sins. Believe in the Lord Jesus that God might circumcise your heart. Believe in the Lord Jesus that you might be forgiven for your sins. Third door. Every promise perfected. Every promise perfected. People, place, blessing. Let's say it together one last time because this is it. People, that was my fault, that was my cue. People, place, blessing. Let's say it all together one time. People, place, blessing. Israel tasted them all, I just showed you. Israel lost them all. That's not the end of the story because those promises, real, but real signs, pointing, training for something better, for the church, for us, for all who believe. People, Abraham is the father, watch this, not just of Israel, but of all who believe, who have been spiritually circumcised. So where does the story of the Bible end? After this, I looked and behold, a great multitude that no one could number from every nation, from every tribe and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the lamb of God, clothed in white robes with palm branches in their hands and crying out with a loud voice, salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne and to the land, to the lamb. Sand was never enough, the stars were never enough, Isaac was never enough, the nations, that is all from every nation who worshiped Jesus, the children of Abraham, what Paul calls the Israel of God, around the throne in heaven, safe in the lamb, worshiping the lamb, I'm gonna join that chorus someday, you're gonna join that chorus someday if you're in Christ. Now it's just the dress rehearsal as we sung earlier with this poor lisping, stammering tongue, but we're rehearsing for the ultimate chorus where with a new voice, we'll sing to the lamb forever, joining the nations, place, Canaan is a real place, but you got it, it's a sign, training and pointing to something else, pointing to the inheritance of all who believe, what's the inheritance? Where does the Bible end? Revelation 21, then I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away and the sea was no more and I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, the new Canaan coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. Listen, heaven, sorry to disappoint you, will not be clouds and a floating disembodied existence and experience. I don't know if you think that'd be awesome or terrible, but that's not what heaven will finally be like. Jesus is renewing and perfecting the entire world, marrying earth as we know it to heaven, redeeming it all and then giving it all to his saints. We're gonna rule over it like Adam was meant to rule over the garden as we run through it to the glory of God, place and blessing. God saved us in Jesus and he gives us everything and when I say he gives us everything, I mean he gives us everything. You see, in that land, he will be with them, he will be their reward. Revelation 21, and I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, behold, the dwelling place of God is with man, he will dwell with them and they will be his people and God himself will be with them as their God. Then and there, he will wipe away every tear from their eyes and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning nor crying nor pain anymore for the former things have passed away. Blessing, people, place, blessing, and who inherits those blessings? Everyone with a circumcised heart, everyone who trusts in Jesus and follows him as king. Physical circumcision is nothing, spiritual circumcision is everything, it's how these promises become yours. It's your access to heaven and to all the blessings of God. It's your access to people, to place, to blessing forever. God has kept these promises and he's kept each and every one of them perfectly forever. Amen. God, thank you for your word. Thank you for all the promises ours in Christ. We pray that you would help us by faith to take them, to wait upon them, in Jesus' name and for your glory, we pray, amen.
