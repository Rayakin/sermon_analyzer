It's so good to be with you this morning. I'm thankful that Kira and I could venture up this way. And I'm especially thankful to see what the Lord's doing here. Praise be to the Lord. Four-year-old church, gathered together, worshiping the Lord. We have had the joy of traveling in a number of places in my role with the Pillar Network. And it is so good to see a good mixture of some folks around my age, some folks around my kids' age, some folks around my grandkids' age. So it's good to see that kind of mixture. That means the Lord's doing something, that you're learning to love each other and care for each other. So I can tell you from our perspective, it is a great encouragement to see that, especially in a young church. And I appreciate Pastor Matt and his praying for churches needing revitalization. We have been engaged in some of that personally, and we've been trying to help others along the way in that. And it is a challenging work. So continue to pray for the work of revitalization to take place. Well, open your Bibles, 1 Peter chapter 2. We're going to look at verses 4 and 5. Ashley read those verses for us a moment ago. And we'll also keep in mind those first three verses. I'll allude to them in a few moments. But back when we moved to the home where we live now back in the early 2000s, we had this lovely dogwood tree along the side of our yard where there were flowers and plants. And it was right in the middle. And during this time of year, always these beautiful pink blooms until last year. And I noticed something a little fishy a couple years before. I thought, eh, some of these limbs don't look too good. But last year, no blooms, no green twigs, nothing. And that tree had always caught my eye. And finally, I realized there's no life here. There's no signs of life in this tree. And if there is no growth for a sustained period of time, then that means there is no life. Well, in a similar way, there's sure a sign that one has life in Christ will be evidences of spiritual growth. Now, you may think, well, somebody can fake that. Yeah, you can tape dogwood blooms on a dogwood tree. You can tape some leaves on there. But before long, you're going to realize these things are fake. Because dead stems don't produce leaves and flowers. Neither can a person in whom the Holy Spirit is not dwelling reproduce the character of Christ or a humble, holy life filled with hope and joy even in adversity. And we can quickly get under condemnation when we start talking about spiritual growth. We have all kinds of ideas on that. Maybe some of you think spiritual growth means you're a rocket blast. You're always going up like that. I hope you'll get over that pretty quickly. Because that's not the way spiritual growth happens. Growth in Christ comes in seasons. Sometimes you have some quick growth, a few spurts here and there. And then that quick growth seems to take time to solidify. It may be slow. Growth may sometimes be unnoticed. You may not see it as much as someone else sees it in you. But that growth continues as evidence of life lingers. I remember as a young Christian, I struggled with whether I was growing fast enough. I just didn't feel like I was growing that much. Because I kept comparing myself and the things that I said and how I acted with really mature Christians who had been growing in the Lord for many, many years. And then I read a little illustration that helped me. There was a seminary president that received a student in his office. And the student said, she was just kind of tired of being in seminary. Wanted to know, is there not a quicker way to finish? I mean, I'm tired of this. I'm going to go on. And the president said, sure. There's a quicker way. But you've got to decide something. When God wants to grow a squash, He takes three months. When He wants to grow an oak, He takes 100 years. You've got to decide, do you want to be a squash or do you want to be an oak? And I realized that I was trying to be satisfied with squash kind of growth. And what I mean by that, sometimes we settle for flash in the pan spiritual growth. That's squash type growth. You grow for a couple of months, then you're dead. No life. And Jesus warned about that in Matthew 13. About those who receive the word with joy, then the sun comes up. Then the trials come. Then the difficulties come. And they totally wither. Because there was really no life. I mean, the kind of blaze that happens when a chef is cooking a flambe. I don't know if you bake it or put it on the top, whatever it is. I know it's just flashing up and all these flames are coming up. But then it dies down. That's the quick growth mentality. Instead, we need to think about oak tree kind of spiritual growth. The kind that is steady. It's really spiritual. It is regular. No flash. It's solid. It's immovable. It's the kind of growth in which you magnify the Lord God. Not only as creator, you do that. But you magnify him as redeemer. That's true spiritual growth. And it shows up in your conversations. It shows up in your decisions. It shows up in your attitudes. It shows up in your relationships. It shows up in your worship. It shows up in your hunger for the word. It shows up in your witness. It shows up in your prayer life. It shows up in your hope. It shows up in your joy. If you think about Peter, he knew something about the struggles of growth. No one would doubt that Peter was self-assured. He thought he had everything together. You read his story. That's the way the New Testament helps us to see people in reality. And the Old Testament does that as well. But Peter had this trouble of always putting his foot in his mouth. And he was regularly doing that. He would boast about things. He boasted he would never deny the Lord Jesus. Even if it meant death, then he denied the Lord Jesus. I mean, he miserably failed. But the Lord restored him. Great mercy and grace from the Lord. But even after his recovery, Peter slipped into legalism and a man-fearing spirit. You may remember the story in Galatians 2. Paul inserts that there was this problem of legalism that was sweeping through the believers. And even Peter himself got caught up in this. So much so that Paul rebuked this great spiritual leader of the church. I mean, just when Peter thought that he had spiritual growth in hand, he struggled again. And rightly so. Because later on in Philippians 3, Paul reminds us, we have not arrived. He said, I haven't arrived. I'm still on that trajectory in my spiritual life where I'm pressing on to the mark of the prize of the high call of God in Christ Jesus. He wanted Christ to be completely evident in his life. Now, that doesn't happen until we see the Lord face to face. But we're to be on that path. But how do we get there? Alright, that's a fair question, isn't it? How do we grow spiritually? How do we get to that point so that Christ's character is being reproduced in us? That the life of Christ becomes more and more evident in us. How do we get the right focus on growth? Well, let's consider these first three verses. I just want to give you a snippet of where he's going. And then we're going to zero in on the aim of spiritual growth. So what Peter does in verses 1-3 is identify three means of growth. It's really a condensed approach to spiritual growth. And I'll give it to you in three phrases. First, live in the therefores. Live in the therefores. Notice verse 1. So, or it's really the Greek word therefore. So we could translate it, so then, therefore. Well, why does he put so or so then or therefore at this point? Because he's pulling in what he's already been addressing in the first chapter. And what does he address there? You'll notice that he tells us in verse 3 that we've been born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. And because of that, we have received an inheritance which is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading. It's kept in heaven for us. We who are being kept by the power of God for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. He says, so then, because that is true, there are some actions that are to be taking place in your life. Therefore, he says, and then a little bit later on, he talks about how we were redeemed not with perishable things like silver and gold, but with the precious blood as of a lamb, unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ. You hadn't been redeemed by futile things. You had been reconciled to God by the bloody death of the Lord Jesus Christ who not only died for you, but was raised from the dead on your behalf so that you are brought into his death and resurrection. Now back in verse 1, chapter 2. So, if it is true of you that you've been born again, that you've been redeemed, if that is true of you, he says, put away all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander. Live in the therefores. And by that, learn to meditate on, learn to think on, learn to reflect on, learn to pray about, and learn to live in the redemptive, regenerating work of the Lord Jesus Christ. Find your satisfaction in Christ. If you're going to grow in the Lord, you've got to think on him. If you're going to grow in the Lord, you've got to see what the declarations or indicatives of Scripture are saying. This is now true of you in Jesus Christ. So, when you're reading your Bible, and you see something that is clearly in context, declaring this is yours in Christ, that's one of those therefores. Learn to live in those, alright? We could spend the rest of the afternoon just going through and just flipping through the Scripture and seeing those. And seeing what Christ is doing. Learn to live in the therefores. Second, put aside the deeds of the flesh. Put aside the deeds of the flesh. Or, we could use Roman 6 language, put aside the body of sin. So, he says, so then, so therefore, put away all malice and deceit and hypocrisy, envy and all sunder. Put these things aside. In other words, he's saying we've got to be serious if we're going to grow in the Lord Jesus about dying to sin. Your pastor was praying about that a moment ago. Learning how to put to death those sin habits. To be serious about battling sin by the provisions of the Lord Jesus Christ. Now, we're not monks who decide we're going to live away from everybody. And we're going to beat ourselves with whips to try to make ourselves deal with sin. No. We go to the cross. I mean, that's what Roman 6 teaches us. That's what Colossians 2 and 3 teach us. That's what Peter is teaching us at this point. Look in verse 24 in this same chapter. Where he says, he himself bore our sins in his body on the tree that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. Do you see what Peter is saying? Jesus not only died on the cross for you so that you'd be forgiven. Jesus died on the cross for you so that you would die to sin. You would take seriously what it means to live a life that looks like Jesus. A holy life. And so a big part of spiritual growth is applying the gospel to our desires. And our thoughts. And our speech. And our actions. And our relationships. What we do, we die to sin and we replace that sin with the virtues that we see in the Lord Jesus Christ. As Paul said, put on the Lord Jesus Christ and do not make provision for the flesh and its lusts. Put on Jesus. And so if there's an area of sin that you're battling with, then not only do you say, Lord Jesus, please help me to apply the cross to this. Please help me to die to this sin. But what is the opposite of whatever that sin is that you see in Christ? Then you say, Lord, let me put on you. Let me put on this particular virtue that we see in you. Again, this is one of those wonderful things to think about that helps us in our growth. Third thing. So first, you live in the therefore. Second, you put aside or put to death the deeds of the flesh. The Puritans called that mortification. So you're mortifying, you're putting to death the deeds of the flesh. Third, crave or long for the word of God. Crave, long for the word of God. Make it your ambition to know, understand, and live in the word. Notice it, he says, like newborn infants long for the pure spiritual milk. Some translations have it, the milk of the word that by it you may grow up into salvation. He says, if indeed you've tasted that the Lord is good. In other words, if you know the grace of God, the saving grace of God, then be one of those that's regularly making it your ambition to know and understand and live in the word. Now, when Peter spoke of this pure spiritual milk or the pure milk of the word, he wasn't using it in a negative way that you see in the writer of Hebrews and you see in Paul in 1 Corinthians. Rather, he was expressing it like this. Just like a baby longs for milk and can't be satisfied unless it gets that milk. He said, that's the way you need to be. I want to ask you something. Is that you? You have to have the word every day. Is your heart crying out? Is your passion, Lord, I've got to know you. I've got to hear from you. I've got to see you in the word. Long to understand the word the way Jesus did. The way the apostles did. That the word focuses on him. It is a Christ-centered word from Genesis to Revelation. And yet, we can have this pattern where we live in their force. We're dying to sin. We're craving the word of God. We can have that pattern, but where do we go when we're putting these into practice? Where does healthy spiritual growth take us? Healthy spiritual growth leads us to Jesus as our life and joy. And that's what we see in verses 4 and 5. If we're going to feel the wind in ourselves in spiritual growth, then we're going to see that wind has taken us to Christ. So that Christ is being formed in us. Healthy spiritual growth leads us to know and experience more of the wonder of relationship to Jesus Christ. Do you want to take that road to growth? Then let's see how that happens. We'll consider it under two headings. First, spiritual growth keeps bringing us to Jesus. In verse 3, you have this proposition. If you have tasted that the Lord is good, or if you have tasted the kindness of the Lord, if you've experienced Him, because being a Christian is experiential. I mean, you're not a nod on the log and, okay, I'm a Christian. No, you're experiencing Him. It is a relationship. And so he says, if you have tasted. I'm glad he used that word. When you taste something, you know it's there, don't you? I mean, you think about a piece of chocolate. Well, my mind would go to that. Or you think about a spoonful of honey. I mean, anything that tastes really good, you taste it and you feel it and it affects you. He said, if you've tasted the goodness of the Lord, if you've tasted His kindness, there's the proposition, then that's going to lead to an action we see in verse 4. And so you see how he is expressing this, that after this exhortation, now there is this longing within us for continuing spiritual growth. As you come to Him, the text says, you've tasted of Him. Now, as you come to Him, literally, as you keep coming to Him, as you keep coming to Him, a living stone rejected by men, but in the sight of God chosen and precious. And so the intention in spiritual growth is for our spiritual disciplines, and you know what I mean by that, spiritual disciplines of getting into the Word, praying, dying to sin, fellowship, worshiping together, gathering with one another in the Lord. All those spiritual disciplines are bringing us to Christ. Alan Stibbs writes that this whole idea expresses the idea of drawing near with the intention to stay and enjoy personal fellowship with Jesus. So that's what's happening in our spiritual discipline. This moves us from the mechanical approach to the Christian life, and by that I mean, if you're one of those that just has a spiritual checklist, okay, I've got to do this spiritual thing today, read a little bit of Bible, take a few minutes and pray, I'm going to call somebody and just say, hey, how are you doing, and that's it. Okay, all those things are good, hope you do those, but where's it taking you? Do you see Christ through these means of grace that God has given to you? As we come to the Lord's Supper a little later, do you see the Lord's Supper as a means of grace to bring you more into experience of life in Christ? You see, that's what we're to continually be doing. Yes, we can say, read a little Bible, pray a little bit, a little bit of fellowship, but where's the freshness in your life? Where's the joy in your life? If we just want to satisfy ourselves that we've done our duty spiritually and so we can peaceably go on doing other things, then we're missing what Peter is saying here. He really blows the whole idea up. That in spiritual growth, first he says, we keep coming to Jesus because we are needy. We keep coming to Jesus because we are needy. I mean, the more we grow, the more we feel our neediness before the Lord. I came to faith in Christ in 1969. That was definitely before most of you folks were born. Some of you were around during those days. And I can tell you this. I want Him more. I feel my neediness more and more. And that's a good thing because feeling your neediness of the Lord is a sign of growth. And as we grow in Christ, we see Him in His divine perfections when we see ourselves as sinners deserving judgment. But instead, we've received mercy from Christ. And so we feel our weakness and how that apart from Jesus' strength and enabling, we can't walk in obedience. We can't serve. We can't worship. We can't preach. We can't do those things. That's why we keep coming to Him because it's only in Christ that our soul needs will be met. It's only in relationship to Him that we experience His life and joy and hope in the journey and the challenges that go through life. I mean, do you ponder your neediness of the Lord? Sometimes we so stuff things into our schedules that it keeps us from pausing and seeking the Lord and asking Him to show us our soul desperation. And so we need to pray with the psalmist. Psalm 139, 23, and 24. Search me, O God, and know my heart. Try me. Try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any hurtful way in me. Then lead me in the everlasting way. I mean, we can get so busy doing good activities. And I think this is one of the biggest dangers that pastors and elders, deacons, leaders in churches face. We can do wonderful things, good things. We're serving people. We're engaging people. Yet we can do all that and fail to be still and know that the Lord is God as Psalm 46 teaches us. I mean, this is where we need to read the psalms over and over. The psalmist would continually feel his need before the Lord. For instance, Psalm 69, verses 1 through 3. Save me, O God, for the waters have threatened my life. I have sunk in deep mire. Don't you picture that? You say, hmm, that's me. I have sunk in deep mire and there is no foothold. I've come into deep waters and a flood overflows me. I'm weary with my crying. My throat is parched. My eyes fail while I wait for my God. Or Psalm 38, verses 1 through 3. O Lord, rebuke me not in your wrath and chasten me not in your burning anger for your arrows have sunk deep into me. Do you see how visceral that consciousness is of the Lord? Your hand has pressed down on me. There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation. There is no health in my bones because of my sin. Brothers and sisters, unless we know how deeply we need the Lord, and I would say how deeply we need him every day, then our motivation to seek him and meet him in spiritual growth is going to falter. So neediness is welcome. So if you came to this worship service today and you just feel this depth of need, thank God for that as a gift because Christ is ready to meet that need in his very person in life and through his work. So neediness is welcome because in that neediness we go to Christ who alone can satisfy us. But secondly, not only do we keep coming to Jesus because we're needy, but we keep coming to Jesus because he is sufficient. Notice the imagery that he uses here. As you come to him, a living stone. Now, just a couple of verses later, Peter is using the prophets from the Psalms and from Isaiah to speak of Christ in a building metaphor. Behold, I'm laying in Zion. For it stands in Scripture. That is, it stands forever in Scripture. Behold, I'm laying in Zion a stone, a cornerstone chosen and precious. Whoever believes in him will not be put to shame. This cornerstone, this living stone, is a person in whom we believe. And so he uses this kind of language and then he pulls together this phrase. As you come to him, a living stone rejected by men, but in the sight of God, chosen and precious. Now, think about Israel and how they valued the temple above everything else. But the Lord said, there's something greater than the temple, something more important than the temple, that he would send his son and he would be the temple in whom we find refuge. Jesus, talking with the Jewish people, said, but I say to you, something greater than the temple is here. And when the religious people eyed the temple and they were talking about it, Jesus said, destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up. And John explained that he was speaking of the temple of his body. Later on in John's revelation in chapter 21, verse 22, it says that he saw the new Jerusalem coming down out of heaven. Then he said this, I saw no temple in it. Now think about how the Jewish people, that was central to everything. I saw no temple in it. For the Lord God, the Almighty, and the Lamb are its temple. See, there's no need anymore for an earthly temple. But rather, Jesus has fulfilled that temple. He is God who came in the flesh. We were singing about that earlier, O come, O come, Emmanuel. We're singing about that advent of him coming in the flesh, satisfying the full measure of all that they attempted to do in the temple, in the sacrificial system. Satisfying that through his bloody death at the cross so that Jesus himself became the mercy seat. And he became the sacrifice offered on the mercy seat so that God was satisfied through what Christ did on our behalf. And so he says, as you come to him a living stone, you find him living. Now, we walk out. I don't know if y'all have lots of stones around here. I remember being in one Central Asian country and I was riding with a group of brothers and there were stones everywhere. I mean, everywhere. And I remember one of my friends says, Boy, they sure know how to grow stones around here. I mean, they were everywhere. None of them were living. None. But he says, you come to Jesus, he's a living stone because he is the sin-bearing Lord Jesus Christ who was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father. Death has no more claim on him, nor does death have power over those that Jesus has united to himself in his saving power. He's taken the sting of death upon himself so that we might face death not as the end, not as a point of annihilation, not even as something to fear, but as the point of crossing over into life forever in his presence. I love that taunt in 1 Corinthians 15. O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting? The writer of Hebrews in Hebrews 2, 14 and 15 said, Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise also partook of the same, so that through death he might render powerless him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, and might free those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives. I love the way Sam Patterson, who founded Reformed Theological Seminary, put it. He said, Christ has made death his handyman. Christ has made death his handyman and has reduced death to a servant who can only open the door to heaven for Christ's people. So let me ask you, do we get saved and suddenly never ever have a fear of death again? I've been around folks a long time. I've faced something of death along the way. We still face some troubles, don't we? So what do we do? We keep coming back to Christ. We keep learning to live life in him. We keep seeing that Jesus is the living stone. He is the one that is raised from the dead. He is the one that frees us from the fear of death that begins to rise in our minds. So keep coming to him. Keep coming to him as your sin-bearing Savior. Keep coming to him as your resurrection, life-giving Lord. Keep coming to him as your ascended, reigning, heavenly mediator. And only as we, through the means of grace that he's given, only as we come to him and rely upon him, do we keep discovering the power of life in Jesus and we keep on growing spiritually. And as we come to Jesus, we find him sufficient to calm not just our fears, but to relieve our guilt, to show to our burdens, to bear our heartaches, to comfort us in afflictions, and to fill us with hope in his promises. So we keep coming to Jesus because we're needy. We keep coming to Jesus because he is sufficient. And third, we keep coming to Jesus because he is worthy. As we utilize the means of grace for spiritual growth, living in the therefores, dying to self, feeding on the word, we keep coming to Jesus, as this passage says, as to a living stone rejected by men, but in the sight of God, chosen and precious. So we've read it in the scripture of how a few days after the triumphal entry into Jerusalem, where the crowds were cheering, suddenly the crowds jeered and they mocked the Lord Jesus. They called for his death. The religious leaders, the priests, the scribes, the members of the Jewish Sanhedrin mocked him. They called him a blasphemer. They condemned him as unworthy to continue living. They rejected Jesus because Jesus did not fit the kind of Savior that they wanted. Maybe some of you have created in your own minds the kind of Savior you want. I can tell you, Jesus is not that person. I mean, they look for a political Savior and Jesus came rather to be the sin bearer, to be the redeemer for people from every tribe, tongue, people, and nation. They looked for a king who would fight the Romans, but Jesus came for a bigger reason, to destroy the works of the devil and establish an eternal kingdom. They looked for a spokesman who would rubber stamp their religious ideas. Well, that sounds like American Christians, doesn't it? But he came to be the light of life and the Word made flesh so that through him we might come to God. So, men still reject Jesus. We see it all the time. That idea of rejection, the term that's used here means to reject after examination. They look at the Jesus of the gospel. They evaluate the Jesus of the gospel and say, no, no, he's just not worthy. No, he doesn't deserve my loyalty and my affections. We encounter it all the time, don't we? I mean, we see it publicly in media. We see it in some of the anti-God movements that are so prevalent. And sometimes we get shocked by that. We get shocked by the way the world rejects Jesus. That's the norm. As a matter of fact, that's where we were. That's how we were living until God met us in his saving grace. Certainly, we pray for the Lord to blow through our nation with a spiritual awakening, but until that time comes, don't be surprised at what you see. But this Jesus, this living stone in the sight of God is chosen and precious. The CSB translates it chosen and honored by God. The New Living translation actually, at this point, has a helpful translation. He is precious to God who chose him. The emphasis is that the Father chose. The word here is elected. The Father elected Jesus, which borrows language, and I think filled the language of Peter in his sermon at Pentecost, Acts 2.23. This man, delivered over by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you nailed to the cross by the hands of godless men and put him to death. And so this preciousness of Jesus implies that he is highly valuable to God. He is God's gift beyond all expense and worthiness. And so we're meant to feel something of the contrast that men who are but dust reject Jesus. But God the Father, who made all the dust, who created the world, considers his Son, in whom he is well pleased, more valuable than all the worlds combined. And so we're told, through the means of grace given for spiritual growth, to keep coming to him who, in the sight of God, is chosen and precious, highly valuable. But what do we do so often? We complain. We murmur. We gripe. We grumble. We wallow in despair. We get into despondency. I worked with a pastor one time, and it seemed like every Monday he would come in, just dragging, and the word he used, he said, I'm in the moly grubs. I mean, I heard that so many times. Thinking, why do we need to be like that? When we have such a Savior as the Lord Jesus Christ. I mean, we can grow lazy and undisciplined in our spiritual life. And yes, when that happens, we're going to find ourselves moving in the wrong direction. But God has given us such a Savior who is chosen and precious. The Lamb who is slain. The Lamb who is worthy to receive power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing. That's what all of heaven says. And if he's like that, then healthy spiritual growth is going to lead us to see Jesus with new eyes, to taste him with fresh desire, to love him with renewed affections, to enjoy him with intense delight and joy. John Calvin reminds us in his comments on this passage that he only makes progress in the gospel who in heart comes to God. And that's what we're doing. We're coming to him. We will not come to him apart from the means that he has given to us to grow in the grace and knowledge of Christ. Squash or oak? Squash? Flash pan? It's not going to satisfy. It's going to rot. Believe me, I've grown enough squash in my life. I'm from Alabama. I grew a lot of squash. And it all rots. But not those oak trees. They keep standing. And so we must embrace the means of grace to keep coming to him. Second, spiritual growth keeps uniting us as the church in life and service. Spiritual growth keeps uniting us in life and service. You see, what Peter wants us to understand is that we are affected by one another's spiritual growth. The way I grow in the Lord is going to affect the congregation where I'm a member, Midtown Baptists in Memphis. It's going to affect the rest of the congregation. This means that while we work individually on our spiritual growth, it's really a corporate practice. We give single-minded attention to the Lord Jesus, coming to Him daily, finding Him as our life and joy. But that act of growth is going to contribute to the growth and maturity of the entire body. Notice the movement in verse 4. We come to Christ, this living stone. And then in verse 5 we see that Christ is building up His house, building up His church as a spiritual house. So, in other words, if we're not coming to Christ, if we're being spiritually lazy, if we're being undisciplined, you're not just affecting you. You're affecting this church. You're covenanted together as members to help one another grow in the grace and knowledge of Christ. But if you're not seeking to grow, then you're affecting everyone else. This means that the local congregation needs every member's contribution to its spiritual growth and health. So as we come to Christ, Christ is building up the church as a spiritual house to offer up spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God. As we come to Christ, Christ is shaping us as a people into a holy priesthood, a corporate priesthood under God. Three aspects of this truth I wanted to say. First, Jesus keeps building His church. The verb expresses in verse 5 this ongoing, lively action of Jesus in building the church together. And so, you come to Him a living stone rejected by men in the sight of God, chosen and precious. You yourselves like living stones. You see what He's doing, don't you? You have been affected by the risen Lord Jesus. You are now in union with Him as the crucified, resurrected Lord. And so now, you are living stones. You're made alive like Him. And you're being built up as a spiritual house to a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. So, who's doing the building in this metaphor? Not us. You're not building your church. Christ is. Wouldn't you rather have Him as a builder? I guarantee you, as pastors, we want Jesus building the church because we know how weak we are. We want Jesus building it. And so, the passive voice here is indicating that the one who is precious and chosen in the sight of God is doing the building. But that's what Jesus said in Matthew 16. He said, I will build my church. And because I'm building it, the gates of Hades will not prevail against it. And so, He's using this construction terminology that block by block, stone by stone, wall to rafter to room, Jesus does the building. And certainly, we could look at this and say, well, you know, He's building the universal church, the invisible church. Well, think about Peter. Do you think Peter was an invisible sort of guy? He wasn't that kind of person. Was he writing to an invisible church? He was writing to local congregations, to suffering churches to encourage Him in the middle of hardship and oppositions. And He wanted them to know, Jesus is building you. Jesus is building the church into a spiritual house to offer up spiritual sacrifices. And to be a spiritual house means you are suitable for the spirits indwelling. Paul used seminal language in Ephesians 2, 19-22 where he said the church is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets. Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone in whom the whole building, he's talking about local churches, in whom the whole building being fitted together is growing into a holy temple in the Lord in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit. The same Lord who saved us by His death and resurrection is presently building us and shaping us so that we'll be a really good dwelling place for the Holy Spirit in our corporate life together. That always blows me away. That here this group of believers, different backgrounds, different influences, but you come together under the banner of the cross and resurrection of Christ and the Lord Jesus is intentionally building you so that you will be a suitable dwelling place for the Holy Spirit so that when you come together the Spirit of God is present in this corporate gathering. I mean, the Jews labored to build the tabernacle and later they built the temple so that what? So that God might dwell in their midst. But through Christ something far greater is happening. We've got congregations scattered all over the world and the Holy Spirit is dwelling in us. All the temple was doing was foreshadowing something in microcosm fashion to what He is doing in far greater fashion. Then our spiritual growth through the means Christ has given to us becomes the process of the Holy Spirit building up of the church. And so He builds us as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood. It's no longer the tribe of Levi. It's whatever your name is. Trinity. You are a bunch of priests. Now, what did priests do? Did they just sit around all the time? No, they were active. They were involved. This priesthood is a new status that has been given to you so that you have been set apart to belong to the Lord and you have the capacity now to proclaim the excellencies of the one who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light. The second thing we see not only does Jesus keep building the church He keeps enabling the church. As a holy priesthood He says you're to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. You see, Jesus doesn't save the people and make them a spiritual house and entrust them with a holy priesthood so that we can be mannequins in a store window. The one thing that was missing in the furniture in the temple was a chair. You got all kinds of things, don't you? You don't have chairs which is picturing something for us that there is this ongoing activity and you don't even have to have seminary training. You, by the calling the saving call of Jesus through the gospel in your life now you are priests who have the capacity to offer yourselves as living sacrifices as Romans 12 tells us. You as priests have the capacity now to offer the sacrifice of your lips giving praise to His name as Hebrews 13, 15 tells us. You have the capacity now to proclaim as verse 9 in this same 1 Peter 2 says you have the capacity to proclaim the excellencies of His redemptive work that you've experienced. You have the capacity to pray without ceasing as 1 Thessalonians 5, 17 says. You have the capacity to offer the sacrifices of doing good and sharing with one another as Hebrews 13, 16 says. So, here's where our spiritual growth shapes our praise and gratitude. It gives power to our gospel witness. It deepens us in praying in the Holy Spirit. It intensifies our serving one another. It brings us daily to the altar of being living sacrifices. And so we exercise the means of grace in spiritual growth and in doing so we find Jesus to be sufficient in the joy of our hearts and He works through our devotedness to Him to shape us as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood so that we keep offering up spiritual sacrifices pleasing to God. That means there's no coasting, no lethargy, no neglect. If indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good then grow through the means that Christ has given you so that by His mercy He might keep building you up together as a temple of the Lord. The third thing we see is that Jesus keeps welcoming His church. That's what's meant by offering spiritual sacrifices to God. He's building His church, He's enabling His church and now He's welcoming His church. So, through life in Christ, through the way of His death and resurrection, through His intensified affection, this intensified affection for Him as we grow spiritually, we're offering up spiritual sacrifices of witness and praise and prayer and service and our lives with the assurance that what we offer, He accepts it. Isn't this where we struggle sometimes? Is what I'm doing good enough for Him? Is He going to accept it? He does not accept what we do because we do such a great job. I love the way Calvin puts it. There's never found in our sacrifices such purity that they are of themselves acceptable to God. We need to realize that. So, we remember we're living constantly by the grace of God. He goes on and says that there's never found also that they are themselves acceptable to God. Our self-denial is never entire and complete. Our prayers are never so sincere as they ought to be. We are never so zealous and so diligent in doing good but that our works are imperfect and mingled with many vices. Now that you are fully depressed, listen to the rest of the statement. Nevertheless, Christ procures favor for them. They, that is all of our service, our praise, our worship, they are accepted not for the merit of their own excellency but they're accepted through Christ. I mean, here we are weak, needy, desperate, seeking to live through the... live unto Christ through the therefores, the declarations of Scripture, dying to sin, hungering for the Word and through the means of growth that He has given to us, we come to Him, we find Jesus far more wonderful, far more sufficient beyond anything that we've imagined or thought and as we glory in Him and enjoy Him, He grows us corporately and He gives us the joy of being a church full of holy priests who are offering spiritual sacrifices which God accepts not because we do so well but because we belong to Jesus who died and rose again for us and since He treasures us, the Father accepts our meager offerings of praise and thanks and preaching and witness and prayers and then what happens? We want to keep growing in the grace and knowledge of Christ knowing that until that day comes that we perfectly mirror Him, there's still more room to grow and that day will come when we see Him face to face but until that day, let's take aim in our spiritual growth brothers and sisters to come to the risen Lord Jesus Christ and see Him as all in all. Let's pray together. If your faith and trust is not in this Jesus we've been speaking of who died for sinners who rose from the dead we exhort you together this whole congregation exhorts you to repent of your sins to put your trust in Christ to cling to Him, to look to Him please take the time to speak with one of the pastor's elders in this church, they'll be more than happy to talk to you further as Christians are we are we coming to Christ day after day you say sometimes I feel dry keep coming to Christ because Christ begins to sap that dryness keep coming to Him through the means He has provided that you might grow together as a body. Father we pray that the things we've considered from your word will work deeply in us and bear fruit to your glory we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Amen.
