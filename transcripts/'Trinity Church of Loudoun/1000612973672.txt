It was September 23rd, 2001, and the location was Foxborough, Massachusetts. The New England Patriots were actually one of the worst teams in the NFL at the time, and their one glimmering hope at the beginning of the season was their three-time Pro Bowler quarterback, Drew Bledsoe. It was week two, and it was late in the game when the star quarterback, Bledsoe, was hit hard by Jets linebacker, Mo Lewis, sidelining Bledsoe and forcing the Patriots to bring in their young, sixth-round pick and largely untested backup, Tom Brady. At the time, the fan base in New England was understandably very nervous about losing Bledsoe, their star quarterback, and what that meant for their already struggling franchise. And yet, despite how committed the fan base was to Bledsoe at the time, despite how much their hope and what they had known up to that point, and despite how unfamiliar they were with this young buck from Michigan, what would become utterly apparent to everyone in time was that whatever hope the Patriots fan base had in Bledsoe would soon be far eclipsed by Tom Brady for the next 19 years. Tom Brady would far outshine and far exceed whatever expectations that Patriots fans had placed in Bledsoe. And to put it another way, the glory of the latter, Brady, would far outshine the glory of the former, Drew Bledsoe. If you have your Bibles, you can turn to Hebrews chapter 1. For those of you who are here on New Year's Day, I preached out of Hebrews 1, verses 1 to 4, where we talked really about the first major theme of Hebrews, which is the supremacy of Christ. The supremacy of Christ over all things, in fact. The writer of Hebrews, he's speaking to a Jewish audience who are new converts to Christianity, and yet, for most of them, there still is a temptation to adhere to the old covenant and to the former Jewish sacrificial system. And so the author of Hebrews is writing to exhort and to encourage his Jewish audience to see that Christ is supreme and that he is actually the fulfillment of all these things, and that the old covenant is actually giving way to a newer and better covenant in Christ. And so there are four things in particular that the author feels the need to address with these newly converted Jewish believers. And the first 10 chapters of Hebrews unpacks these four things in particular that Christ is supreme over. So what are they? Well, back in January, we said that, number one, Christ is supreme over angels, that Christ is supreme over Moses, that Christ is supreme over and fulfills the priesthood, and that Christ, lastly, is supreme over and fulfills the Old Testament sacrificial system. Again, each one of these would have been a really tough pill to swallow for first century Jews who were raised on a steady diet of the law and Torah and sacrifices, and, of course, a deep reverence for Moses and the patriarchs. And so the writer of Hebrews has his work cut out for him. And so our plan for today is we're going to continue with the first of these four things that the author addresses, namely, that Christ is supreme over angels. Christ is supreme over angels. Now, many of you might hear this and think, okay, a sermon on angels. Why angels? Why does the author of Hebrews feel it necessary to tell us that Jesus is better than angels? Isn't that obvious? Well, whether you realize it or not, our very own Matt Felton has spent the last few months building a case for just how significant a place angels would have held in Israelite and Jewish thought and culture. We've been walking through Genesis, and in the last few chapters alone, we've seen some incredible happenings between Abraham's family and angels, right? In Genesis 18, we saw that the three angels of the Lord visited Abraham and his wife Sarah by the Oaks of Mamre. So we have this incredible picture of these divine beings sharing a meal with them. And not only that, they reiterate the promise of a child, despite their old age, and then foretell of the coming judgment on Sodom. The very next chapter, Genesis 19, we see two angels miraculously visiting Lot, protecting his family, and ultimately saving their lives from impending judgment on the city. We see many other examples in the Old Testament of biblical figures interacting with these divine beings. An angel guarding the way back to the Garden of Eden in Genesis. Jacob wrestling with the angel of the Lord. Daniel, Ezekiel, and the other prophets all having incredible experiences and visions involving angels. Finally, back in December, when Matt preached on Mary and the angel Gabriel visiting Mary, Matt helped us to see that angels were the ones ordained by God, messengers, sent to proclaim the good news that the Messiah was coming. So we saw that in one sense, the angels can be understood as gospel proclaimers, tasked with heralding the arrival and the work of the Messiah. The New Testament takes it even a step further by telling us that angels had a direct hand in being God's messengers who delivered the law to us. Galatians 3.19, it says, Why then the law? It was put in place through angels by an intermediary. Acts 7.53, you who received the law as it was delivered to us by angels. Incredible stuff. Even John the disciple in the book of Revelation, so amazed at the sight of the angel speaking to him, falls down to worship the angel twice, to which the angel then says, don't do that. Worship God. So see this, church, for two millennia, all throughout their history, as a people and an ethnic group, the first century Jews viewed angels as holy, divine messengers who brought God's revelation, who delivered the law, and who supernaturally protected and delivered God's people on multiple occasions. And then out of nowhere, suddenly there comes this guy named Jesus who appears on the scene, who's supposed to be better than angels, not to mention Moses and the priesthood and sacrifices. So you can see how it's going to be a hard sell to your average first century Jew. Not hard for us, right? We have 2,000 years of Christendom and church history and teachings on the divinity of Christ behind us, but for them, the Christian movement would have still been so new and so unfamiliar. So this task that the author of Hebrews has before him as he highlights the supremacy of Christ over all things, including angels, is a big one. And so here's what we're going to do for today, is we're going to walk through Hebrews chapters 1 and 2. It's going to be a high flyover, a lot of text, as you saw. Great job, Mark. And look at two movements that demonstrate how Christ is supreme over angelic beings and why it was so important that the author of Hebrews addresses and speaks to this issue. So we'll look at our first movement in Hebrews chapter 1, and then we'll observe a brief gospel warning, an interlude of sorts, in Hebrews chapter 2. And then we'll dive into our second movement in the bulk of chapter 2. Let me pray for us again one more time real quick before we dive into our text. Father, would you help us now as we move to Hebrews? Help us to see, give us eyes to see and ears to hear what you have to say to us this morning. Thank you, God, for the gift of your word. Amen. So movement number one is what we're going to pick up, which can be found in Hebrews 1, verse 4. Let me read verse 4 for us to start. It says this, having become, talking about Jesus, talking about the supremacy of Christ, having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs. So immediately we see the statement that Christ is superior to angels, and the author bases Jesus' superiority on the fact that his name is more excellent than angels. So verse 4 really acts as the heading for the first movement that we're going to look at, and that is this, movement number one. Christ is supreme because of his name. Christ is supreme because of his name. Many of you are probably aware that God has many names, as we see all throughout the scriptures that highlight the depth and the breadth of his character. And a quick aside, one of the reasons I love Hebrews so much is it has this incredible ability to take different concepts from the Old Testament and bring them all together with beautiful gospel cohesion. And that's exactly what the author is doing here. Now in these verses, speaking on the names and the work of Jesus, and how his various titles substantiate his authority over angels. So what are some of these names? Let's keep going. Verse 5. It says, to which of the angels did God ever say, You are my son. Today I have begotten you. Or again, I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. So it begins with a rhetorical question, implying that the father hasn't said this, spoken this to angels. But we see the author quoting Psalm 2 in the Davidic Covenant in 2 Samuel 7, using the language of sonship. Right? I have begotten you. I am a father, and you are my son. So we see here our first name, the Son of God. A name that is far more excellent than angels. One of the most obvious and yet intensely personal things that I need to speak to my children often, is that I'm their father. And that they are my sons and my daughter. Right? How important is it to their identity as members of our family that they know this and hear it often? Extremely intimate language that the father validates Jesus by calling him son. Verse 6. And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says, let all God's angels worship him. So the first thing that really stands out here is the title, firstborn given to Jesus. There are so many implications for this title, and nuances in how to interpret this word, and what exactly the author is getting at. And yet the main idea here that is essential that we walk away with, is that Jesus ranks first. This word speaks to the priority and the rank of the son above all else. Again, that Christ is supreme. And if there's any question about that, then the angel's response in the next verse clears it up for us, right? Quoting from Deuteronomy 32. Let all God's angels worship him. In response to his divine sonship and rank as firstborn, what's the only appropriate response? It's worship. It's awe. It's adoration. And if the angels are worshiping him, then the implication is that the reader too, should worship the son as supreme above all. Firstborn is also a subtle allusion to our second movement in chapter two, but we'll get there later. Let's keep going. Verse seven. Of the angels he, God the father, says that he makes his angels winds, and his ministers a flame of fire. But of the son, he says, your throne, oh God, is forever and ever. This scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom. You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness. Therefore, God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions. So now we see the author for the first time unpacking the role that angels play. And the two words being used here are very interesting, stating that angels are ministers who are winds and fire. Winds and fire, which is strange language. The general consensus here amongst most theologians and scholars are two primary things. First, as winds and fire are often divinely sent by God in the Old Testament to accomplish God's purposes, so too are angels sent by God to accomplish his purposes. Secondly, wind and fire, though powerful forces in the hands of the Lord, they are not in and of themselves eternal in nature. Like angels, winds and fire are created, finite things that are used by God for his purposes, instruments in his hands. So what's he getting at? Well, so too as winds and fire, angels are powerful instruments sent and used by God and their roles throughout redemptive history is significant and important. And yet, when we look at the two side by side, angels and Christ, the glory of angels pales in comparison. The glory of the latter far outshines the glory of the former. And verse 8 continues to highlight this sharp contrast. Look what it says, one of my favorite passages in Scripture, because what we see is it's unique in that it's the father so worshipfully extolling the son. The father says to the son, your throne, O God, is forever and ever. The scepter of rightness is the scepter of your kingdom. You have loved righteousness, hated wickedness. Therefore, God, your God has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions. Here, the author of Hebrews quotes from Psalm 45, and really just hits on a multitude of implicit titles or names that are often ascribed to God alone. The father says this first. He says, your throne is forever. Right? Well, this connects the Old Testament name that represent God's eternality. That is El Olam, Olam being the Hebrew word for eternal. He speaks of the scepter of your kingdom, the scepter, of course, connecting to God's kingly rule and reign. And the Old Testament name this connects to is that of El Elyon. We see the language of anointing oil, which connects to the Hebrew word Mashach, which means Messiah, the anointed one, the one who has been anointed to come and bring salvation to God's people. Right? So the author's being so strategic here in the quotes that he uses, because every Jew reading this would have been so familiar with these truths about God and how the language here of Psalm 45 connects to these names of God, a name that is more excellent. Verse 10. And you, O Lord, you laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning and the heavens are the works of your hands. So see this, the father just continues to the lavish praise on the sun. He says, you laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning. The heavens are the works of your hands. We said this back in January with the first Hebrew sermon that Jesus is the creator of the universe. John chapter one also speaks very clearly to this. So now we see the title or the name of creator being given to Jesus. Just another name added to the list, right? The father continues verse 11 and 12. He says, they will perish, but you remain. They will all wear out like a garment, like a robe. You will roll them up like a garment. They will be changed, but you are the same in your years will have no end. They will perish referencing back to the temporal nature of the created order. Another contrast that's being painted painted here. They will perish, but you remain, right? They will wear out like a garment temporal, but you are the same in your years have no end eternal. So here is the author is quoting Psalm 102. Again, this touches on the eternality of God, El Olam, as we already saw. Another really significant idea presented here is that God is unchanging and the name that probably best connects to this idea is God's most intimate name that we see in the Old Testament, which is Yahweh. Yahweh used interchangeably in Exodus 3 with the name I am, which is always present tense and always self-existent. Signifying God's complete eternal, perfect, unchanging existence. The great I am right. We really do lack the words, but I am in Yahweh used interchangeably in Exodus begin to get at this idea of God's unchanging nature, his immutability. Verse 13. And to which of the angels has he ever said sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet? Are they not all ministering spirits sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation? Again, the author begins asking the rhetorical question, implying that God the Father, he doesn't speak like this to angels. And he says, sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool. This is a direct quote from one of the most Messianic Psalms that we have. Psalm 110. And it speaks explicitly to the work of Jesus conquering sin, death, and Satan, his enemies. And so this idea, likewise, connects to one of the biblical biblical names of God. That being El Gabor, which means a mighty warrior or a conqueror. He has made his enemies a footstool for his feet. And now he's seated at the right hand of God, the father El Gabor, the name of one who has conquered. And then finally, in verse 14, again, we see this contrast between Christ and angels. Angels are sent to those who would inherit salvation, whereas Jesus is the author of that salvation. And in just a moment, we'll see more of how he authors our salvation in the second movement. This great salvation. So all throughout chapter one, see this. The author of Hebrews is compiling all of this data, right? On Christ and the various names, comparing and contrasting the angels, all which fits under the heading in verse four, that says that his name is more excellent than the name of angels. Right? So this is our first movement. Christ is supreme because of his name. His great name. And then in chapter two. So before we get to our second movement, what we have here is a quick but crucial interlude between movements. Okay? And what is known as our first warning passage in the book of Hebrews. Hebrews has five warning passages spread all throughout the book, throughout the letter, this being the first. And let me start by just reading these four verses for us. It says this, verse one. Therefore, we must pay closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it. Right? There's the warning. For since the message declared by angels proved to be reliable, and every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution, how shall we escape? If we neglect such a great salvation? It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was tested, and it was attested to us by those who heard. While God also bore witnesses, witnessed by signs and wonders, and various miracles, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, distributed according to his will. So the author begins by saying, look, we've got to pay attention to what we've heard, this message. We can't drift away from the message that was declared to us by who? By angels. Remember, as we said earlier, angels were the messengers sent by God to declare God's revelation. As we saw, Paul and Luke even going so far as to say that they delivered the law to God's people. But wait a second. What salvation is the author talking about that we shouldn't drift from, that was delivered by angels? Is it salvation by the law that God, through angels, delivered at Sinai? Remember what the author of Hebrews is doing, right? He's compiling all of this Old Testament data in order to show how Christ is the fulfillment of all of it, including how he fulfills the law and how the supremacy of Christ, his divinity, and even the Spirit in verse four relates to all of these things, right? So here the author in this warning, he's giving us just a quick peek at the treasures that will come later in the book of Hebrews. The author of Hebrews is beginning to allude to not neglecting this great salvation that comes from persevering in faith in Christ. Don't neglect this great salvation. Don't neglect it. Don't drift from it. And what we'll see is that with each of these warnings, as we move through the book of Hebrews, that this central message, persevering in faith in Christ, will only continue to grow and then crescendo later in chapters 11 and 12. So here he's, he's priming the pump, right? He's giving somewhat of a veiled gospel warning that the Hebrews must hear as the author is trying to reorient them away from the glory of former things and helping them to see now the glory of Christ, how the old covenant gives way to the new, and how this salvation comes through persevering in faith, not law following, right? The glory of the latter is beginning to outshine the glory of the former. And just a quick bit of commentary on the warning passages, since we're here, and since they are key to the overall idea of Hebrews. I love what Herman Bavinck says in the warning passages. He says this, all of the above mentioned admonitions and threats, warning passages, that scripture addresses to believers, therefore, do not prove a thing against the doctrine of perseverance. They are rather the way in which God himself confirms his promise and gifts through the believers to the believers. They are the means by which perseverance in life is realized. Helpful bit of commentary on the warning passages. So the message is this, right? Don't neglect this great salvation, which we're going to continue to expand on now as we get into our second movement. Again, movement one, Christ is supreme because of his name. And then now, movement number two, Christ is supreme because of his work. Christ is supreme because of the work that he does, that only he could do. Let's keep going. Verse five, chapter two, says this, for it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come, of which we're speaking, and it has been testified somewhere. What is man that you are mindful of him, or the son of man that you care for him? You made him for a little while lower than the angels. You have crowned him with glory and honor, putting everything, everything in subjection under his feet. So this is a really interesting text now. Again, right off the bat, we see the author contrasting angels, but this time he's contrasting angels to man and to humanity. Verse five, right? It says, it's not to angels that God subjected the world that is to come. Okay. So, so who is the world been subjected to? Who is the world been given to for its stewardship? Well, it's man. We saw this in Genesis. It's humanity. And Psalm eight being quoted here makes that obvious to Psalm eight. So clearly speaks to the Lord, putting all of creation under man's stewardship. It wasn't given to angels. It was given to humanity, to steward and to ensure that God's knowledge and blessing would spread from Eden and cover the earth. And yet humanity fell. And what was intended to be man's good and righteous rule over the earth became perverted, fallen, and a shadow of what God designed it to be. And the end of verse eight, even alludes to the shadow that has now been cast over man's rule. It says at present, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him talking about mankind. So this is the problem. And the only solution for man to be restored back into fellowship with God and restored back to his intended position of holy stewardship over creation was for one to come. One who is like a son of man. One of the important themes of Psalm eight that we see in verse two and verse five of that Psalm is that God uses what is weak to shame the strong and to accomplish his purposes. Psalm eight two, it says this out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies, you have established strength because of your adversaries, right? In God's economy, it's the weak and the needy and the humble whom the Lord chooses to exalt and uses to accomplish his purposes. And it is precisely this attribute of God as seen in the work of Jesus, the son that the author of Hebrews now prepares to zero in on with laser focus as he comes to the climax of his argument and why Jesus is supreme over angels. Look at verse nine, the work of the sun, a work that no angel could ever do. But we see him. Who for a little while was made lower than the angels, namely Jesus crowned with glory and honor because of the sufferings of death so that by the grace of God, he God, he might taste death for everyone. For it was fitting that he for whom and by whom all things exist. Remember creator and bringing many sons to glory should make the founder of their salvation perfect through suffering. Reminds me of Philippians to what we just read that famous early church messianic him. He who counted equality with God, not a thing to be grasped, but he emptied himself. He took the form of a servant coming in the likeness of men in flesh. And so because of his suffering, he has now been crowned with glory and honor, taking upon his shoulders, the full penalty of humanity, sin wrath from the father, a burden only God incarnate could fully bear and yet come out victorious. And in doing so, the ones whom are all things and through whom are all things. What is he done? Verse 10. He has brought many sons to glory. Many sons and daughters ransoming to himself, a people, a body, a church. The author of salvation, the suffering servant. What angel could do this? What angel could do such a work on our behalf? There is no other and there is no other name under heaven by which man can be saved. The perfect author of our salvation through his suffering. And we see it again here, right again. Those echoes of Psalm 8 strength and exaltation coming through weakness and humility. But he doesn't just save his people. He doesn't just declare us righteous. No, he he sanctifies his people. He transforms his people. Verse 11 and 13 through 13. For he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one source. That is why he is not ashamed to call them brothers saying, I will tell of your name to my brothers in the midst of the congregation. I will sing your praise. And again, I'll put my trust in him. And again, behold, I and the children of God that he has given to me. So why is it? That Jesus is not ashamed to call us brothers and sisters. Because Jesus is the one who sanctifies us. Who makes us more and more like himself conforming us increasingly into his image. As it says in Philippians 1 6. I'm sure of this that he who began a good work and you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ. It will happen. He will bring to completion the work that he is doing in you. And he will prepare you for the good work that he has for you for his glory for his kingdom. So because of his good work. And that it's effective and then it will not fail. And because God is faithful to his name and will make good on his promises. Right think all the way back to Genesis 15. Christ is not ashamed to call us brothers and sisters co-heirs with Christ. He will complete. He will finish that work. And I love verse 12 and 13 quoting from Psalm 22 and Isaiah 8. It's a picture of Jesus the son now speaking to and worshiping God the father. Right so it's like this circle of Trinitarian praise going back and forth between the father and the son. Jesus is now worshiping the father and he's next to us. We're with him his brethren whom he is now faithfully sanctified because of his work his redemptive gospel work. And so now all together Jesus and his brothers and sisters aka his bride are all declaring in one unified voice. We will proclaim your name. We will sing your praise. We will put our trust in you. Verses 12 and 13. Incredible fruit of Christ's work that we can worship alongside the son the father. Verses 14 and 15. Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood. He himself likewise partook of the same things that through death. He might destroy the one who has the power of death that is the devil. And deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery. So Jesus takes on flesh. He had to be made like us in order to redeem us. Fully man and yet still fully God. And in doing so he delivers the death blow to death and the devil. Right first Corinthians 15. Oh death where is your victory? Oh grave where is your sting? But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through Jesus Christ our Lord no longer slaves but free. Verse 16. For surely it is not to angels that he helps but he helps the offspring of Abraham. So again comparing man to the angels in the sense that it's Christ's work that is efficacious for them. For salvation for redemption to those who are descendants of Abraham by their faith in Christ. As Paul shows us in Galatians and Romans. And again we see the idea of persevering in faith. That's that theme now though still in its infancy. Though further as we move through the letter it will continue to take center stage in Hebrews. But the Lord helps the descendants of Abraham by faith you and me his church. And lastly verse 17 and 18. Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect. So that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God to make propitiation for the sins of the people. For because he himself has suffered when tempted he is able to help those who are now being tempted. The third time we see this language of Christ becoming like us taking on flesh. But now he's assuming the role of a priest. But not a priest that needs to continually offer sacrifices such as in the Old Testament. But one who his one sacrifice is sufficient to atone for good once and for all. Chapters 9 and 10 of Hebrews unpack this in greater detail. But a merciful and a faithful high priest who came to once and for all make propitiation or atonement. For the sins of the world the sins of man. And then I think in a very appropriate pastoral ending to this chapter this great text on Christ's work. It says this it says because he was tempted as he took on flesh and entered into our lowliest state. He then is now able to help us in our temptations. Man how many of us need to hear this today. That God is with us in the midst of our temptation. That he comes to our aid. That he helps us. That he meets us in the midst of our sin and temptation in the midst of our wanderings. And what a work Trinity. No angel could do this work. No only infinite God could have authored so great a salvation. So movement to again Christ is supreme because of his work over angels and over all things. As we wrap up I think my encouragement to us is this today. Is that we would labor to abide in and to meditate on and to stand in awe of his name and his work every day. That we would make time to stand in awe of his name and his work every morning every evening. Because like these these first century Jews that he's writing to the temptation is too great to look to past glories. Or to hope in other glories that captivated us before Christ. The temptation is too great to forget all that he's done for us. To neglect this great salvation. And yet despite that he promises to come to our aid when we're tempted. He comes to our aid when we're tempted to latch on to our former ways of living. Our former ways of doing things perhaps even our former patterns of religiosity. What former glories might we be holding on to that the Lord is calling us to lay down and to surrender to him. Oh that we would see him and have our eyes open to the deep deep depths of his love for us. Our adoption our sonship. May we see the worth of his name in the expanse of his work every day with fresh eyes. Enclosing the Lord mightily used angels his ministers as messengers and lawgivers and gospel proclaimers to warn and encourage and save the people of God. And yet when Christ came he came in such power and in such might that his glory would far outshine the glory of anything else that came before him. The glory of the latter which far outshine the glory of former things. Let's pray. Father thank that you have chosen to reveal yourself to us. We praise you for this. We have your word. And then we have clarity on how these things all these puzzle pieces fit together. You show us how the son is Lord over all supreme over all infinitely worthy. God like the Jews those first century Jews struggling to understand some of these things. Would you help us oh God to surrender. Our hopes. The former glories that we were. Infatuated with. Even the idols. That tend to crop up in our hearts oh God. Would you help us may we be a church body that honors and brings you much glory in all these things. We pray this in your name. Amen.
