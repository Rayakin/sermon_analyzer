I wonder how many of you were wondering whether or not to write that down or... The story of Genesis so far, as we pick back up where we left off almost a year ago or like eight months ago or something like that, the story of Genesis so far is the story of sin and of promise. It's the story of sin entering into our world and into our human race through Adam and Eve who fell in the garden to the deceitful schemes of the serpent. But it's also the story of promise as God responds to their sin in judgment, yes, but also by making promises and most especially by making a promise that some descendant from Adam's line would someday be born, would come into this earth and would defeat the devil, defeat the serpent and undo this awful curse which has come into our race on account of sin. It's the story of sin. It's also the story of promise. And so every time we meet a new character in this story, we're watching and we're wondering if they, this new person, is the promised one. Cain and Abel and Seth and Noah and Shem, we've all wondered as we've met each one of them one by one as they rise, but then we watched them fall and they die and it wasn't them. That's led us to this point in the story to Abram, another seed, another son, another potential. And God has entered where we left off last time we were in Genesis. God has entered into some kind of special relationship with Abram. He called Abram when he was 75 years old to leave behind everything he'd ever known, his family, his friends, his home back in Ur of the Chaldeans, and to set out for a new land. And God has set upon Abram his promises. So if you have your Bible, go ahead and turn to Genesis 12. If you're not there, at the beginning of Genesis 12, God makes to Abram special promises. And there are three promises that I want you to see, and you're going to hear these repeated again and again throughout Genesis. I talk about these promises all the time. Christmas Eve, if you were here, I mentioned these three promises if you were paying attention. The three promises God made to Abraham, number one, place. God promised to give to Abram a land, a home, place. Secondly, a people. God promised to take Abram, this one older man, and turn him into a nation, a people. And blessing. The third promise was blessing. Cursed are those who bless you, and cursed are those who curse you, God sealed upon Abram. In you, in you, Abram, all the families, all the nations, all the peoples of the earth will be blessed. That's the language, that's the promise of salvation. Place, people, and blessing. Those are the promises God has given to Abram, and now Abram has made it into the promised land. And there, in the city of Bethel, Abram and all his posse stopped and set up a camp and built an altar, and together they worshiped God. Abram preached and proclaimed the name of the Lord, Genesis says. Look at chapter 12, verse 8. From there, we're now in the promised land, Abram moved to the hill country on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent with Bethel on the west, and Ai on the east, and there he built an altar to the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord. That phrase, called upon in the name of the Lord, is a significant phrase in Genesis. It can just include the idea of praying, it also can include the idea of proclaiming, of preaching. Abram's in this foreign land with these foreign strange people, and their foreign strange God, and he stands up with all his posse, and they proclaim the name of the Lord, Yahweh is God. And so the story of Genesis is now focused upon Abram, and all of our hopes are attached to Abram. He's made it home into the promised land. He's declaring God here in his new home, and in him, in Abram, God has promised that the nations can find their way back home as well. That's where we pick up this morning in Genesis 12, and for the first time, but certainly not the last, all those promises are put into jeopardy. And so I'm going to tell you this story, which we've already read together this morning. I'm going to tell you this story in three sequences. First Abram's test, second Abram's danger, and third God's test. So this story, three parts, Abram's test, Abram's danger, and God's test. And the main thing I want us to see from this adventure of Abram, which we're going to follow many adventures of Abram who becomes Abraham. The main thing I want us to see from this story this morning is the danger of self-trust and the safety of trusting in God's promises. The danger of self-trust and the safety of trusting in God's promises. So first let's look at Abram's test, famine in the promised land. Look at verse 10. Now there was a famine in the land. And so Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land. Now you can't just skim over that verse. Verse 10, Abram left everything he knew behind to set out for the unknown for a foreign land inhabited by a strange people. And he did it all for God. He did it to obey God and to inherit God's promises. And as soon as he gets there, there's a deadly famine. Verse 10 says that this famine wasn't just any famine, it was severe, the latter part of the verse reads. There's something deeper in this verse that I want you to stare at because we all need to grasp this as we seek to understand Abram and as we seek to understand ourselves. Abram's faith was immediately put to the test. He has not even finished unpacking his bag yet. And there's already a severe famine in the land of promise. What I want you to see is that this is not unusual or exceptional in the life of the people of God, and that includes in your life. For those whom God calls and for those who express faith in God, testing, trials should be expected. Jesus, the Lord Jesus himself, he was baptized. Massive moment, right? If you remember in Mark's gospel, the dove hovers over Jesus and the voice of heaven calls out, this is my beloved son with whom I am well pleased as God the Father sets his seal of approval upon the son as he's baptized. The very next verse, Mark chapter one, reads that immediately, Mark says, the spirit drove him, drove Jesus out into the wilderness. Why? So that he could be tested by the devil. Immediately, literally the next verse, baptism. This is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased. And the spirit drove him out into the desert to be tested into the wilderness. As one writer put it, faith is regularly followed by famine. If you're a Christian and you're seeking to live a life of faith, enjoying God and seeking to obey God, then you are going to be tested. You're going to be given some trial, and let's be honest, often trials, plural. And you'd be wrong to assume that it's going to come at some later date when you're ready and mature enough to handle it. You'd also be wrong to assume that you've already been through trials, and so now you're just going to hit cruise control and just kind of comfortably coast into heaven. Just think of your life since you've followed Jesus if you're a Christian. Where have you been tested? How have you specifically been tested? At work? In your marriage? Finances? With your children? Loss you have experienced? Suffering? Or how about, how many of us would just immediately go for D, all of the above? And you can sit and I can sit and we can analyze until we go mad. What was God and what was the devil and what was me and what was you, but that won't change anything about God's purposes in every trial of your faith. James 1 verses 2 through 4, I read for you by way of reminder. For you know, beloved, that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. Tests, trials, are invitations to lean into God, to test Him in a way, as an anchor. Now I know the Bible says don't put God to the test, but there's a right way to test God and test His promises. Fling yourself wholly upon Him, whatever you're going through, and see if He'll prove faithful Will He keep His promises? Will He be enough for you and satisfy you when everything else fails? And James promises that if you'll let that have its full effect, God will grow you. God will give you the gift of steadfastness. God will make your faith more sturdy. He'll make your life more godly. And so what should Abram have done? He should have stayed right where he was in the land of promise, and he should have kept right on worshiping God and praying for food. Just like Noah waited in the boat for dry land, didn't move until God gave him exactly what He told him He was going to give him, Abram should have waited in the promised land for some meat. Do you think God brought him all the way into the promised land and gave him all these promises just to starve him a few weeks later? Of course not. But Abram's stomach was growling, and his eyes were seeing no food, and his eyes were seeing everybody else flee the famished desert of the promised land for the supple riches of Egypt, watered by the Nile. And Abram's fears were awakened, and those fears grew larger, and eventually they grew even bigger than the promises of God so that Abram's eyes were blinded. That's how fear works. Watch this. Life's harsh realities, which we all face, grow bigger and bigger until they eventually crowd out and choke out and become even bigger than the promises of God. Think about your anxieties. Many of us struggle with anxieties. Think about your anxieties. What's happening? You know what God's Word says and what God's Word promises to you. You're okay. You're forever okay in God, in Christ. God is ruling over your life. He's working all things together for your good. He takes care of the birds and of the lilies, and those things are nothing in comparison to you, His image bearer who He loves, who He gave His Son for. He doesn't love those things like He loves you. But your fears, your triggers, they present themselves as bigger realities than they really are and as they deserve you seeing them as, just like Alice in Wonderland where time and space and objects grow larger and then smaller in her mind than they are in reality. So now your fear and my fear feels like it's the biggest truth and biggest reality in the entire universe and you can't see anything else beside it, including God's promises. We've got to fight our fears with God's promises and ask the Holy Spirit to take God's promises from God's Word and make them bigger to our hearts and bigger to our minds than our distorted, oversized fears. That's the fight of faith. Maybe Abram reasoned to himself here, God's promises rest on me, a nation is going to come for me, I've got to preserve my own life, I've got to go to Egypt. Whatever the case may be, he took matters into his own hands. He lost sight of the God of promise and he fled to Egypt for food. Fear for Abram gave way to flight. How many of us run the second things get hard? I've said so many times preaching to this church, what do we miss out on when we press eject the second things get hard? What good purposes designed by God, a gift of God on the other side of your trial, do we miss when we so hastily, so consistently press eject the moment things get hard? In family, in friendships, in the local church, half of Paul's letters are addressing conflicts, some of them really serious, some of them really petty. In those tiny little New Testament churches, we just bounce the second there's anything awkward and at what cost, I want to ask? What pot of spiritual gold is on the other side of awkwardness with another church member that you've got to get through? Abram's faith, like ours so often does, gave way to his fears and he fled. Oh, but it gets worse. Look at verse 11. When he was about to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai, his wife, I know that you're a woman beautiful in appearance, that's pretty good honestly so far, compliment your wife, beauty. And when the Egyptians see you, they will say, this is his wife, then they'll kill me but they'll let you live. Say instead you are my sister, that it may go well with you, with me because of you and that my life may be spared for your sake. Abram, like so many characters in this story and one still to come in Genesis, shows himself here to be cunning, sly devil Abram. He foresees a problem, he concocts in his own mind a brilliant solution all on his own, doesn't need God's help, doesn't need God's consultation, he's even got cover for his conscience. Sarai, we read in Genesis chapter 20 verse 12, actually is Abram's half-sister. That's weird, it's a long time ago. It's the Bible. He's not lying in a technical, legal, Bill Clinton kind of way. Can I say that? That's probably way still too soon, still political. He's not lying in a legal sort of way. But what could be more deceptive than this half-truth? What's happening here? Sin is leading to more sin. Abram's fear gives way to Abram's flight, gives way to Abram's deception. You have to sin, you see, to get out of your other sins. You all know what I'm talking about, we've all been here. You have to sin to break free from your sin. I'm sinning now because of my other sin and I got to get out of that or so we believe such lies. For Abram, sin leads to more sin and sin puts him in danger, grave danger. So let's look secondly at Abram's danger as he experiences trouble in Egypt. Look at verse 14. When Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman, his wife Sarai, was very beautiful. And when the princes of Pharaoh saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house. And for her sake, he dealt well with Abram. And he had sheep and oxen and male donkeys and male servants and female servants and female donkeys and camels. He gave them all to Abram. Now I want to stop here before I kind of move forward in the story. I want to address something, a really strange elephant in the room that'd be easy to ignore and I'm tempted to ignore, but two of you are going to wonder about this. And so I'm going to make the rest of you to wonder about this and be weirded out by this just to satisfy the two of you who are already wondering about this. Sarai, Abram's trophy wife, is 65 years old at this point in the story. Now that's around the age of my mother. Just a little bit this way. And I just want to say that when I go for a stroll with mom in Harris Teeter, I'm not typically too terribly worried about what the fellas in the grocery store are going to say or whistle or do or something worse. My mom is going to absolutely love this when she listens to the sermon podcast tomorrow morning. So this is just strange. I want you to see, and to some it sounds legendary, mythical. Was Sarai, just as one writer suggested, an inordinately young 65, like we all hope to be someday? Well remember, at this point in the story and at this point in human history, humans are living longer. We saw earlier in Genesis, there's a pattern Moses clearly shows of as sin is infesting the world and taking over humanity. Lives are getting shorter and lifespans are getting shorter and shorter and shorter. So it looks like sin is winning, sin is conquering. So Methuselah lived to 969 years old. But eventually where the story lands is where we are today. Lifespans are somewhere roughly 70 to 80 years old. Moses writes a psalm, Psalm 90, and in it he reflects, our lifespans are 70 years old or even by reason of strength, 80 years old. Well here with Abram, who would become Abraham, and the fathers were sort of stuck in the middle. So Abram lives to 175 years old. Sarai lives to 127 years old. What am I taking from that? I'm inferring from that that just as lifespans were roughly, at this point, double the age of ours, the aging process was probably roughly half as slow, meaning Sarai at this point is probably roughly equivalent of a woman in her mid-30s today. Now you all know, now the two of you are perhaps satisfied, and lastly in conclusion I want to say again that I really do think my mom is lovely, and I really, I really don't want you to bring this up to her and make her feel more uncomfortable than she's already gonna feel. Abram has a masterful plan. In this culture, if dad was out of the picture, then the brother was the recipient of marriage dowries and wedding gifts to secure a bride, and so Abram has not only thought of a way to save his own neck, and again he's the man of God's promise, he's just looking out for God's cause, right? He's also crafted a plan to make himself a little prophet in the meantime. You see, marriages were a process, and so it seems likely that Abram's thinking is that he's gonna market, I might even use the word pimp, Sarai around wherever he goes as his hot sister. Have her catch a suitor or two or five, they win her hand and she agrees to marry them, they make payments to Abram, her brother, and then they get out of Dodge before the wedding day. We've all seen that movie like five times. It's just a classic little con, and Abram's thought it all through except one thing, he makes one, there's one flaw in his plan. What's the flaw in his plan? He actually underestimated Sarai's beauty. In verse 11, Abram says, I know, to his wife, I know that you are a woman beautiful in appearance. In verse 14, the Egyptians see this foreign woman and they say, they see that she's a woman who is very beautiful. Not beautiful, very beautiful, Sarai's beauty in fact causes such a stir in Egypt that word gets back to Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt. In ancient Egypt, rulers took many wives for many reasons, and so a woman discovered to have something that the Pharaoh would desire, that could be political power in the form of an alliance with a foreigner, a foreign person from a foreign government, or in Sarai's case, beauty. He would take her and join her to his palace, Pharaoh's harem, and put her into a process along with many others of becoming one of his wives. You can see in verse 15 that Sarai was taken into Pharaoh's house. It was a personal brothel of sorts for politics and for pleasure. And just like that, Abram's in way over his head. Things look okay at first, maybe even for the best, Abram's now receiving gifts from Pharaoh after all, look at all of his bounty here. He's used his wife to protect himself, and now he's put her in harm's way. He's subjected her to unspeakable abuse and shame, let's not just glide by that. And if he's found out now, and really, it's not if, it's when, right? Because our sin has a way of always finding us out, doesn't it? Sooner or later, it's a matter of when and how long and just how bad will things be. Have you ever really gotten away with your sin? I'm not sure that I have. Maybe you think you have, maybe you're still covering up something right now, thinking you can manage it. I want to assure you that you can't. You will be found out sooner or later, and God already knows. When Abram's found out, he now faces great danger, even death, and maybe even the death with him of this promise from God, which leads us thirdly to God's test. Abram's test, Abram's danger, Abram's test failed. How about God's test, where faithfulness is on the line? Abram is tested in this passage. Verse 10, again, now there was a famine in the land, now that's obvious. You can't read the story and miss that. If you read the story in preparation for this morning, I'm sure you caught that. Abram's being tested here by God. If you've ever heard a sermon on this passage, you've surely heard that. Abram, the man of faith, faces his first serious test. The first of many, and he fails. Not the last time he'll fail either, and his failure jeopardizes everything, his life, his offspring, his promises, God's blessing. But there's another test in this story. It's more lurking in the shadows so that you might have understandably missed it, but it's actually the most important feature of the story. It's actually what the story, and the story of Genesis even, is all about. I think what you're supposed to see here, and what's really supposed to cause you and me to wonder at this passage, is the test being put to God. God has just made promises, big promises. Genesis chapter 12, let me actually read for you the promises. Look at chapter 12, verses one through three. I've already summarized them for you. Let's actually go back and read them together. Genesis 12, beginning in verse one. Now the Lord said to Abram, go from your country, and your kindred, and your father's house, to the land that I will show you, and I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great so that you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed. Those are the promises of God made to Abram. Place people blessing. Can we say it all together? Place people blessing. Abram has immediately wandered, and his actions, his fear, his flight, and now his deceit, have immediately jeopardized all of God's promises and all of God's purposes. Do you see that? What's really being, who's really being tested here? Abram's faith, yeah, and it's already failed, and it's flimsy, it's even real at all at this point. What's really being tested here, though, is number one, the strength of God's promises, and number two, the reliability of God's character. Will God's promises hold before Pharaoh? Will God's promises hold before Abram's betrayal? Will God depart from Abram and remove his blessing from him? It's sort of like the husband who takes a wife in marriage, and the week of their honeymoon, say, he finds out that she's been unfaithful to him. She's betrayed him. We would all understand if he left her. That's what's being put, that's the situation God is in here now. He's found a covenant partner. He's cut promises with them, and the partner has immediately failed God. Everybody would understand if God backs out, so what happened? Look at verse 17. Abram's in a mess. He's gonna die. His wife's gonna suffer a fate worse than death. Verse 17, but the Lord, you gotta see those words. The chorus of redemption throughout the entire Bible and Genesis, everywhere begins with those words. But the Lord, but God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses and sins, has made us alive together in Christ, Ephesians 2.4. But God afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife. And so Pharaoh called Abram and said, what is this that you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife? Why did you say she's my sister so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife. Take her and go. And Pharaoh gave men orders concerning him and they sent him away with his wife and all that he had. God plagued Pharaoh and all of his house, not for the last time, a lot of heavy foreshadowing here. And he did it in such a way that Pharaoh discerned Abram and Sarah's deceit. The word plagues here typically refers, the word actually means large diseases normally of the skin, boils like we meet later in Exodus. So it seems likely that everybody in Pharaoh's harem, everybody in Pharaoh's palace broke out in this plague, everybody except Sarai. Wasn't too terribly hard for Pharaoh or anybody to figure this one out. Pharaoh picks up on what's going on and he confronts Abram with Sarai. When you read the exchange between the two of them, who looks like the more righteous and the more moral man? Godless, evil Pharaoh does. Even he cannot believe Abram's deceit and yet he's obviously afraid of Abram's God now and so he doesn't punish them but neither does he tolerate them any further. He banishes them from Egypt. Here, take, go, the terse Hebrew reads. Away, I don't wanna ever see you again. So watch what just happened. God made promises to Abram and Abram took him up on it. Abram followed him, Abram went out to follow God, left his kindred, his beloved, his known surroundings and went to a foreign land because God made promises. God tested Abram, immediately God tested him. Abram failed, took matters into his own hands, fear, flight, deceit. But God plagued Pharaoh, protected and defended Abram and took them safely back to Canaan and took them safely back to Canaan, the promised land. Mind you, with more wealth, more people, more possessions than before. Why? That's the question we should all be wrestling with in this passage this morning. Why did God do it? Why did God protect Abram and judge Pharaoh here? Abram, I'm trying, I hope you see, Abram certainly didn't deserve it. There's no hidden meaning. Oh, Abram's actually being really righteous here. No. He's no better than Pharaoh here. In some ways, he's worse. Why did God do it? What if some were unfaithful? Does their faithlessness nullify the promises of God? Let God be proved true, though every man a liar. Romans 3, 3 and 4. Against you, David prays, and you alone have I sinned and done what is wrong in your sight so that you may be justified in your judgments and proven right in your words. Psalm 51, 4. If we are faithless, he, God, remains faithful, for he cannot deny himself. 2 Timothy 2, 13. Do you see? Do you see why? God did it. Why did God do it? God did it because God is God. And because nothing in all the universe is stronger or more secure than the promises of God. God did it to defend God himself, though every man be proven a liar. And covenant breaker, surely not God. If God's promises depended upon us, none of them would ever come true, for we'd compromise them all. This, us and God, this journey of faith cannot be a partnership, at least not a true one, because we just take and ruin every single time. We'll never uphold our end of the bargain. Now, please don't let the devil twist what I'm saying in your hearts right now. He'd love nothing more than to do that this very moment. Your obedience is not irrelevant. Our sin can have grave consequences, as we've already reflected upon this morning. There's a point at which our persistent unfaithfulness and disobedience clearly calls into question our faith. I preach about this virtually every week. Christians serve God. They follow God. They fall down, they wander off the path sometimes, but they keep marching forward because they have the Holy Spirit and they're kept by his power. But I'm gonna talk a lot in the coming weeks from Genesis about faith, about true, real, saving faith, just like in James. And one of the things you've gotta see from this story and listen to me carefully is that your faith cannot be in your faith. Sometimes when we talk about faith, which saves, right? Because we're not Catholics and we know that it's faith, not works, right? Well, sometimes when we talk about faith, which saves, we end up just staring at and talking about the strength of our faith so that our hope is now in what? It's in our faith. And you know what that is? When we do that, when we talk like that, when we believe like that, I'm gonna say something that I hope shocks you. That's works righteousness. That's turning faith, which is simply something that grabs and grabs onto something stronger. That's turning faith into a work, which earns us favor with God. No, friends, the story that we're supposed to learn from the story of Abram and so many other places in the Bible given to us by Moses, why? To show us how this all works. Abram's faith, whatever it is at this point, it falters, it falters badly. But the thing that Abram's faltering, weak, backsliding faith was hanging onto even barely was the best thing that he could do. Dead rock promises of the unchanging, never failing, promise keeping, faithful God. Not faith in faith, faith in God, faith in Christ. If you're here this morning and you're not yet a Christian, is there anybody in the world you trust like that? We generally can rely on moms. It's as good as it gets, as safe as it gets statistically. No offense, dads. Moms usually stick by us forever, but even moms have limits. What if you could know and enjoy a God who always keeps his promises even when you blow it? And for the people of God here this morning, the church, I wonder what promises of God you've lost sight of before the trials and dangers and hardships of your life in this world. That God will never leave you nor forsake you. That the peace of God which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus. That God will supply every need of yours according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus. That the testing of your faith is producing perseverance and steadfastness. That God is, yes, indeed, working all things together for your good. That if you confess your sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. That he who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will raise us also with Jesus and bring us into his presence forever. That he will give to us in the resurrection new bodies, glorified resurrection bodies. That God himself will be with us, wipe every tear from our eyes, wipe every tear from our eye, take away every pain or sickness or death we've ever felt forever and we will always be with the Lord. I didn't make any of those promises up and I just scratched the surface. They're all recorded to you if you're a Christian in God's word and purchased by the blood of Jesus. And so, Abram, if you look at chapter 13, verse one, just a little postscript on this story and the sermon this morning. So Abram went back up from Egypt. He and his wife and all that he had and lot with him into the Negev. Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver and in gold. And he journeyed on from the Negev as far as Bethel to the place where his tent had been at the beginning. Between Bethel and Ai, remember? Back in 12, eight and nine, to the place where he had made an altar at the first. And there Abram, once again, there Abram called upon the name of the Lord. The episode ends, the story this morning ends with Abram back in Bethel, back in the land of promise. By God's mercy, he's made it back to where he began, back to where he's supposed to be. And once again, he returns to his tents, he returns to his altar and he worships God. He proclaims once more the name of the Lord. God is king, you can trust him. You can look to yourself or you can look to God. Abram had to learn that lesson and he's gonna have to learn it again because he's a lot like us. But Abram made it out of Egypt, back home and alive. Why? One reason, because of the strong promises and good character of God. Those promises held and Abram was held by them. Eventually, those promises did produce a nation, people, Israel. They too, like Abram, had to be rescued out of Egypt. And finally, way fast forwarding in the story, those promises produced an heir in the Lord Jesus Christ. As a child, his parents fled down to Egypt to escape the terror and murderous rampage of Herod before safely returning home. This happened, Matthew tells us why. To fulfill all prophecy out of Egypt, I have called my son, Matthew 2.15. This heir of Abram lived the perfect life we were all made to live but have failed to live. This perfect heir died the death that we all deserved, that he alone didn't deserve and he died it in our place. And this perfect heir was raised from the dead. By his name, the name of Jesus, the blessing of God, the blessing of Abraham comes to all peoples. And by his name alone and faith in his name can we be saved. There is salvation in no other name for there is no other name under heaven by which man may be saved, Acts 4.12. Self-trust is a trap which will lead you nowhere but to death. Trust in Jesus. Today is the day of salvation for all who will call upon his name. God, we pray this morning that you would keep us by the word of your power, by the power of your spirit and your precious promises. God, we pray that you would by your Holy Spirit cause us to believe and believe even more and entirely in the promises you've made to us in Jesus. God, for those who have not yet called upon the name of Jesus for salvation, God, we pray that you would draw them to yourself by your power, the same power which called Abram, the very same power which has called each of us from our graves, our deadness apart from you, our lives of rebellion and sin. Oh God, would you exert that same power over rebellious wills even now this morning and call more to yourself to trust in Jesus, to find, to test, and to prove true all the precious promises of God given to us in Jesus. And we pray all these things in his name, amen.
