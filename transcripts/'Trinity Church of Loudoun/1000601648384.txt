And in Jesus' name, we present our request to you this morning, oh God. God, we pray for the Holy Trinity Church of Warsaw, and we continue to thank you for the wonderful new work that you're doing there in this new church, especially among and reaching the many refugees and those who are displaced from countries due to war and other difficult matters. God, we pray for those who are displaced and who are in their midst. God, we pray that you would continue to provide for them and to make their church into a home that they might find even in a sort of exile, a home among your people and in the gospel. God, we pray for the new evangelistic work that's happening through their leaders at the local universities. God, we pray that you would draw students to this outreach and to these Bible studies. And Lord, we pray that you would bring an awakening and an interest in your word among the students. We pray that some would turn from their sins and trust in Jesus and find salvation in his name. God, we pray for these ones who are considering becoming the first and new members. God, we ask that you would build this church up and help them to further know what it means to know and to live out a commitment to one another and help them to know and to live out what it means to help each other, to follow Jesus. For this season, you have them together in this life, in this world. God, we pray too for Taras and Yulia as they grieve. God, we ask that you would be a rock to them and we pray that you would make the realities and the promises and the hope of heaven so real to them right now as they mourn. God, we pray this morning for those among us who are feeling lonely or maybe feeling like they're overlooked in life, maybe even feeling overlooked this morning. God, we pray that you would help each of us not to look in the wrong places for affirmation and for acceptance, but help each of us, we pray, God, to entrust ourselves to you and to look to you, the God who sees when we're feeling alone or overlooked. God, we pray that many would find the local church, even this church, to be a place of refuge. God, would you make us as a church family more into a place of refuge for those who are hurting or lonely? God, make this a place where all truly are welcomed to the table to share in the fellowship of this body. God, we pray for those who are lonely. We ask that you would remind them from your word this morning that you hear them, that you hear their cries, that you see them, you even see them now. Finally, God, we pray that you would teach us this morning and teach each of us even more now what it means to live and to walk by your promises. God, we relate so much to Abram and Sarai, and God, we pray that you would teach us to repent of our fears and of our anxieties and of our self-trust and self-reliance of our quickness to so often take measures into our own hands. God, help us to repent of these things. God, would you increase our faith this morning that we might live by your word and live by your promises, that we might live by faith? God, where there's haze and fog in our minds and hearts, by your spirit, we ask that you would clear our gaze. God, help us, we pray, to live differently and distinctly from the world around us. Teach us what it means to live by faith, and we pray that you would teach us these things even now as we look to your word, and we ask all these things in Jesus' name, and we'll all say it together, amen. Because it's a bittersweet symphony, that's life. Trying to make ends meet, you're a slave to the money, and then you die. I know some of you can already hear it. I wouldn't at all be upset if those brief lyrics I just recited got that catchy violin hook stuck in many of your heads for the rest of the day, so long as you don't tune out the sermon. Bittersweet Symphony, The Verve, 1997. It's a song about life, and it's a song about the beautiful tragedy that is life, working so hard just to get some money, then just to die. It's a song about triumph and tragedy. It's a 1990s poor man's British pop version of Ecclesiastes, and in a dark, twisted irony, I don't know if any of you have read or heard the story behind the song, but the story behind the song actually, ironically, darkly, perfectly captures the meaning of the song. You see, the song samples from a 1960s Rolling Stones song, which itself sampled from a 1950s gospel song, and The Verve, in 1997, when they came out with their song, they negotiated the rights to use that sample, but not from the Rolling Stones hotshot manager who owned the copyrights for their version of the song, and so when that song blew up, and it was one of the 90s biggest hits, because of it, that album was one of the best-selling albums to this day in UK history, and so as it was blowing up, the Stones' manager sued the band, leading The Verve, leading to The Verve, granting songwriting credits to the Stones, so if you open up the album cover to this day, Bittersweet Symphony is credited to Mick Jagger, and they're members of the Rolling Stones, and also leading to The Verve giving up all royalties to the song to the Stones' manager's record company, meaning that song made millions of dollars on its own, and The Verve, who were basically a one-hit wonder, got no royalties from that song, because it's a bittersweet symphony. That's life, trying to make ends meet. You're a slave to the money, then you die. Genesis 16 this morning, if you're not already there, you can turn there in your Bibles. Abram has the promises of God. We've talked a lot, if you've been here, about three banner promises that Abram has from God cut to him that God is now affirming and confirming. Let's say them together. God has promised Abram what? People, place, and blessing. Maybe you're here for the first time. People, place, and blessing. That's what God has promised Abram. He's gonna turn Abram into a great nation of people. He's gonna give to this people, to these descendants of Abram, a land, the promised land, and upon Abram and upon the people of Abram is the blessing of God, God's salvation. People, place, blessing. Now, when you preach a passage, you sort of have to decide the thrust of the passage that you're preaching. So what's the plot here? And how's it meant to land upon the readers? And what I try to do and what we'd normally try to do is whatever that thrust is, however it's meant to land is how we want our sermon to come off. So if the passage is meant to be a hammer, then I wanna preach a hammer to your hearts. If the passage is coming off and meant from God to us to be a sort of love poem, then I wanna give you a poem in my sermon. Well, this passage this morning is a very difficult one to decide how to preach. It's a tragedy, it's scandalous, but it's also filled with grace, too. It's a story of sin and the awful consequences of sin, but it's also a story of God's surprising redemption. It's a bittersweet symphony. And I wanna show you this morning just two scenes we'll look at. There's two scenes in this passage. The first one is Abram's fall, which takes place in Abram's house and household. That's verses one through six. And the second scene, which we'll look at after that, is Hagar's blessing, which happens in the wilderness, really alone in the wilderness in verses seven through 16. So Abram's fall first, and then Hagar's blessing. Let's look firstly at verses one through six and watch Abram fall, not for the first time, not for the last time, before our eyes. It's been 10 years now in the promised land, 10 years. Our church is not even five years old. It's been 10 years in the promised land. Abram's turned 85 now. Happy birthday, congratulations, Abram. And in Sarai, his wife is now 75, even by patriarchal lifespans. We're now getting up there in age and beyond the normal age of childbearing. We've seen Abram wrestle now with the darkness of doubt through different episodes in his life as he awaits the promises of God. Now we find in our passage this morning that the dark clouds of doubt and impatience and restlessness and anxiety have come to Sarai. She's been thus far quietly, faithfully in the background and at Abram's side. She's risked her own life for his own fears down in Egypt. Remember in chapter 12 during famine when Abram schemed to give her over in a way to Pharaoh to protect his own skin? Now she breaks her silence in the story, Sarai does, comes out of the background and gives voice to her own fears and doubts. Look at verse two. And unhatches a plan of her own here. Let me read for you again verses one and two. Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had borne him no children, but she had a female Egyptian servant whose name was Hagar. And Sarai said to Abram, behold now, the Lord has prevented me from bearing children. Go into my servant. It may be that I shall obtain children by her. And Abram, we read, listened to the voice of Sarai. Here we learn for the first time that Abram and Sarai have a young Egyptian servant named Hagar. Now where did she come from? First time appearing in the story, where did this Egyptian slave girl come from? Well, back in chapter 12, you can actually turn there if you want to. I wanna show you this just really quickly. We'll go right back to chapter 16. But back in chapter 12, remember, Pharaoh, once a plague broke out upon him because of God's protection for Sarai and Abram, Pharaoh banished Abram and Sarai from his midst and from Egypt, but he banished them with a large loot. So we read in chapter 12, verse 16, of these many possessions that Abram was banished with, we read in verse 16, and for her, that is Sarai's sake, he, Pharaoh, dealt well with Abram. And he had sheep and oxen and male donkeys and male servants and female servants, female donkeys and camels. Female servants. Note the irony here. If you wanna go back to Genesis 16, Sarai's own beauty and loveliness earned from Pharaoh a bounty, including servants, one of whom surely was probably a very, very young at the time, Hagar, maybe a child of 10 or so years. So Abram leaves Egypt with his wife, Sarai, good and protected and alive, thanks to God, and now a rich man, so rich, remember, that his nephew Lot and he almost go to war with each other because they're overcrowding the land and so that they have to be separated and so that now, chapter 16, one of the servants is going to nearly destroy his marriage. Those riches from Egypt have proven to be quite a snare, haven't they? Sarai wants to see this promise fulfilled. She wants that child. And technically, God has promised children. God has, in chapter 15, promised that Abram himself shall bear children, not Eleazar of Damascus. He will not be your heir, Abram. From your own loin shall come your heir, shall come a son. But technically, he's never said that the child of promise will come from Sarai, and she's 75 here. You can kind of track how she rationalizes her sin here. And so she takes advantage of a well-known custom of the day, which we actually, to this day, have historical records from surrounding cultures showing that it was widely permitted and practiced by cultures around Abram. They surely would have known of this practice, where for a barren couple, if they had servants, so for a rich couple, if they had servants and they had no child, it was permitted for the husband to take one of those servants as a second wife for the sake of having a child, who might then become the barren couple's heir. This was permitted by ancient laws. You might remember from ancient Siv 101, Hammurabi's code, remember that? I don't remember what it was, but I remember hearing about it. Well, Hammurabi's code made this sort of exception, and you can find this in there. Hammurabi approved of this. God did not. And so we pick up in verse three. So after Abram had lived 10 years in the land of Canaan, Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her servant, and gave her to Abram, her husband, as a wife. And he went into Hagar, and she conceived. Everything about this is twisted and scandalous. Fathers of the bride, even in that culture, are to give away daughters. Here we read that Abram's wife gives away her servant to Abram as a wife. In Egypt, Abram, in fear, chapter 12, had given Sarai to Pharaoh. Here, in an ironic reversal, Sarai, in fear, gives Hagar to Abram. The way that the author Moses writes here is very provocative. I wonder if you notice. Sarai, we read, took Hagar and gave Hagar to Abram. And then in verse two, Moses says that Abram listened to Sarai's voice. The one who's heard God's voice making promises listens now to Sarai's voice as she offers sin. Does this sound familiar to you? Genesis chapter three, it's amazing how many times this just ripples through the unfolding story. Genesis chapter three, Eve took the fruit and gave some of it to her husband. Chapter three, verse six, and then God curses Adam. Because why? Because God says, you have listened to the voice of your wife. Genesis three, 17. This is given to us as another fall into sin. Abram's fall. And now watch the fallout from this other fall into sin. Verse four, and he went into Hagar and she conceived. And when she saw that she had conceived, Hagar looked with contempt on her mistress. And so Sarai said to Abram, may the wrong done to me be on you. I gave my servant to your embrace. And when she saw that she had conceived, she looked on me with contempt. May the Lord now judge between you and me, Abram. But Abram said to Sarai, behold, your servant is in your power. Do to her as you please. He makes sure that his wife, Sarai, knows that Hagar's still beneath her. And so what does Sarai do? Then Sarai dealt harshly with her so that Hagar fled from her. Notice the relational chaos here. Hagar gets pregnant and she starts to feel superior and so she looks down on Sarai, who is in fact her master, her superior. At least that's the way Sarai sees it. I don't know if this is Sarai's own imaginations as a spurned wife and really hurt, longing to be mother but who's barren. At any rate, Sarai responds by unleashing her fury on her husband who'd done exactly as she asked and gotten exactly what she wanted from this plan. And so Abram basically permits his wife to now sin further against Hagar and that indeed she does, abusing Hagar so harshly that Hagar runs away all alone carrying a baby. Just like when Adam and Eve sin, they hide in shame, they blame each other, they turn on each other and then their son murders his brother. Sin leads to conflict and sin leads to more and more sin and Abram's house, the house of promise, the house of blessing is now a mess. A couple of words of application here for you, for us. First of all, when you sin, not if, when you sin, I sin, we sin, repent quickly. Repent quickly, sin leads to more sin which leads to more sin and then at the blink of an eye, things are entirely out of control and you all know exactly what I'm talking about, don't you? Because we've all lived this and the only way to break that destructive cycle is to repent, that means to stop, confess your sins and turn away from them, turn around and go the other way. Is there strife and fallout that you're even to this day, presently just accepting and living in that you can turn from? Paul says in Ephesians four, do not let the sun go down on your anger and the point there is that you've gotta put an end to this now before it does further damage. Sin's best friends are secrecy and time. Sin grows and festers in isolation and the more time you give it, the larger it grows, the more destruction it causes. When you sin, repent quickly and a second further word of application, I wanna give specifically to husbands here and I wanna say husbands, husbands, lead your wives. In both Abram's fall and Adam's fall, both times, the author of Genesis says, this is not an accident, this is a pattern he's building, both times, the author of Genesis, Moses says, he, Adam, Abram, he listened to the voice of his wife. Now listen to me carefully because I know I just put everybody in the room on edge, husbands and wives. The point of neither passage is obviously not. Wives are foolish, they always lead to sin, so ignore them or you're gonna sin. Of course, husbands should listen to their wives regularly. Wives are God's gift to us if you're given a wife but husbands are called to lead their wives and I wonder what you hear me saying when I say that. I would hope that the first thing you hear me saying if you're a husband or if you're a husband to be someday, you desire to be a husband, has everything to do with spiritual leadership. Abram has heard the voice of God, by God's hand, he's defeated kings and escaped Pharaoh unscathed and God has walked him by the hand to assure him all these promises of God. Now how quickly he just falls asleep at home before his wife's fear and unbelief. No, Sarai, God has said that the stars, he had me count the stars, Abram should have said. I've counted the sand, God swore on himself, Abram should have said. But he falls asleep. Husbands, God's word calls for you to lead your wife. Now you might say, many might say, well, yeah, but she's more, you don't understand, she's more spiritually mature than me and honestly, I do understand and a lot of the time, that's quite obviously true and good for her but all you just said is that you've got a lot of growing to do spiritually. Yes? The point is not that you've gotta be above her spiritually or in any other sense. The point is you wanna walk together and grow together but God has called you, husband, to love your wife, to lay down your life for your wife and in this way, to lead your wife. So time to grow up in the Lord. Wouldn't be the worst time for some husband out there to say amen. Grow in godliness, men, because there's nothing more important in the world than our growth in godliness and grow in godliness, husbands, so that you can be the sort of man that a wife would want to follow as you follow Jesus. Abram and Sarai want these promises so bad and here, they try to speed them up and they try to make their own shortcut and look at where it's taken them. Right now, if you leave this room in this parking lot and you drive straight for Poolesville, Maryland, I don't know why in the world you would do that but let's just say you wanna go to Poolesville, Maryland. No offense if any of you here this morning are visiting us from Poolesville, Maryland. Really glad you're here but if you leave this parking lot and drive straight for Poolesville, Maryland, it's gonna take you, I just checked, 40 to 45 minutes without any traffic. That's in spite of the fact that right now, from where you're sitting, you are exactly eight or eight and a half miles from Poolesville, Maryland, which is right over there, I think, right over here, there, somewhere, as the crow flies. Eight or eight and a half miles, 45 minutes, no traffic. Look at the map, don't do it now but there's no way, if you look at the map, that that should be 45 minutes. And here's the deal, you can try to make it shorter. You can try to take a more direct path. You can try to just go this way to Poolesville, Maryland but if you do that, you're gonna be off-road and you're gonna destroy your car trying to make it through bushes and trees and woods and if you make it through bushes and trees and woods, at some point, you're gonna find yourself coming to the edge of the Potomac River and if you try to cross that, your car is gonna drown and you might drown with it. Your best bet, as frustrating as it is, is to hop on 15, drive all the way north up to Point of Rocks, Maryland, cross this human-produced bridge which is stationed above the water safely and then hop onto 28 and drive all the way back down to Poolesville, you'll be there in 45 minutes. It's not how you would have designed the highways but it's safe and it's definitely best. God's ways are rarely fast. Never how we would design them or design our own lives. His promises often seem slow to bud. They often test our patience and our faith and listen, they're meant to. But they're always best and he's always good and trusting him is far safer and far better than trying to make our own way. God does not need our help. The second scene in our passage this morning shifts from Abram's tumultuous home to the wilderness where we find Hagar all alone but met by God. So let's look secondly at this second scene and look for Hagar's blessing. Nobody in this story, in this chapter, in this episode really comes out so great but of the three main characters here, Abram, Sarai, and Hagar, all involved in this terrible household drama, I would argue that Hagar by far comes out the cleanest and furthermore is by far the most sinned against. In this culture, she has no choice or say in this matter once Sarai gives her over to Abram. She's not a temptress, she's not a seductress here like Potiphar's wife we meet later in the story of Genesis. She's merely a servant obeying her master and then after she does exactly what her master asks of her, requires of her really, she's afflicted for it and she's afflicted so badly that she chooses to run away, a young woman all alone bearing child, she chooses to run away into the dry, brutal wilderness of the Middle East. We catch up to her in verse seven, outside of Shur, the text says. That is at the border of Egypt, the same area mind you where we read later in the story that Moses is leading and has to lead Israel through the wilderness of Shur during the exodus. Only Hagar, Moses is setting his people free coming from Egypt back to the promised land through the wilderness of Shur. Hagar is going the opposite of direction. She's escaping the promised land and clearly she's making it, trying to make it to Egypt, back home. How sad this privileged, most blessed servant woman, almost property in Egypt but she's made it into the home of the blessing of the people of God and now she runs away for abuse. She's made it all the way to Shur but she's stalled out there in thirst and stopped by a well for a rest and for a drink of water and there at the well she's met by an angel. Look at verse seven. And so the angel of the Lord found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, the spring on the way to Shur and he said, the angel said, Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from and where are you going? Hagar said, I'm fleeing from my mistress, Sarai. So the angel of the Lord said to her, return to your mistress and submit to her. The angel of the Lord also said to her, I will surely multiply your offspring so that they cannot be numbered for a multitude. Now just pause here before we pick up and continue the rest of the story and finish this chapter. I wanna invite you for just a moment to stare at this mysterious angel of the Lord. This is the first time we meet this character in the Bible, but it's the first time of many. And angel here just means messenger. So it reads literally Yahweh messenger or messenger of the Lord. First of many encounters in the Bible and in the story of the first five books of the Bible. And one of the characteristic features of this strange, powerful figure, the angel of the Lord, is that he's often confusingly, very confusingly on the one hand, described on his own terms and as distinct from the Lord, from Yahweh. So he is the angel of the Lord. He's not the Lord, he's the angel of the Lord. But confusingly, on the other hand, he's often and consistently then described as though he's Yahweh himself. So in Exodus three, Moses at the burning bush, very famous scene. Moses encounters, we read at the beginning of the chapter, this flame and there we read is the angel of the Lord. But then who speaks to Moses from that burning bush? God does. So the angel of the Lord, but then is sort of taken over by God. You can see here in our passage, the angel seems distinct from the Lord at first. Verse seven, again, he's introduced as the angel of the Lord. Not the Lord, he's the angel of the Lord. But then again, as the passage moves on, he speaks like the Lord speaks. He speaks as though he's God. Verse 10, the angel says, I will surely multiply your offspring. Those are God promises. God's been making those promises to Abram. These are God's words. Verse 13, the author, Moses, says that it was the Lord who spoke with Hagar. Not the angel of the Lord, the Lord. And Hagar evidently agrees. Verse 13, she names the one speaking to her the God of seeing. So the angel of the Lord speaks to her, but then she calls him the God of seeing. Are you confused yet? I think your brain is supposed to be just a little bit juggled here and in passages like this. And I think what the author is trying to do here is awaken curiosity and excitement and questions in your imagination. You can understand why many across history have identified this angel of the Lord as none other than the second person of the Holy Trinity, the pre-incarnate Lord Jesus Christ himself. At any rate, verse 11 continues, and the angel of the Lord said to her, behold, you are pregnant and shall bear a son. And you shall call his name Ishmael because the Lord has listened to your affliction. He shall be a wild donkey of a man. His hand against everyone and everyone's hand against him. And he shall dwell over against all his kinsmen. So she called the name of the Lord who spoke to her, you are a God of seeing. For she said, truly here I have seen him who looks after me. Therefore the well was called Beer Lahai Roy. It lies between Kadesh and Bered. And Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram called the name of his son whom Hagar bore Ishmael. Abram was 86 years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram. The main lesson of this story is given here at the end of the story in rapid fire. And here Moses telling the story chooses to tell you the point of this story through the names which come at the end. What's the point of this story? What's the meaning of this message? What are you supposed to take away from this? You find that out, you unlock this puzzle by the names. Ishmael means God hears. Hagar the Egyptian gives to the God who visits her a name, El Roy, the God of seeing. And the well where she was met by this God is given a similar name. Beer Lahai Roy means something like well of the living one who sees. God hears, Ishmael, God hears. God listens to your afflictions. Listen to Exodus 2, 23 and 24. During those many days the king of Egypt died, and the people of Israel groaned because of their slavery and cried out for help. And their cry for rescue from slavery came up to God. And God heard their groaning. And God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob. Psalm 34, six, the psalmist writes, this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all of his troubles. I know many of you in this room this morning have cried out to God for years in pain and in confusion and in your own affliction. And when you cry out to God in your affliction, when you cry out, how long, oh Lord, why God? And when you do that in faith and in submission to the God who hears you, yes, indeed, God hears you too. And by the way, that goes for you this morning. That goes for you too if you're here and you're not a believer or not yet a believer. If you'll cry out to God in your sins, God hears you too and God will deliver you. God has never denied anyone who has ever cried out to him in sincere faith. And so cry out to God even if you're not yet safe in God and he hears you. And Jesus died and his blood is powerful enough to cleanse any and all who will cry out to him in faith. Amen? And let me say too for your encouragement, Hagar here is all alone in the wilderness until she's met by God. We too are in our own wilderness of sorts. The New Testament calls us in the church sojourners, wandering along in our own wilderness of sorts on our way to heaven. But we ourselves are not alone, unlike Hagar. At least we need not be. God has given to us the church and I would encourage you if you're a believer who's afflicted, who's crying out to God and wanting to be heard, let the church join you in your affliction. Some of my favorite testimonies that I get the privilege of hearing regularly are from those who found comfort and help, water and bread, by sharing their afflictions, by confessing their sins and by seeking help from their fellow church members. I heard more of those testimonies this week. They always bless me. I can't wait to hear more. I hope that's your testimony. I invite you even this morning if you're afflicted and you're feeling alone to make that your testimony by inviting others to share in your affliction. We want to help. God hears and God sees. Hagar calls God a God of seeing. God indeed does see. Everything about this woman, Hagar, is as we would say against all odds. She's a woman in a patriarchal culture. You see how easily in this story she's taken advantage of. She's a servant girl. She's a slave to Abram and Sarai. She has no rights. And she's even called repeatedly in the passage what? She's called Hagar the Egyptian. She might as well be called Hagar the not my people. Hagar the enemy of God, the enemy of God's people. She has no rights in this story. She has no status. Really, she has no place in this story. If we didn't have her name here, she really belongs back in chapter 12 verse 16 among the possessions that Abram inherited along with the sheep and the goats. Unnamed, unmentioned, overlooked. You ever feel overlooked and like you don't matter? Friday night we always go to get pizza and watch a princess movie with my four little princesses and this Friday night I asked one of my littles if she would go in to pick up the pizza. We already ordered it. We already paid for it. I parked the car right by it. You just gotta go in and get it. I'm teaching them responsibility even as I'm saving myself a few extra walks. And so I asked one of my littles if she would be willing to go get the pizza and she said no that she couldn't because she was afraid that if she got to the counter she's so short that nobody would be able to see her. Now that's cute, isn't it? But that doesn't really go away as you get older, does it? You might get taller but this fear and this feeling of being overlooked, that sticks with many of us for the rest of our lives, doesn't it? Ever feel like you're always off in the background and like if you disappeared nobody would really notice? Maybe some of you feel like that within your own family. Kids in the room, kids often feel that way during childhood, that's very normal to feel overlooked. Like it's a grownup's world. All these giant trees out there, it's their world and I'm just sort of in it and maybe overlooked. Some of you feel like that at work. Some of you feel like that, and this is heartbreaking, some of you feel like that in church, even in this church. But God saw Hagar. You know how some people do these studies on the names of God? I know some of you guys have seen these things, the different names of God, Jehovah Jireh, God provides, Jehovah Rapha, God heals. Some preachers do sermon series through the names of God. Some people do, I think like Beth Moore, other famous people like that. Lots of studies out there about the names of God. Some people even put the names of God on their walls to remind themselves and some people pray through the names of God. Jehovah Rapha, God of healing, heal me. In those lists and in those studies and in those sermon series, one of the names of God that always makes the list, even if it's a shorter list, is El Roy, the God of seeing, the God who sees me. And Hagar the Egyptian gave that name to God. I want you to just stop and reflect on that for a moment. Hagar, the Egyptian servant girl, alone, thirsty, probably about to die with a baby in her womb in the wilderness, gave that name to God because she couldn't believe it that the God of Abraham saw her. Can you believe it? Of course, the sense of the God of seeing here is the God who sees me. Not a God who just sees everything. Yeah, that's true theologically, but the point is the God who sees me and he sees you too. However short you are or however introverted you are or however weak you are or alone you are or backslidden you are or exhausted you are or young or old, God sees you. And he gave Jesus to die not to solve some heavenly math equation of sin and death that couldn't be worked out without the cross of Christ. Yeah, that's technically true, but he gave Jesus to die because he saw you in your sins and because he wanted to rescue you just like he wanted to rescue the Egyptian servant girl, Hagar, in the wilderness. God sees, he's the God of seeing. And so Abram now has a son. At 85 years old, he finally got his son. And how do you feel about it? How did Abram feel about it? He so clearly, Ishmael, so clearly not the son of blessing. He's like a wild inverted circus mirror parody of the promised heir of Abram. We'll read in chapter 17, he's gonna father 12 princes just like the 12 tribes of Israel. Here we read a wild donkey of a man, his hand against everyone. He's not bringing peace like the child of promise is meant to bring, he's bringing war. And yet, on the other hand, he has God's blessing or at least part of it and so does Hagar. Chapter 17 makes that explicit. God makes him too, Ishmael, who's not the child of the promise, God makes him, blesses him, turning him into a great nation. Hagar and Ishmael, this entire story is so, you can see why I couldn't decide how to preach this, right? It's so confusing, so many mixed signals, scandal and grace, blessing but perversion. Ishmael, blessed but also cursed, a bittersweet symphony. And how should we respond to it? What should you do with this over lunch as you hopefully discuss the sermon over lunch and what God's word is doing in your life? My favorite Old Testament passages to preach are the ones which are preached in the New Testament, picked up by John or Peter or Paul and preached in the New Testament because then they just do the work for me and they tell me how it's meant to be preached and they're way better at this than I am and I get to cheat off of their notes and not feel bad about it, that's a good kind of cheating and Paul, in fact, preached this story and this passage, Genesis 16 and Galatians 4, you might remember from our time in Galatians. So let me read for you from Galatians 4 as we close and let's see how an apostle inspired and carried along by the Holy Spirit would preach this passage of Hagar and Ishmael and Abram and Sarai. Galatians 4, tell me, you tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not listen to the law? For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman and another by a free woman. But the son of the slave, Ishmael, was born according to the flesh while the son of the free woman, who we haven't met yet but his name is Isaac, was born through promise. Now this may be interpreted allegorically. These women, Hagar and Sarai, are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai bearing children for slavery. Her name is Hagar. Now this is confusing but here's all Paul is preaching here. Let me preach it to you. There are two ways to live. You can live in freedom or you can live as a slave. You can live under grace or you can live under law. You can live under the new covenant or you can live under the law and the enslavery of the old covenant at Mount Sinai. You can live by faith in God's promises or you can take things into your own hands. You can wait on God with Sarai, your wife of old age or you can take Hagar now, do you see? Two ways to live. Which more characterizes your life? God doesn't need any help from Abram, from Sarai, from you, from me. Trust his promises, wait upon the Lord. He always comes through. Let's pray. God, forgive us because boy, we really do. Too easily, too often go the way of Abram and Sarai here and take things into our own hands and try to control outcomes and try to get ahead of you and we get so impatient by waiting and by not seeing and by the slowness with which you sometimes work and so we try to make shortcuts ourselves, oh God and we try to look to means and alternative measures that you haven't approved and which aren't clear obedience to your word. We try to do this thing all ourselves and the worst part is God, sometimes it works and we get what we want or what we think we want but it's not what you intend for us. God, give faith this morning. Increase faith in all your people this morning. Help us to wait upon you. Help us to believe you at your word and to believe that your ways and your promises are always true and are always better than what we come up with on our own. God, we pray yet again as we close. Indeed, would you make us distinct and countercultural in this way? Make us a people who are known for waiting and who live by another word from this world. We pray these things in Jesus' name, amen. Amen.
