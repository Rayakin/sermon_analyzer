There are no happy endings. Endings are the saddest part. So just give me a happy middle and a very happy start. Shel Silverstein. You guys remember Shel Silverstein? How in the world does that guy with that philosophy of life end up, of all things, as a children's author? I'm sure many of you are familiar with his books. I grew up having the giving tree. You guys know The Giving Tree? Read to me. And so it's just one of those books. It was read to me, and so we now read it to our kids. And I was thinking about The Giving Tree last night for really weird, random reasons, because it fits where I'm going with this introduction. And I asked one of my kids, my older kids, where's The Giving Tree? Do you know where it is? And she went and found it, and I pulled it out, and I sort of read it to refresh myself with the story. Do you guys know the story of The Giving Tree? And my nine-year-old said, Dad, you're not gonna read that tomorrow, are you? I was like, I'm thinking about it, why? She's like, it's horribly depressing. And it is, if you know the story. A tree and a boy, and they're happy together, and then the boy grows up, and the boy basically takes all the apples and then all the branches from the tree and leaves the tree behind, and the tree's sad. And then the boy comes back, still older, and wants to build a boat, and so cuts down the entire tree. I'm spoiling the story. He cuts down the entire tree, has a boat. The tree's just a stump now, and a really sad stump, and the boy has no time for it. And then finally, at the very end, the boy comes back as an old man, and he's miserable, and the tree's miserable, and he says, I'm too tired to do anything, and the tree says, well, I can't provide anything for you to do, and so he says, why don't you take a seat? And he sits down on the stump. And that's the end of the story, that's a children's story. That's the end of the story. It's horribly depressing, right? There are no happy endings, according to Shel Silverstein. Endings are the saddest part, so it just gives me a happy middle and a very happy start. It's not very Easter-y resurrection news to begin with, but you can understand where he's coming from. If I could give you a bit of free relationship advice, maybe even marriage counseling. One of the more controversial statements that one can utter to a friend, and maybe especially to a spouse, is this. Everything's gonna be all right. Everything's gonna be all right. If you offer that phrase up, it will sometimes be met with rebuke. You can't just say that. Did you listen to anything I just said? You can't just tune me out and say, everything's gonna be all right. I have problems, they're real, listen to them. Like, actually talk about what, everything's not gonna be okay. On the other hand, if you don't offer that phrase up, you will find it a popular request. Try silence, try just listening. And then what do you get back in response to that? Say something, say what? I'm listening. Tell me it's gonna be okay. Marriage is a mystery. Those words can feel cheap. Everything's gonna be all right. In a world with wars and kidnappings and abuse and Alzheimer's and cancer and death, those words just feel like a Band-Aid trying to patch an avalanche. What an audacious thing to say. Everything's gonna be all right. No, they're not. We're all going to attend the funerals of our loved ones. We're all going to slow down ourselves and suffer and die. But they're also, those words, they're also what we most want to hear and what we most want to be true, aren't they? That everything's going to be all right. If only everything was going to be all right. If only happy endings were real. And so to the tomb we go. If you have your Bible with you this morning, you can turn with me to the passage Gentry read for us. John chapter 20. If you don't have a Bible, we have several free Bibles right on the other side of those double doors and on the right. You can grab one now. You can grab one on your way out. And if you don't have a Bible, we would love for you to keep that and read it. These are God's words. But John chapter 20. Jesus has just died on Friday. John picks up the story. John, the author of this gospel, picks up the story early on Sunday morning. We read in the first verse, it's the first day of the week. That's Sunday morning in the Jewish calendar. And so it's so early that it's still dark outside. And with Mary Magdalene, John picks up with Mary Magdalene approaching the tomb of Jesus. Mary's probably there at the tomb to mourn and to pay respects. Think of a person taking flowers and maybe having a quiet moment at the graveside of a lost loved one. Mary has just lost her leader and also her dear friend in Jesus. So she's here presumably to mourn. Ancient Jewish tombs look a bit like, forgive me, but a bit like hobbit homes. Only they were carved of stone and not into the ground and into the hills. So think like sort of carved caves. And inside of this small entryway to a carved cave was a stone slab or a bench where the body was laid and covered in cloths, cloths over the head, and then the face would be exposed and the top of the shoulders down would be covered in more garments. Tombs of the wealthier were rarely, but if you were wealthy, your tomb would be sealed by a large stone which weighed anywhere from 600 to 1,000 pounds. Jesus was not wealthy. He had no place to lay his head, but he was buried by Joseph of Arimathea. Joseph was a Pharisee actually who sat on the Sanhedrin, the ruling religious authorities of the day in Jerusalem. And Joseph of Arimathea was secretly a follower of Jesus. And so when Jesus died, Joseph, a very wealthy man, got permission to take the body from the cross and personally saw to a proper burial as an act of devotion. And so Jesus' tomb is sealed by a stone because a wealthy man has buried him. Mary Magdalene arrives to the tomb early Sunday morning, still dark outside. Verse one, and she saw that the stone has been taken away. And so she's distraught, she's confused, she's upset. She takes off running, verse two says, to find Simon Peter and then John. Again, John is the author of this book that we're reading and his signature, his clever little signature throughout the book, he signs his name with the one who Jesus loved. So you can see in verse three, the one who Jesus loved. That's John's own personal signature. And he signs in that way because he and Jesus were very close friends. There were the 12 Jesus circle, then there was a really inner circle. And even within that circle, John and Jesus had a very special intimate relationship. So Mary bursts in finding Peter and John and tells them that Jesus has been taken. Now, it's interesting, resurrection has not yet crossed her mind. Her fears are, what she says, he's been taken. Somebody's told her, why would she say that? Well, listen to this, grave robbing. Grave robbing was indeed a thing in this culture. We know this from historical records. Corpses were often taken as the dead were often, why were they taken? Because the dead were often buried with costly items and costly garments. What a terrible, awful thing to do, but it was a criminal activity in the ancient Near East, robbing graves to take the expensive items from those graves, especially in a grave like Joseph of Arimathea. So Mary's mind immediately goes to, somebody has come to the grave and taken my Lord. Bad enough that he's died, somebody's now taken him. How awful. And so Peter and John, hearing Mary's tale, they take off running in a foot race, which John lets you know that he easily won. Verse four, the other disciple, the one who Jesus loved, outran Peter and reached the tomb first. Why did he say that? I don't know. It's recorded in holy God-ordained scripture. John outran Peter, and that brings us to this first scene. So I wanna show you, there are two scenes before us in these 18 verses this morning, both at the tomb. And all I wanna do is show you, really, what I wanna do is, my job is to invite you into this story. Like watching a good movie, you get lost in the movie. I want you to come into this story and experience what Peter and what John and then what Mary Magdalene separately and together all experienced in this empty tomb. So the first scene I want us to go into together is John and Peter at the tomb of Jesus. And that's verses three through 10. So if you're a note taker, I'm just gonna show you two scenes this morning. The first scene is John and Peter at the tomb. So John gets there first because he's faster. So he takes a look, look at verse five, and stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in. Then Peter arrives, huffing and puffing in offensive linemen, Peter arrives, and true to form, brush, if you know anything about Peter, brushes right past, get out of my way, John, right into the empty tomb. Peter, same Peter who rebuked Jesus when he announced that he was gonna suffer and die, and then Jesus is, get behind me, Satan. Same Peter who drew the sword and took the ear of one of Jesus' arresters in the Garden of Gethsemane. Again, Jesus, Peter, stop. Same Peter who boasted to Jesus, he, even if all the other 11 fall away, I will never deny you, Jesus, even if everybody else does. And then he denied him three times. Peter, always brash, always bold, always confident, every once in a while right, but for the most part, not. That Peter barges right into the tomb and confirms that there's no body. Verse eight, John, the more timid and less brash of the two, follows Peter into the tomb. John sees, as Peter saw, there's no body, just those linen cloths, those two cloths from the head and from the rest of the body, neatly laid upon the bench, but no body. And it's at this moment, interestingly, we read, look at verse eight. We read, John tells us that he saw and believed. This is so interesting to me. There's something about seeing those clothes actually, which confirmed in John's mind that this was not actually a grave robber because a grave robber surely would have taken those costly garments that Joseph of Arimathea provided. It makes sense, doesn't it? He sees those clothes and he believed. If it wasn't a robber, John thinks, maybe, wait a second, he's alive. And so verse eight says, John saw and he believed. Now I want you to pause with me here, verse eight, verse nine, and think about this. Look at verse eight and then let's look together at verse nine. We read that John saw and believed. And then verse nine says, John admits, for as of yet, they, and he's, we, he means, did not understand the scripture that Jesus must rise from the dead. Now think about this. John, the author of this story, is saying that the light bulb came on here for him and for the others, and he believed in the resurrection. And he's admitting to you, he's admitting to everybody who reads his story as the writer of this story, that up to this point, he still did not understand the scriptures, that the scriptures taught that Jesus must rise from the dead. Now scripture here refers to what we know as the Old Testament, that big first 2 3rds of your Bible. The most of your Bible, that's all the Bible that John and Peter and the rest of the apostles had at this point. The New Testament hasn't been written. And so think about this. John is saying, we did not yet, up until this moment, we did not yet understand the scriptures, the Old Testament, that they testified that Jesus must rise from the dead. Now, if you're here this morning and you're a Christian, interesting question to think about, where did the scriptures, where did the Old Testament specifically teach that the Christ must rise again? If you're here this morning and you're a Christian and you know your Bible, how would you answer that question? Where in all of like this part of the Bible, it's a big part, where does it teach that the Christ, Jesus, must rise again from the dead? One way you could answer that is just by pointing to a few proof texts. So we've been working through Psalm 16 throughout the morning, a very important, famous Psalm, which looks ahead to the days of the Messiah and Psalm 16, verse 10 and 11 says this, listen to Psalm 16, for you, God, will not abandon my soul to shale the grave or you will not let your Holy One seek corruption. You make known to me the path of life. In your presence, there is fullness of joy and at your right hand are pleasures forevermore. Well, that's a pretty good candidate, that's a pretty strong option for where do the Old Testament, where do the Old Testament scriptures teach that the Christ must rise again? The Psalmist says, you won't abandon my soul to the grave. In your presence are pleasures forevermore. You have shown to me the paths of life. That's a good candidate. We could certainly point to other such proof texts hidden in the Old Testament. That big book, there are surely verses here and there, but listen to this. I think what John saw and what the other apostles eventually saw and understood and then preached in the rest of the New Testament and what I want you to see and grasp and believe and maybe preach yourselves was so much bigger than a few random proof texts buried in a gigantic, dusty old book. You see, there's another way of reading that big old book, our Old Testament, and how it all fits together where you read it all from cover to cover and where you notice in that big old book that certain patterns and themes start to emerge and then repeat over and over and over again. Let me just give you a sampling to prove the point. It begins, the story of the Old Testament, the scriptures begins in Genesis. And the stories that we've been reading together, we're preaching, I'm preaching through Genesis on Sunday mornings, most Sunday mornings. Those same stories we've been reading together, thinking about on Sunday mornings. Think about some of the patterns we keep seeing again and again and again of dead wombs from which God miraculously brings life. Sarah, Rachel, how many times? And then the apostles look back on that and say, they're wombs. Sarah's 90-year-old womb, it was dead and God brought forth life. We haven't gotten there yet, but Genesis 22, Abraham and Isaac at the altar. God tells Abraham, he finally gives him that promised son and then he tells him, tells Abraham to take that promised son, put him on the altar and sacrifice him, take his life. Now listen to how the author of Hebrews looks back and reads that story. Hebrews 11 verse nine says, Abraham considered that God was able to even raise Isaac from the dead from which figuratively speaking, he did receive him back. Hebrews says, Abraham got his son back from the dead. It continues, the story does, in Exodus. And in the Exodus, Israel escaping the deadly grip of the Egyptians, the deadly grip, the drowning grip of the Red Sea. It continues in King David, always surrounded, always on the brink of death, but somehow by God's hand, always escaping and then writing Psalms about it. Psalms like Psalm 16, you will not allow your Holy One to see corruption. Psalms like Psalm 71, you have made me to see many troubles and calamities, or sorry, you who have made me to see many troubles and calamities will revive me again. From the depths of the earth, you will bring me up again. It's Jonah in the belly of the fish for three days before emerging alive. Jonah cries out to God. In Jonah chapter two, he prays, oh God, from the depths of the grave, deliver me. It's Ezekiel and the valley of the dry bones, a whole valley filled with ashes and dead skeletons. And then the word of God comes and is preached and raises up a living army from dead bones. It's the testimony of the prophet Isaiah, your dead shall live, their bodies shall rise. You who dwell in the dust, awake from the dead and sing for joy, for your due is a due of light and the earth will give birth to the dead, Isaiah 26, 19. It's the testimony of the prophet Daniel, Daniel 12, verse two, and many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life and some to everlasting shame and contempt. Here's what I'm trying to show you and what I want you to see. It's not some hidden, buried, secret little clue in there about the resurrection, which nobody had a shot about seeing. The whole story is about life. The whole story is about life bursting forth from the jaws of death. It's about death defeating life. The scriptures, the Old Testament are about God bringing forth life from death, resurrection. You see, Peter and John now believe in the resurrection and so now begins a process of the scriptures coming alive to them and we as the church have the joy every Sunday morning and every morning of your life, if you like, of opening up these scriptures and studying them and renewing our minds by them and finding out the surprise of resurrection, of death conquering life, of God raising the dead. The second scene I want to show you this morning and I want us to enter into is Mary Magdalene at the tomb and that comes to us in these final verses, verses 11 through 18, Mary Magdalene at the tomb. In verse 10, you see Peter and John take off, running again back to their homes. We don't know what they're thinking here. Are they looking for Jesus somewhere? Now they know he's alive or what are they doing? We don't know, but they probably head back to their homes to gather the rest of the disciples and tell them the good news. All we do know is that in their haste, they somehow miss Mary Magdalene who is now without them back at the tomb. Actually, if you think about it, if you read this story carefully, Mary, sweet Mary Magdalene goes, flees from the tomb, weeping to tell them he's not there. They run back. Evidently, they leave her behind in the dust. Not exactly a case for gentlemen here. And then in their haste and in their excitement, they leave her once again and they somehow miss her. They don't see her on the way out. Maybe she's not even there yet. And once again, she's there without the two of them. Chivalry is a long history of being neglected by many men, many zealous men. Now Mary gets up the nerve herself to stoop and look into the tomb, just like John and Peter had done and which she hadn't done before. And when she does, when she looks into the tomb, now watch this, she sees two angels. God has arranged for a very special revelation for this most blessed woman. She looks into the tomb and she finds two angels. She looks at verse 12 and she saw two angels in white sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet. Now let me invite you to turn on your biblical imagination because I wanna show you a couple of things. If you've been with us, again, on Sunday mornings preaching through Genesis, you might remember that just a few weeks ago, Abraham was visited by three strangers who turn out to be two angels and then a third man who speaks to Abraham who turns out to be the Lord. It's just so interesting to me that here, Mary looks into the tomb and she sees two angels sitting in there and there's a third man on the scene. She doesn't know it yet, but that man is the Lord, the Lord Jesus. And John very carefully describes here for us the arrangement of those two angels in the tomb resting upon the bench where Jesus' body had previously lay. There is one angel, he says, where the head has been lain or had been lain and another angel where his feet had been lain. Now I wanna show you, Bruce, we've got an image here which may or may not be familiar. Maybe we have an image here. I've got a slide for you guys. Does anybody know what that is? That's the Ark of the Covenant with the mercy seat on top of it. This is Israel's most precious object, most precious artifact. Why? Not simply because of what it contained, the Ten Commandments and more, but because this was the place and upon this mercy seat on the top, this was the very place where the presence of God came and met with Israel and what is erected from the top of the mercy seat? Two angels, one at the head, one at the feet, guarding symbolically the presence of the Lord. Now you can take that down, Bruce. That's fun, that's interesting, but so what? What's the point? I think this scene is loaded with biblical symbolism and imagery and here's the point. That tomb has become an altar because there was the presence of God Almighty. God himself lay there dead. That was no normal tomb. It's become an altar. What a scene God has arranged for Mary Magdalene and given to us by John. And so the angels now speak to Mary, comforting her even as they rebuke her. Why are you weeping, they say. She explains her anguish. They've taken my Lord. She still doesn't understand. She's still confused. She still buys into the grave robber theory. And then perhaps the angels, we don't know, but perhaps the angels motioned to her. Look, turn around and see. And Mary turns and she sees a man who she thinks is the gardener. Now how does she not recognize her friend here? We don't know. John doesn't explain. There are other times in John and in the rest of the Gospels where after Jesus was raised and he's in his glorified state his friends don't recognize him at first. So think about Jesus on the road to Emmaus. He has a long conversation with them before they have any idea who this is. It's their friend, it's their master. There was something about his glorified body that though it was the same, it was also different. Or maybe Mary is just too disoriented and her eyes are too welled up with tears to see clearly. We don't know. What we do know is that she makes her plea to this man who she thinks is the gardener. Help me, they've taken my Lord. Do you know anything about it? Did you take him? And then he speaks to her in verse 16, just one word, her name. Jesus said to her, Mary. And immediately her eyes are open just like John's were open. And she knows who it is and she believes. There's a long tradition in the church identifying Mary Magdalene as a prostitute. But the Bible never actually says that. An early pope, this is a true story. Church history is amazing. An early pope got his Marys mixed up. And the tradition carried for centuries. Many people still believe it. The Passion of the Christ, sure many of you have seen that movie. It still presents Mary Magdalene as a prostitute because a pope literally misunderstood when the Bible flipped from one Mary to the next in one of the Gospels. Just imagine, what if that happened, like your grandma, your mom, like somebody, a typo, grammatical error, prostitute. And so for the rest of your life, for the rest of your lineage, child of prostitute, it was an error. Popes do err. The Bible never says that she was a prostitute. What the Bible does tell us about this woman is that when she came to Jesus, when she first met Jesus, she was being tortured by seven demons. And Jesus, upon encountering her, does not shun her or avoid her. He delivers her. He cast out the seven spirits in mercy, and then he welcomed her as his friend. From that day on, Mary Magdalene clung to Jesus and devotedly followed him. She was a witness to his trial and his beatings. She was there at the cross along with Jesus' mother, Mary, comforting him as he suffered and died. And here she is now at the tomb, the first one on the scene. Of all people, Mary Magdalene, a woman tortured by demons, is the first witness to Jesus in bodily resurrection. And yet, despite all that, she doesn't recognize Jesus at first, not until he calls her name. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me, Jesus said earlier in John 10, 27. This is the story of every Christian, whether we were tormented by demons or enslaved to sin or taking pride in our perfect little moral track record, every one of those paths and every alternative path leads to hell. Trust in your goodness, reject God, ends in the same place, ends in hell, and only Jesus can call us out of that and set us free. I want you to notice the bizarre cast of characters in this story we're reading this morning who are all disciples of Jesus. We have a rich Pharisee, Joseph of Arimathea, a more tender, timid man in John, an impetuous, bull-in-the-china-shop sort of man who denied Jesus three times in Peter, and a formerly demon-possessed woman in Mary Magdalene. What a lineup, and this is the first little sort of church gathering for Jesus, followers of Jesus. Our crowd here this morning, no doubt, is just as varied. Some of you, no doubt, have dabbled in evil and done wicked things that you aren't proud of, and perhaps as a result, you feel uncomfortable even being here. Some of you, others of you, have never missed a church event in your entire life, and you might even feel proud of that. Others of you perhaps were once fervent in following the Lord Jesus, but maybe for different reasons, hardships, sufferings, disappointments, you've sort of cooled spiritually, and yet you're back, you're here this morning. I wanna tell all of you and everything else unmentioned and every single one of you that it makes no difference where you've come from. The Bible is clear. All have fallen short of the glory of God and all have the same offer of hope and salvation. It makes no difference where you've come from. The only thing that matters is, will you hear Jesus calling your name and respond by faith and follow him? Just like Mary did. Her hope is the same as your hope, same as my hope. This is John's resurrection account. I hope you see as we're reading this remarkable story how everything about this account has the character of eyewitness accounts. Do you notice that? There's weeping, there's running, there's confusion. There's a little bit of chaos. That's exactly because, that's exactly what this is. This is an eyewitness account. The author of this account is admitting to his own shame that he was caught off guard and unprepared, that he'd misunderstood his master's teaching even more, that he'd misunderstood the entire scriptures about the resurrection. That's not how you write legendary tales. If you're the author, guess what? You have the number one seat in the house to present yourself however heroically, however bold, however smart, however intelligent, however with it you want to. John has every opportunity to make himself the hero of this story. But aside from a little humble brag about how fast he was, he makes himself out to be a hard-headed fool right along with the rest of the disciples. Why? The first and primary witness here, consider this, the first and primary witness here in John's resurrection account is a woman. Now that might not mean much to you in America 2023, but in this culture, the testimony of a woman did not count. It could not stand before a court of law. You had to have two male witnesses. This doesn't matter for us perhaps reading this, that John has Mary Magdalene as the first witness. This mattered immensely for John's original audience. This would mean that her testimony was dismissed. This would not help John's case. Why would you include her testimony? Why would you put her as the first witness? Only one reason you do that, if it were true. And that's what really happened. Friends, I'm sure there are some of you here this morning who yourselves just maybe aren't sure about this. It's hard to believe that somebody really rose from the dead, of course it is. How do we know that it wasn't some elaborate hoax? We weren't there, I wasn't there, I didn't see him, you didn't see him. And if that's you, I wanna say a few words now. So much more could be said than what I'm about to say, but I wanna say three things or so. First of all, so I wanna speak to you if you're here, whether you're a Christian, Christians struggle with doubt and skepticism, or maybe you're just a skeptic and you're comfortable with that label. I'm gonna speak to you right now. First of all, consider how the movement that we know as Christianity or the church, consider how it begun. Consider how it took off. More than a decade ago, I was eating at a restaurant in a city and I was with several friends and I don't remember how, but somehow we got to talking about our server about Jesus and about the gospel and asked her what she believed about Jesus. And she said to us, I'll never forget this. She said, I don't really have any problem with Jesus. Brace yourself, because what I'm about to say is offensive, but she somehow did, she meant it respectfully. I took it, she wasn't trying to be rude or cast barbs. She said, I basically think of Jesus like I think of Hitler. Yikes, nevermind their messaging and how opposite they were, but her point was, lots of people can, in their lifetimes, create massive movements and massive followings and get them to do whatever they want. That was all she was saying. Now think about that. What is the difference between Jesus and Hitler or Jim Jones or anybody who can gather any large following, lots of people can do that. Lots of people are skilled orators or whatever. What's the difference? There's one crucial difference. Hitler had an entire nation following everything he said, no matter how atrocious it was. He had them all at his bidding while he was alive. And then he died and Nazism dissipated just like that. The remarkable, bizarre thing, unique thing about the church, about Christianity, Jesus dies. He has but a few straggling followers and then after he's dead, then the movement takes off. Do you see how bizarre that is? How could that possibly be? That makes no sense. There's only one reason that makes sense. If they saw him back from the dead and they believed he actually defeated death. Secondly, second of all, consider that of all the people who had a very serious interest in producing the body, the religious powers, the Pharisees, Sadducees, the political powers, the Romans, all of them had a great interest in producing the body. Nobody ever found his body. So it just disappeared? It either just disappeared or your other option is his disciples did this masterful hoax and got away with it. But then why these babbling buffoons who were betraying him just moments ago, why'd they go out and become lions and heroes and martyrs and die for the guy if they knew it was a hoax? That makes no sense. Don't die for something that, a hoax that you yourself, you can do a hoax. I've done hoaxes before, playful, friendly stuff. I'm not gonna die for them, I know it's a sham. They died for this. No body. Third of all, and most important of all, for all of you, whether you're a skeptic or a believer, consider the testimony of the scriptures. Jesus once told a parable of a very rich man who died and he woke up in the afterlife and found himself in hell. So he missed it. He was a selfish man, he was a self-absorbed man, and he found himself in hell. But somehow in the afterlife, in hell, he finds himself able to communicate with, of all people, Father Abraham, who's in paradise. And for the first time in his entire self-absorbed, money-absorbed life, for the first time in his life, really, in his death, he thinks about somebody else. He remembers, wait a second, I have five brothers who are still on the earth, still alive, and he actually cares about them. And so he pleads, he comes up with this great plan, this sort of trick to get his brothers to believe. Abraham, you go, you go tell them. You go tell them to believe, tell them to repent, tell them that this is all real, tell them not to just live like I did, self-absorbed in money. And they'll surely believe, and you can see how he's thinking. He's thinking, what, they see a ghost, they see a man back from the dead. Who could possibly reject that? Abraham's response in the parable that Jesus told, from heaven to the rich man in hell, is as disturbing as it is instructive for us. Abraham tells him, no, I will not tell them. They have Moses and the prophets. If they will not listen to them, Moses and the prophets, what we know as the scriptures, they will not listen, even should a man come back from the dead. I don't care if you're a Christian or a skeptic, the most powerful thing we have, the most powerful witness we have, the most powerful gift you have for your doubts, for your skepticism, is the word of God. Because he has invested his light and his power in it. Now, if you've sat under my preaching at all, you already know how I want to end this sermon this morning. I want to tell you everything's gonna, I'm actually a really predictable machine. If I have an intro, if you've never called on before, kids, sometimes I don't have an intro, but if I do, I try to tie it into the conclusion. I try to, very predictable, I'm a machine, a robot. So I want to end by telling you everything's gonna be all right. But before I do that, I want to raise the stakes a little bit higher. What if I said to you, in the very moment when everything was going wrong, and worst case wrong, not friend, not spouse, sharing a little troubles with you, and everything's gonna be all right, what if in the very moment when everything was spiraling out of control, what if in that moment I told you everything's gonna be all right? What if I came to you after you've spent months preparing and praying and hoping for something big, a job, a breakthrough, a boyfriend, a girlfriend, whatever, and right after you got the devastating news of rejection, I showed up at your door, hey, everything's gonna be all right. What if you came to me right after an awful diagnosis, gave me your report, and I smiled, and I looked you in the eyes and said, hey, everything's gonna be all right. What if at the funeral, where, not your funeral, but a funeral where you're sitting on the front row, the only VIP seating you don't ever want any access to, you're sitting on the front row mourning, I grabbed you at the funeral, right after the ceremony, hey, wink, wink, everything's gonna be all right. You'd ask for a restraining order. Psychopath, this just isn't real life, and this doesn't really happen in real life for the most part, where in our darkest moments, things right then and right there and right on the other side of that turn out to be all right. When it does, when that very, very rarely, every once in a blue moon does turn out, when you're on the brink, when you can't see any hope, so only darkness, and in that moment, something, it's okay. That's the best feeling in the world, isn't it? You've experienced it a few times, not that often, but you've experienced it a few times. What's better than that feeling? It's like waking up from, the closest thing that I get somewhat repeatedly is waking up from an awful nightmare and realizing it was a nightmare. The kidnappers aren't real. I'm not standing in front of 1,000 people and have no idea where my clothes are, right? So that feeling, that glorious relief feeling of, oh my goodness, it's okay, from the darkest moment. We experience it so, so, so rarely, and it's the best feeling in the world. Do you know that feeling? I'm sure you've felt it before. That's the feeling I'm talking about here. Imagine coming to the final act of your life, knowing you're about to die, and somehow, peeking behind the curtain of death and realizing at the ultimate moment of truth, oh, everything is gonna be all right. That's what the disciples experienced here at the tomb. In their darkest hour, they left everything, they lost everything for this man. They put all their eggs in his basket, and he's now died on them. It's over. What fools they are. You only get one life. You ever think about this? You watch these people who make massive mistakes, you know, going on a Ponzi scheme or, you make one life, you spend a decade committing to the wrong, you ruin it, that's it. That's these guys. They went all in with this guy, and he's now died on them. It's over. They're jokes. He was a joke. No, he's alive. It's gonna be okay. Everything's gonna be all right. He reigns. That's this moment, and listen, that's what resurrection means. For all who are in Christ. That's what it guarantees resurrection does for the church. Everything's gonna be all right. Do you see? Joni Eareckson Tata. Some of you know that name? I'm sure several of you are familiar with that name. She is an artist and a writer and a Christian, and a really gifted, really popular artist and writer. When she was 17 years old, she dove into the Chesapeake Bay. She's from Maryland. So she dove into the Chesapeake Bay, not realizing how shallow the water was. She fractured multiple vertebrae and has been paralyzed from the shoulders down ever since she was 17 years old. While rehabilitating, she learned, she taught herself how to paint and how to write by holding a writing instrument, a paintbrush between her teeth. Remarkable. She's 73 years old now. She's still doing it. This is what Joni Eareckson Tata, Joni, that's Joni Eareckson Tata. This is what she said of the resurrection and her discovery of what the resurrection means. I know the meaning of that now, she says. It's the time after my death when I'll be on my feet dancing. Those words are truer than wishful thinking. That's the point of the resurrection. The point of the resurrection is there really are happy endings. And what we all want more than anything else, for everything to be okay, is really real if you're a Christian. They're not cheap words. They're, in a way, they're the truest words ever spoken for a Christian because they've been stamped by Jesus' reign over death. They're blood-bought, death-defying, death-conquering words. They are the story of the entire Bible to weary sinners and tired humans and scared parents and the anxious and dying saints and all of us in Jesus. Jesus is risen from the dead. He's alive. And so everything is gonna be all right. God, thank you for a hope in our lives of suffering and confusion and darkness and so many things we don't know and are afraid of. Thank you for the hope that is the resurrection. God, I pray for the one who's unsure of your word or even more of the hope of Jesus conquering the death and how that could possibly be good news or real news or good news for them. God, I pray that you would, by your Holy Spirit, seal the testimony of your word and of Christ's resurrection to their hearts now and cause them to trust in Jesus. God, I pray for all of us, all of us who trust in you. God, we pray that as we suffer, as we go on through life, as we age, as we parent, as we encounter loneliness and all the other things that you have for us in this fallen world, God, we pray that we would never live without the hope of the resurrection. And it's in Jesus' name that we pray all these things. Amen.
