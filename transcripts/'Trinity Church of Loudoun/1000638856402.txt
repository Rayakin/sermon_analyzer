Ruth chapter 3, Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, My daughter, should I not seek rest for you, that it may be well with you? Is not Boaz our relative, with whose young woman you were? See, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor. Wash therefore, and anoint yourself, and put on your cloak, and go down to the threshing floor. But do not make yourself known to the man, until he has finished eating and drinking. But when he lies down, observe the place where he lies, then go and uncover his feet and lie down, and he will tell you what to do. And she replied, I will do what you say. So she went down to the threshing floor, and did just as her mother-in-law had commanded her. And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then she came softly and uncovered his feet and lay down. At midnight, the man was startled and turned over, and behold, a woman lay at his feet. He said, Who are you? And she answered, I am Ruth, your servant, spread your wings over your servant, for you are a redeemer. And he said, May you be blessed by the Lord, my daughter. You have made this last kindness greater than the first, in that you have not gone after young men, rather rich or poor. And now, my daughter, do not fear. I will do for you all that you ask, for all my fellow townsmen know that you are a worthy woman. And now it is true that I am a redeemer, yet there is a redeemer nearer than I. Remain tonight, and in the morning, if he will redeem you, good, let him do it. But if he is not willing to redeem you, then as the Lord lives, I will redeem you. Lie down until the morning. So she lay at his feet until the morning, but arose before anyone could recognize another. And he said, Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor. And he said, Bring the garment you are wearing, and hold it out. So she held it, and he measured out six measures of barley, and put it on her. Then she went into the city. And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, How did you fare, my daughter? Then she told her all that the man had done for her, saying, These six measures of barley he gave to me. For he said to me, You must not go back empty-handed to your mother-in-law. She replied, Wait, my daughter, until you learn how the matter turns out. For the man will not rest, but will settle the matter today. I often think that night is more alive and more richly colored than the day, Van Gogh. Across the Bible, there are many important scenes which take place in the night. Think about it. Revelation happens, often is unveiled in the night. Think of Abram and Abraham's visions, or Jacob's dreams. Revelation comes from God often in the night, during sleep. Judgment sometimes erupts in the middle of the night. Think of Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis. Think of the angel of death, who appeared in the night at Passover. Also, great escapes happen in the Bible during the night. Lot and his daughters fleeing Sodom and Gomorrah, and the fires hailing down from the heavens. Think of Israel at the Exodus, as the angel of death spared them, and they escaped beginning in the night. Secret conversations are had in the night. Who can forget Nicodemus, the Pharisee, sneaking out under the cover of the darkness to find Jesus, who he was intrigued by, to ask him what he was all about. And they have that famous, maybe most famous conversation in all the Bible in John 3. Also, horribly sinful encounters happen in the Bible in the night. Genesis 19, Lot's daughters fear extinction in their isolation with their father in a cave. There is no other way to have children, and so they get their own father blackout drunk. Each daughter subsequently becomes pregnant, and the first daughter gives birth to a son, and names that son Moab. From him came the Moabites, and from that awful night came the Moabite people, an idolatrous, godless, child-sacrificing people, an enemy of Israel. Similar episode happens again in Genesis 38. This time Judah's widowed daughter-in-law, Tamar, who had been neglected by Judah's sons, and then most recently by Judah himself, Tamar disguised herself as a prostitute and put herself in the path on purpose of Judah, her father-in-law, who was likely drunk, and then more awful things happened. Younger women in both scenes, older men, strong drink, sin never sleeps. Chapter 3 of Ruth, if you're not there, you can go ahead and turn to Ruth chapter 3. It's pretty early in your Bible, but after some big books, I think it's the 8th book in your Bible, right after Judges, right before 1 Samuel. Ruth chapter 3 is the first chapter of the book which takes place, and the only chapter of the book which takes place in the night. It involves a younger woman, Ruth, who is a descendant of Moab, of Lot and his daughter, and that incestuous relationship. And it also involves an older man, Boaz, who is a descendant of Judah, and who lies down in the night, in Ruth chapter 3, after a drink. If you've read your Bible carefully, everything about this chapter is ominous. We've seen this before. This does not end well. What demonic offspring might come out of this awful night? The chapter, once again, as the first two in Ruth, is broken pretty plainly into three sections or scenes. First we have, in the first five verses, Naomi's plan. Then we go with Ruth, in verses 6 through 14, to the threshing floor. The bulk of this chapter takes place in or at the threshing floor. And then the final scene takes place, just briefly, in verses 15 through 18, the morning after the events of the night. So let's look carefully, very carefully, unusually carefully, and see what happens in Ruth 3. Let me say up front here, especially with this chapter, you've got to be so careful, we've got to be so careful in applying these events here to our lives now. There's probably no chapter in Ruth where we more feel our distance from the culture, from the customs of ancient Bethlehem than this chapter. This is not a manual for dating or relationships at all, heavens no. And yet, if we're careful, there's so much for us to take from this remarkable night beneath the stars of Bethlehem. So let's dive in together, first looking at Naomi's plan, which is unhatched in verses 1 through 5. Some time has now passed from the end of chapter 2, where we left off last week. As chapter 3 picks up, you can see at the end of harvesting season, it's now time to thresh the grain and turn all that hard work from harvesting season, all that harvest and crop, it's time to turn it into food, it's time to turn it into profit. So Ruth and Naomi are together one evening, and just like at the beginning of the last chapter, a plan is similarly unhatched. This time, however, the plan does not come from Ruth, this time the plan comes from Naomi, the mother-in-law, who it seems has come back to life, as it were. The goal of the plan is stated outright in verse 1. Look at verse 1. Naomi, her mother-in-law, said to her, said to Ruth, my daughter, should I not rest, should I not seek rest for you, that it may be well with you? What's the purpose, what's the goal of this plan Naomi gives and reveals to her daughter-in-law? The purpose, the goal here is rest, she's seeking rest for her daughter-in-law, Ruth. You might remember, if you flip over to chapter 1, Naomi initially sent both her daughter and daughter's-in-law, Ruth and Orpah, she initially sent them after her husband died, after their husbands died, she initially sent them back to their homes, back to their people in Moab, tearfully and prayed for them. Look at chapter 1, verse 9, may the Lord grant you that you may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. It's the same word here, the rest here that Naomi is speaking of and seeking for Ruth is security. She's talking about a home, she's talking about a place to settle, but she's talking about so much more than that, she's talking about all that that signifies and represents. It could refer simply to a place to settle, but it could also mean so much more than that. Think about it, Ruth is basically homeless, childless, husbandless and hopeless, all she has is her mother-in-law, who is not getting any younger, and who cannot ultimately give her what she needs in this man's world of Israel, Naomi wants for Ruth, in other words, what every woman wants, for their daughters, for themselves, she wants for her security and a place of belonging in this world, rest. To that end, she unveils her plan, and it's an audacious plan. It all begins with a statement, very similar to the narrator's statement, which began chapter 2, look at verse 2 of chapter 3, is not Boaz our relative, with whose young women you were, remember Ruth's been gleaning in the fields of Boaz, and now Ruth introduces an idea, or Naomi rather, introduces an idea for the first time, as far as we can tell, to Ruth, is not Boaz our relative? At this point, I cannot delay any longer, I know you've been waiting, in doing my best to explain to you the somewhat complicated issue of Ruth, of Naomi, and of their prospects of a kinsman redeemer. You cannot understand the strange world of Ruth, and of Ruth chapter 3, without some basic grasp of the biblical role of a redeemer, so at long last, let's do it. Let me do my best to sketch out for you this idea, this biblical role of a redeemer. Last week I showed you how God, in kindness if you remember, had designed certain laws for the land, and for land owners, to watch out for, and to care for widows like Naomi, like Ruth. Remember, God had laws, enshrined laws, don't cut the edges of your fields, leave the leftovers effectively for widows, for strangers, for exiles, for sojourners, so that they can pick up and so that they can be cared for. That was Ruth and Naomi's only hope, and that's exactly what Ruth took advantage of in chapter 2, as she gleaned from Boaz's fields in order to eat, in order really to survive. Well in a similar way, Ruth and Naomi's actions this time in chapter 3 also rely upon ancient, very strange to us, laws, designed by God in order to care for His people, and especially in order to care for the most vulnerable among His people. So I want to briefly show you two such sets of laws, which are very similar and yet separate, which God gave to the people of Israel, conveniently, you don't have to turn there, but for your own memory, conveniently these separate sets of laws come to us from Leviticus 25, and then Deuteronomy 25, which as far as I know was not intentional, and yet it's nice for memory. The first set of laws sketched out, given by God to Israel, from Leviticus 25 we get laws teaching the role of the kinsman redeemer. Basically, when an Israelite fell upon hard times, poverty, debt, danger, maybe so impoverished that they became enslaved, they sold themselves into slavery to survive. In summary, when they could no longer care for themselves, then it was the duty at that moment of desperation, it was the duty of the nearest blood relative to act on their behalf as a redeemer. That's what a redeemer is, that's where we first learn what a redeemer is in the Bible, that concept, that role, that idea. That basic idea was actually applied to a number of different circumstances in Leviticus 25 and beyond. So, if a relative was murdered, then it was the redeemer's duty to hunt down the murderer and to avenge the death of their relative. Some of you would like that law, wouldn't you? If property was forfeited, since it could not be paid for, you lost your house, you lost your land because you couldn't pay for it, then again it was the redeemer's duty to purchase the property back and restore it to the one who lost it. If a relative became so poor and so desperate that they sold themselves into slavery, then it was the redeemer's duty to pay the ransom and set the enslaved relative free. In other words, to redeem them, that's what it means to redeem one. If a deceased relative was cheated by somebody, like in a business dealing, then the offending party, so the swindler, the cheater, was to, if this was found out, was to make restitution how? They can't pay when they cheated, they're to make restitution by paying the redeemer, their kinsman, justice. Actually pretty expansive applications there, but you get the basic idea. This is the idea and the unfolding idea and picture and portrait in the Bible, Leviticus 25, of a redeemer. A second set of laws, similar but separate, comes to us in Deuteronomy 25 and teaches us about the Leveret marriage. That's spelled like Levi, like the tribe of Levi, then R-A-T-E, Leveret, but it has nothing to do with Levi. A Leveret just means a brother-in-law. So the Leveret marriage from Deuteronomy 25, it's like the kinsman-redeemer laws, but it's more zoomed in and it plays out within the immediate family and not just the clan, as in the case of the kinsman-redeemer. This law stated that when a husband died, leaving his wife behind as a widow, and if they had not already produced a male heir who would carry on the husband's name and therefore the husband's line, then it became the brother-in-law's, the Leveret's, responsibility to marry his sister-in-law and, if possible, to produce a male heir. That son, rather, that offspring of the brother-in-law and the widow, now wife, of the brother-in-law would become, this is significant, the dead husband's legal son, carrying on his name and his line. That's actually what plays out in Genesis 38 with Judah and Tamar and Judah's sons and Tamar's. It's what was supposed to carry out, at least, before things took a really dark turn. You might actually remember Jesus in the Gospels, one of the traps that the Sadducees set for him, you remember that weird trap about, so we've got a man and a woman and they're married and then he dies and his brother comes in and marries and then he dies and they just keep going on and who will be her husband in the afterlife? Do you remember that trap? It's actually based upon this Leveret marriage law from Deuteronomy 25. Now where's the romance in all that? I admit this is all so strange, but for what it's worth, were they to look at our practices and customs of marriage today in America in 2023, I would assure you, for whatever it's worth, that they would feel exactly the same with us. I mean, you imagine sitting down with an ancient Jewish man or woman and watching The Bachelor and then actually explaining, no, no, no, yeah, they're crazy. This is good television, but that's actually how most people in our culture think about romance and love. Maybe one shorthand way of getting at the gulf between their view and ours as it relates to love is our concept of love much more revolves around connection or romance, whereas their view of love revolved much more around honor and loyalty. Also related, we think much more of individual autonomy, whereas they, as you can see in these laws, they thought much more of family solidarity. I know this is all so strange, but you have to understand in ancient Israel, family names and family lines and family inheritances, they were all signs of God's blessing. And so, therefore, the family name continuing was sort of everything. To be cut off was to be effectively cursed and cut out. These laws were a way of God, again, caring for the bereft by preserving their blessing. Now, even if we begin to grasp all those strange laws, we still have another step to go in order to understand how they work out in Ruth and really how Boaz fits into all this. In summary, Boaz fits into those two separate sets of laws mercifully. In fact, this is reflected in different ways throughout the book of Ruth. Just glance around at different phrases throughout the book. Look at over in chapter two, verse 20, you have Naomi referring for the first time to Boaz as one of our close relatives and then also as one of our redeemers. So you can already see in chapter two where Naomi's mind is headed and what she's thinking of. Then in chapter three, verse two, Naomi refers to Boaz again, but this time more generally as our relative. In chapter three, verse nine, Ruth refers to Boaz as a redeemer. Similarly, in verse 12 of chapter three, Boaz acknowledges it is true. So he knows it is true. I am a redeemer. I want you to see, though, it's really the A there is really important. I am a redeemer. He is one of our redeemers. He is a redeemer, not the redeemer. The language conveys, in other words, mere possibility and not reality necessarily, certainly not requirement for Boaz. My point is to show you the ambiguity really of Boaz's status with respect to Ruth and Naomi and any potential role he might play of redeemer in their lives. Boaz was not a brother of Naomi's late husband, Elimelech. Strictly speaking, he is under no obligation whatsoever to marry Naomi or Ruth or even to care for them in any way. He's a relative, but he's also not even immediate family. I compared him last week. He's like the family member who shares your last name, who you see at the family reunion, who you maybe recognize after a few years. As the book of Ruth progresses, it becomes clearer and clearer that, first of all, the deleverate law does not apply to him at all, but also that the kinsmen redeemer laws do not necessarily apply to him either, again, strictly speaking. In other words, he's free if he wants to be. If you remember last week before heading out into the fields of Boaz to glean, Ruth basically told Naomi her plan was she was searching for favor. She was hoping that somebody would give her favor. It's the same word in the Bible used for grace. Her entire plan hinged upon grace. What a plan. I think we could say fairly that as she makes her way in this chapter to Boaz, once again, her plan entirely depends upon favor, upon grace. It hinges entirely not upon anything required, much less deserved. She has no rights here. Neither one of them do. It all hinges, once again, upon grace. Now bearing all that in mind, in verse 3, notice, Naomi instructs Ruth to take a bath. Never a bad idea. To anoint herself. That probably means to put on perfume. To get dressed up. Now Ruth has likely, according to the customs of the day, been wearing the garments of a mourning widow, which would signal to everybody, number one, in a way this is a charity case, but certainly this is not anyone available. Naomi is effectively telling her, put on a dress. Change what you're signaling from mourning to available. She tells her to put on a dress, and when she gets there in verse 4, Naomi instructs her to wait patiently until Boaz is finished. At the threshing floor, with his meal and his drink, even more, until he has lied down for sleep, once he's snoring, Naomi tells Ruth, make your move. Dash to where he lies, uncover his feet, lie down there, and then wait to see what he says. What an absurd, audacious, dangerous, foolish. I'm running out of synonyms to use here. What a ridiculous plan. And yet Ruth, ever the loyal servant to Naomi, verse 5, she replies, all that you say, I will do. That's the plan, and that brings us, secondly, to the threshing floor. So look at verse 6, and we'll transition scenes here to the threshing floor. Verse 6, so she went down, Ruth did, to the threshing floor, and just as her mother-in-law had commanded her. So Boaz ran a field, remember, he's in charge, he's a landowner, right outside of the town of Bethlehem, there would have been a plot of fields and sectioned off, and Boaz owned and operated one of those fields, and owning a field, Boaz would also have owned another separate property related to that field. So Boaz runs the field where he and his people worked all harvest season long for grain, but harvest season is now over, it's now time for threshing. So somewhere, perhaps nearby, but also outside of the city, and importantly, outside of the city lights, this is ancient Israel, way outside of the city, so when we're under the cover of darkness here, this is darker than dark, this is as dark as it gets, which helps to explain some of the weird events and unfolding happenings of chapter 3, but somewhere out in the dark was a place that Boaz, and like every other farmer, would have also operated called the threshing floor. This would have been a large open space outdoors, with a hard surface ground below it, which was critical, where all the good part of the wheat, the grain, could be separated from all the rest of the wheat that you didn't need. So they had tools, tools which were pulled by men, some which were pulled by oxen, to trample out the grain on that hard ground. There were winnowing forks, used to toss the sheaves up into the air, so that the chaff was, the light chaff was blown away by the wind, and the heavier grain would then fall to the ground, where you could then pick it up. It was critical to find a spot out in the open air, so that the breeze would blow more regularly, more strongly, when was your friend in this business? It was also normal to do this work at nighttime for the same reason, because there was more, there was more wind circulating. It was hard work, it was grueling work. So just think about it, Boaz is out here working and sleeping at the threshing floor. He might be an older man, but he's not a feeble man. Threshing floors in this culture were also hubs for social gatherings and sites for parties, celebrations for a successful harvest, feasts and wine, you can see here in this chapter. It makes perfect sense. This was, this moment, this place was the end, really the reward for a full season's hard work. They also, more darkly, in ancient history developed a reputation for illicit activity. Working men, think about it, are separated for a series of nights from their wives, from their families, and in the darkness of the night, when the wine was flowing, threshing floors were frequented by prostitutes, looking for a bit of easy money from a bunch of vulnerable, often drunk men. So these really were, you could say, an ancient Near Eastern sort of red light district. You can actually see the Bible making reference to this in the words of judgment recorded by the prophet Hosea. Listen to what God says to Hosea, to his people in Hosea, rejoice not, O Israel, exult not like the peoples, for you have played the harlot, forsaking your God. You have loved a prostitute's wages on all threshing floors. As Hosea 9, 1 gives you an indication of the reputation for threshing floors and prostitution during the time of Ruth. This nighttime mission Naomi sends Ruth on, a young woman, a foreigner at that, dressed up in the darkness of the night at the threshing floor when the wine was flowing in the days of judges. Do you remember the days of judges? This is a dangerous plan to say the least. What in the world was Naomi thinking? I actually read experts this week, some of whom argued that this was the turning point, this plan of Naomi in Ruth chapter 3, verses 1 through 5, is Naomi finally coming to her senses and acting in accord with faith. I also read other experts who said this is Naomi yet again playing the part of a fool, just like at the beginning of the book of Ruth, where she flees the promised land for the fields of Moab in famine and does not trust God. Nobody knows what to do with Naomi here and how to make sense of her insane plans for her daughter-in-law. This was, nobody again would send their daughter for this. The only clue that the narrator gives as to what Naomi was thinking and how she possibly thought this was an okay idea, the only clue was back in verse 5, when she told Ruth what to do and when her entire plan culminated under the covers at the feet of Boaz with the mysterious comment from Naomi, and then he will tell you what to do. In other words, the success and the safety of this entire plan is seemingly dependent upon Boaz, entirely dependent upon Boaz. And maybe as we've been watching and studying the character of Boaz in this book, maybe that is everything. Off Ruth goes in verse 6, under the cover of darkness, and this is where things get steamy or weird or just something, verse 7, and when Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then she, Ruth, came softly and uncovered his feet and lay down. So many landmines here that I've got to just dance across without causing any of them to explode in our midst with children in the room. Is Boaz the worthy man drunk here? What exactly is Ruth saying here? And even more, do I even want to know what she's doing? And the feet, do I even want to know about the feet? What's going on with the feet here? Let's take a careful look at each in turn. Boaz is full of food and drink and we read that his heart was merry. That phrase, his heart was merry, is used often in the Bible to refer to a general state of contentment, of satisfaction, of rest, sometimes after a meal, sometimes after a drink, sometimes just because, for no apparent reason, just having a good day. Aren't those the best kinds of days? At any rate, that's Boaz in this moment. He's finished a hard day, a hard night, as well as work. He's had a full meal and he's had a glass of wine. And now he lays down for the happiest sleep of the year, harvest sleep. And he lays down notice at the end of the heap of grain. They slept outside in the night on the threshing floor by the grain, why? To protect it. This is all their work. This is not the picture of a passed out drunk man. He's on guard really, even as he sleeps. And in tiptoes, as he falls asleep, fully satisfied, fully content, sleeping so well, in tiptoes, Ruth. Can't you just hear her tiptoeing in? No, you can't hear her at all. For she seeks in like a cat in the night, snooping around everybody else in the threshing floor, making her way, dashing and darting her way to Boaz. And there arriving at Boaz, she uncovers his feet and she lies down. Strangest part of the strangest chapter in the somewhat strange book of Ruth. Let me make it even stranger. Feet here can also be translated, is often translated in the Bible as legs, uh-oh. So it's not hard to imagine how this could be used, this phrase could be used euphemistically. At other times in the Bible, similar language is used as innuendo. Uncovering here, she uncovers his feet. That's even more suggestive. You, you just have to remember Genesis to know what I'm talking about. Noah's son, Ham, do you remember that scene? Noah's passed out, drunk from his vineyard, which he planted, Genesis nine, Ham walks in on him and uncovers, we read, his nakedness and was cursed for it. To be uncovered in the Bible sometimes means to be exposed, to be ashamed, even to be defiled. So what in the world is going on here with Ruth and Boaz? Let's keep reading. Look at verse eight, at midnight, the man, Boaz, was startled and turned over and behold, a woman lay at his feet. He said, who are you? I love this. Boaz, up to this point of the story, is like a man out of a magazine, perfectly Photoshopped without any flaw or blemish. I mean, I made a joke this week to some friends. Are we sure Boaz is not Melchizedek? It was a joke. My point is kind of the same. Who is this Boaz guy? Like Melchizedek. Where did he come from? He seems perfect. No father, no mother, no genealogy. Is this another Melchizedek? He's not, but you get the point. He comes off so flawlessly. So how did this guy exist in Bethlehem in the days of the judges? He's perfect until now. Here he is having a nice snore, all of a sudden feeling a rush of cold wind on his now uncovered toes. Here he is, startling awake, confused, afraid. Remember it's pitch black outside and just blurting out, who are you? Who's there? You're supposed to laugh. He's not the Marlboro man after all. And she answered, I am Ruth, Ruth, that remarkable Moabite girl who'd been gleaning in his fields the talk of the town after she'd come back to Israel from Moab to serve her mother-in-law at great cost to herself. What must have raced through Boaz's mind when he heard that familiar voice and heard that name? Had he been dreaming in that moment? And was he awakened to find his dream now a reality? And she answered, I am Ruth, your servant, spread your wings over your servant, for you are a redeemer. This is probably the most exalted and pregnant language in all of Ruth. This is very exalted, very pregnant language for anywhere in the Bible. Remember last chapter, Boaz, upon meeting Ruth, having heard of all that she'd done for Naomi, he prays for her. And look at verse 12 of chapter two, how he prays. He prays, may the Lord repay you for what you have done and a full reward be given you by the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge. Ruth takes his words from the chapter before, and here she echoes them back to him. Spread your wings, your wings over me, Boaz. She says to Boaz, really, Boaz, become the answer to your prayer for me. In Genesis nine, after Ham uncovered Noah's nakedness, his other two sons, Shem and Japheth, walked hearing what their brother had done. They walked into Noah's, their father's tent, backwards with a garment in their hands and without looking at their father and thus defiling their father, they covered him and covered his shame. They honored and they protected their father. They really undid Ham's wicked deed. In Ezekiel, God speaks a word to the prophet Ezekiel about Israel, who at this point it's clear has repeatedly betrayed him. She has acted like a harlot again and again. Listen to the word that God speaks to his harloting bride, Israel, the people of God in Ezekiel 16 verse eight. Listen to this. God says, when I passed by you again and saw you, behold, you were at the age for love and I spread the corner of my garment over you and covered your nakedness. I made my vow to you and entered into a covenant with you, declares the Lord God, and you became mine. God comes to his unfaithful, repeatedly unfaithful bride, Israel, covers her up with his garment and it's the image here, I hope you see, of a marriage covenant. What is Ruth saying here? What is she doing? This is a marriage proposal. Ruth is calling Boaz to honor her, protect her, marry her, and become her and Naomi's redeemer. She proposes to him. I think the key to understanding this really strange and really ambiguous passage, and let me just say here, I imagine some of you are in here, maybe you got a little bit of a cynical bend and you're thinking like, okay, is the meaning in this passage actually somewhat clear and a conservative guy, preacher like me, doesn't, he just can't accept that Ruth would do that or Boaz could really say that? And so you're just sort of doing gymnastics and hula hoops and everything you do to work your way around what the text is obviously saying. Let me assure you, for whatever it's worth, nothing about what happens, these words, this language, these scenes here is at all clear. It all seems very intentionally ambiguous. I'm not trying to hide something from you to keep you from a reality that I just cannot accept that happened here. I think the key to understanding this passage and this really ambiguous language here is actually a few other scenes in the Bible which describe very similarly racy situations. Genesis 19, Lot and his daughters, a drunken night, a younger woman with an older man, an awful dark night. Genesis 38, Judah and Tamar, more drink, a young widow, another older man, another awful dark chapter. I could even mention, as I did a few weeks ago, Judges 19, perhaps the darkest episode in all of the Bible. I'm not going to rehash it all now, but suffice it to say it begins with a man in the night and his heart becoming merry before another tragic, awful ending. Ruth is a Moabite woman, younger woman from Moab. Judas is an older man from Judah. There's darkness, there's drink. You have to see, could the stage possibly be more set here for something similar to all those awful scenes we've seen before? Something awful. All this ambiguous language, the entire scene seems designed to raise your eyebrow and really maybe your blood pressure that something similar is about to go down here. Something dark, something close your eyes, don't look awful is about to unfold, but none of that ever really happens. Actually, through this remarkable scenes of the night, what happens? Kind of nothing happens. It's like this epic, epic, massive, ominous buildup and then a bunch of pillow talk and sleep. Everything that happens here is honorable, even I would say beautiful. Even if you don't fully understand all the details, it's clear that everything is meant to be portrayed here as honorable. I wonder, in other words, if you're catching my drift, I wonder if this is an intentional reversal of Genesis 19 and of the sins of Lot and his daughters producing Moab. Maybe even, in a way, a little reversal of the dark days of the judges. Maybe just a ray of hope breaking in and breaking through an awful cycle of sin and darkness as in those days, a vulnerable, endangered woman comes to a man who has all the power. He's wealthy. She's poor. He's old. She's young. He's an insider Israelite. She's an outsider. It's in the night on his turf, in the threshing floor. She's in every way vulnerable here. He has all the power. When she comes to him, endangered, vulnerable, only she finds a worthy man, an honorable man who treats her like she belongs to somebody else, who behaves himself like he belongs to somebody else, like even his own desires are not his own but belong to God. Sometimes all it takes is one man, one woman, one couple to alter the course of a family headed straight for destruction, maybe even sometimes to alter the course of a nation chosen by God and yet living in ruin. As he's startled awake, Ruth proposes to him and in verse 10 he said, may you be blessed by the Lord, my daughter. You have made this last kindness greater than the first in that you have not gone after young men, whether poor or rich. Boaz responds by blessing her, by invoking the name of God. There's nothing sensual about his words or actions here at all. He speaks as a man indifferent to his own passions. He speaks as a man really in the presence of God. The chapter ends with an agreement, sort of. Maybe you've had friends who, a fellow, a brother, a friend who went to propose and he comes back, I proposed, I asked her to marry me and what do you say? What'd she say? And he said, well she said yeah. She basically said yeah. Basically? This is a proposal, sort of. Look at verse 11, and now my daughter, do not fear, I will do for you all that you ask. For all my fellow townsmen know that you are a worthy woman, but there's a wrench. Verse 12, and now it is true that I am a redeemer, and yet there is a redeemer nearer than I. Remain tonight and in the morning, if he will redeem you, good, let him do it. But if he is not willing to redeem you, then as the Lord lives, I will redeem you. Lie down until the morning, and so she laid his feet until the morning, but arose before one could recognize another, and he said, let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor. Now we learn for the first time here in this moment that Naomi has another relative in Bethlehem besides Boaz, in fact closer to her, to her family than Boaz. And therefore, still under, even this relative, this closer relative, still under no obligation at all for Ruth, for Naomi, and yet more qualified than Boaz is to act as a redeemer. Boaz tells her to stay until the morning. He protects her. Don't leave in the night. He's protecting her. He also protects her reputation. He sends her away before it's fully light, before anybody can recognize her. Why? Because he doesn't want anyone knowing a woman was at the threshing floor. Because why? Because they might get the wrong idea. Remember what I said earlier about threshing floors and their reputation in this day? It's not Boaz's threshing floor. Illicit women were not known or allowed or whispered about. This is truly an honorable, worthy man as we saw last week. I wonder if they slept that night at all, or just lay silently, both minds bursting with ideas, both hearts bursting with hope. At any rate, the next morning comes, and so we'll finish here just briefly. The final scene, verses 15 through 18, the morning after, the final scene takes place the next day in the morning. Ruth makes it back to the city. She makes it back once again to Naomi, just like at the end of chapter two. Once again, she's filled with food, this time even more than last time. This time, if you do the math, it's probably somewhere between 60 to 100 pounds of barley. I just want you to see one final thing from this final scene before I conclude. Verse 17, look at verse 17. Ruth explains her arrival and all the further barley. In verse 17, here's her explanation. These six measures of barley Boaz gave to me, for he said to me, you must not go back empty-handed to your mother-in-law. I want you to see that Boaz concluded the strange night by joining Ruth in caring for Naomi, and I want you to especially see that word, empty-handed. Back in chapter one, you might remember, Naomi renamed herself. Naomi means pleasant or sweetie. She renamed herself Mara, which means bitter because, why? Because she said, after losing her husband, after losing her two sons, she says, I went away full, but the Lord has brought me back empty. And so she became a bitter woman, bitter at the Lord, because she understood that God had emptied her of everything she loved. Here at the conclusion of chapter three, Boaz sends Ruth with grain back to Naomi, and also with these words, you must not, Ruth basically quotes, paraphrases, he said to me, you must not return empty-handed to Naomi. It's the same word from chapter one, only here, it's not empty. God is filling and really refilling Naomi's cup in ways that Naomi was not prepared to imagine, and he's filling her through that remarkable, what do you know? That remarkable Moabite daughter-in-law of hers, and the worthy man who she's happened upon his fills. Chapter three ends with the strongest signal of hope yet in the book of Ruth. It's Christmas Eve in Bethlehem. The night is pregnant with hope. Tomorrow, chapter four, a child will be born. Now I'm sure if you've heard a sermon series on the book of Ruth, then your preacher probably made connections between Boaz and Jesus. Yeah, Boaz, our kinsman redeemer, Jesus, our greater redeemer. How could your preacher not go for that connection? I can't wait to have a lot of fun with that next week. It's gonna be Christmas Eve. Are y'all not so excited to redeem her on Christmas Eve? Let's go. But I want you to see something more this week, maybe a bit more surprising. I wanna leave you this week with a final look at another character in the story who cast a surprising shadow for Jesus and the work that Jesus will accomplish for his people. I want you to take one final look at Ruth. In verse 10, look at verse 10 again, Boaz blesses Ruth for this last kindness. The word there is the word we've met again and again through the book. It's a key word in the book. It's hesed. It means it's the strongest form of covenant love, of loving kindness, of steadfast love, of loyalty, loyal love, we could translate it. Loving loyalty. Boaz blesses Ruth for this last kindness, which he then says was greater than the first. In verse 11, he calls Ruth a worthy woman. You remember in chapter two, Boaz we met was called a worthy man. You might remember I signaled at the beginning of Ruth chapter one that Ruth in the Hebrew Bible comes right on the hills of Proverbs 31, where we meet the worthy woman. Same exact phrase. The worthy woman in Proverbs chapter 31, you turn the page in the Hebrew Bible and you open up to the book of Ruth, who we meet in time to be revealed as the worthy woman. Now think about this. What kindness is Boaz referring to? You cannot miss this. What was the first kindness he was referring to? He says this last kindness is greater than even the first. What was the first kindness? The first kindness the book makes explicit. It was Ruth refusing to leave Naomi's side in chapter one and choosing to abandon her home, her people, her God, to leave all that behind to stick together with Naomi, which Boaz had heard of. He'd heard the rumors about it. And so he praised her when he finally met her for this remarkable kindness. You can see this in Boaz's words in chapter two, verse 11. The second kindness, this even greater kindness is Ruth choosing Boaz and asking him to marry her. But you have to understand why this is so great and what exactly Boaz is praising her for. Boaz is not simply rejoicing. Perhaps you assume reading it, hearing it. Perhaps you assume he's just rejoicing because he got the girl. You're so kind. I listened to a concert last night at the end, and this guy at the end, a singer I really like in a band, it was the end of a big concert, and he says, you have no idea how much we love you. We love you. He said it to a faceless crowd of like tens and tens of thousands of people. And I always get so cynical in those moments because I'm like, you don't even know these people. What you're saying when you say you have no idea how much I love you is I love how much you love me. And you come out and praise and sing for me. You can read Boaz like that sort of, couldn't you? Like you're so kind because you showed it to me. I don't think that's what Boaz is saying at all here. What makes Ruth's choice of Boaz so remarkable in such a remarkable instance of further chesed kindness is why she chose Boaz. Why did Ruth choose Boaz? This is what you cannot miss. She did not choose him for his money. She did not choose him for his age. She did not choose him for his look. She did not choose him for his power. She did not choose him for his security. She chose him. Why? One reason. She chose him. Why? For Naomi. She chose him because he was a relative of Naomi's. And thus, especially as a worthy man, could be a redeemer for Naomi. You have to see this if you want to grasp this remarkable little story, which is the book of Ruth. One of the most remarkable stories ever told in the history of the world. One of the most surprising, maybe most misunderstood things about the book of Ruth is it is not primarily a story about the love, a love story between Ruth and Boaz. That's real. That's there. But it's very much in the background of the narrator's story. We're reading something into it that's not there if we make this just a two lovebirds older, younger, whatever. But they got together. The book of Ruth is a story primarily about the love, about the chesed between Ruth and Naomi. Everything Ruth does in the entire book is out of loyalty to Naomi. Do you see that? Ruth left her home in Moab and everything she knew for Naomi. She joined Naomi in her emptiness. She did not have to be Ruth. Ruth was young enough to get married again, to have babies, to go back to her family and her money. She left all of that in order to join Naomi in her emptiness. She became empty with Naomi. This kindness and everything else she did, she did it all for Naomi. She did it all in loyalty to her and for her good. In the end, her loving loyalty, Ruth's for Naomi, her chesed is what God used to restore Naomi. God through Ruth filled Naomi's empty cup. The Lord Jesus is an ancient ancestor of Ruth, born in the little town of Bethlehem. He left his heavenly home where he eternally dwelled in glory, where angels bowed down before him. He left it all for the dirt and death of this earth. He emptied himself, Paul writes in Philippians. He emptied himself, becoming as a man, even as a debased man, eventually entering to the point of death, the death we all deserve for our sins on a cross. Only then, only after tasting the full darkness our sins deserve, only then did his story change, did his tragedy turn to triumph as God rose him from the dead. All this he did, the Lord Jesus, out of his loving kindness, out of his covenant loyalty, has said for his father. He never wavered once his entire life in his not my will, but yours be done, has said. The same loving loyalty has been offered to you in salvation and extended to all who will empty themselves of whatever they're hoping in, whatever they're trusting in, to be filled by him and by his righteousness. For them, he will never leave you nor forsake you. He will hold you fast until the very end. He'll bear you up on eagle's wings. He's with you today. He'll be with you tomorrow. He'll be with you for today's laughter and for tomorrow's tears. He's with you in the darkness and in the danger of the night, in the hope of the morning. He's still there. He will never leave. Even in death, when we enter into the grave, Jesus will meet us there. He's with us. This is not a dating manual, my goodness. It's a story about the power of love, breaking into our broken world from the most surprising spaces, mending what's broken and filling what's empty, has said. Let me pray. God, thank you for your loving loyalty to your father, which has been overflowed to your loving loyalty to us. God, we pray that we would receive it, your kindness, your love, your loyalty by faith in Christ. And God, we pray we would then mimic it as we loyally love and stand by others. We pray these things in Jesus' name.
