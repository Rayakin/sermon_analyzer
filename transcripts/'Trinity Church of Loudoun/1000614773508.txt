If you have a Bible, you can go ahead and turn to Genesis chapter 23, if you're new with us this morning or new to the Bible. We do have a Bible for you if you don't own a copy of God's Word. We have lots of Bibles through those double doors, and you are free to grab one and use it this morning. If you don't own one, take it home as our gift to you. But we're in Genesis 23 this morning. 20 miles south of Israel, on the West Bank and in the ancient city of Hebron, stands the Ibrahimi Mosque. Throughout history, this site has flipped back and forth between a mosque and a synagogue. And actually today, and for quite some time now, it doubles. Part of the property stands today as a mosque, and part of it stands as a small synagogue. Because today, ownership of this property is split between and shared between an Islamic trust and Israeli military. The site has been the source and center of frequent conflict and attack for more than a thousand years now. In 1994, an Israeli extremist opened fire on Muslims praying in the mosque for Ramadan. Killing 29, injuring 125. That's just the latest significant conflict on these grounds. It is the fourth holiest site of Islam, and the second most holy site of Jewish tradition, only ranking after Temple Mount and the site of Solomon's Temple. All the controversy and all the conflict is rooted in the sacred origins of this site. Because beneath the mosque and beneath the synagogue, in the ground is a cave. Believed to be the cave of Machpelah, also known as the cave of the patriarchs. It is believed to be the ancient burial site of Abraham, of Isaac, and of all the patriarchs. This morning we learn of its origin and of its significance in Genesis chapter 23 as Abraham, Father Abraham purchases this site in order to bury his beloved wife, Sarah. So let's dive in. There are three things I want you to observe and we'll observe together as we walk through this passage. A death, a grave, and a funeral. A death, a grave, and a funeral. And the main thing I want you to see from this passage, the main argument I want to make, which I think is true to Moses' argument as the author of Genesis, and which still applies to you and I today as followers of Jesus, is this, even in death God is securing a home for his people. Even in death God is securing a home for his people. So first let's observe together a death. For more than 60 years now we've journeyed alongside Abraham. He's laughed, he's trembled in fear, he's killed, he's feasted. We've watched the man eat many times. He's worshiped, he's set up altars to worship. He's believed. But now, 60 years onward, for the first time in the journey, as far as we're aware, as far as Moses tells us, for the first time Abraham cries. He didn't cry when he left home and family to follow God's call to a foreign land in Genesis chapter 12. He didn't cry when Sodom was destroyed and all the peoples who he'd earlier saved in Genesis 14 went up in smoke with the city. He didn't even cry as anguished as he was when he sent away Hagar and his firstborn son Ishmael, never to see them again. But he mourns now, for the first time, at the death of his lifelong companion and beloved wife, his partner in the journey of following God by faith, his soul's mate, his princess as God named her, Sarah. Genesis 23 verse one says this. Look at your Bible. Sarah lived 127 years. These were the years of the life of Sarah. And Sarah died at Kiriath Arba, that is Hebron, in the land of Canaan. And Abraham went in to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her. Here we learn something that all of us know and perhaps all of us take for granted. Death comes to all and that means death comes to God's loved ones too. Even if you're here this morning and a believer in Christ, death comes to all, even God's loved ones too. I wonder if you noticed as we read the passages, as it was read for us just a few moments ago, I wonder if you noticed in the passage the repetition of death and the burying of the dead. Look back at your Bibles. Let me just show you really quickly. Verse two, we read, and Sarah died. So verse two, the beginning of the chapter, we got it. She's dead. There's no more suspense. Her life is over. She's dead. But then verse three says, and Abraham rose up from before his dead. And verse six says, bury your dead. And then again, verse six says, burying your dead. And then verse eight says, if you are willing that I should bury my dead out of my sight. And then verse 11 says, bury your dead. And then verse 13 says that I may bury my dead here. And finally, verse 15 says, one last time, bury your dead. Nine times in one chapter, Moses references the dead and the burial of the dead. You know what this reminds me of? What does it remind you of? Anything else we've seen so far in Genesis? It reminds me of the genealogy of Genesis chapter five. Do you remember that? And the so-called genealogy of death, where we read again and again and again as the constant refrain in the chapter, and he died, such and such was born, son of such and such, and lived X years, and he died, and he died, and he died, and he died. It's a whole chorus of death. As the author Moses, by this genealogy, is making the point that death is now ruling and reigning and overtaking humanity. And so it is here. Moses strikes the same chorus once again. Sarah was God's covenant partner along with her husband Abraham, but the curse of death still got to her too. Don't miss this. Death truly comes to all, even God's loved ones. Even if you're a believer here this morning, even though all the promises of God find their yes and amen for you in Christ, even still, unless Jesus returns first, you and I must face the curse of death right along with the rest of humanity. We all must face it. But there's a new note in this symphony this morning, which is different from Genesis chapter five, is I'm gonna show you as we move on through this passage, that the death chord is being struck and strummed once again, and he died, and buried the dead, and the dead, and the dead, and the dead. But this time it's being struck. I want you to notice, I wanna show you, it's being struck as a chord of hope. Moses' chapter here covering Sarah's death, if you pay attention carefully, it's not actually about Sarah's death at all. I wonder if you noticed that as you read this this week, or as it was just read for us just moments ago. The chapter's actually not about her death, or even primarily at least about her funeral at all. It's about something else, something beyond Sarah, something even beyond Abraham. And so it is by the power of the gospel, in your and my death, if we are safe in Christ, there is something more than death, something beyond death, and even funerals are more than an ending. They are an ending, but they're also a new beginning. And we see that in this morning, Abraham seems to know this, even as he buries his wife, which explains why he behaves the strange way that he does. And so secondly, I want to show you, I want us to observe together a grave in Abraham's busy, extravagant, extensive work here to negotiate in verses three through 18, a grave to bury his wife in. There are two problems that arrive in this story, and I wonder if you felt them both as we're reading this passage. You need to feel both of these problems. One is more immediate and minor. The other is more long-term and ultimate and larger. The first more immediate problem is the obvious. Abraham has no land, has no place to bury his wife, Sarah, who's now dead. Remember, they're strangers, they're foreigners, they're sojourners in a land. So he doesn't own it. He's welcomed here. He's blessed here. He has a big chunk of land, but he doesn't own it. And so he has nowhere to bury his wife. That's the more immediate problem. But the second bigger, more ultimate problem is this. God's covenant partners, his people, his new family, they're now dying, and they still haven't received the promises. A significant, remember, a significant part of God's promise to Abraham was for land, the so-called promised land. Remember the big three promises God struck to Abraham and Sarah and all those following him, beginning back in Genesis 12 and then repeated again and again and again. What was it? Anybody in here? We don't have the college students with us, so you guys are gonna have to help us out. What are the three big promises? Oh my gosh, we don't need the college students. They can stay home all summer. People, place, and blessing. Three big promises given by God to Abraham in covenant, sealed in covenant. People, place, and blessing. Remember, the middle part of that is place, a land. In fact, all the land that Abraham is sojourning in, the land of Canaan, God has invited Abraham up to the mountain, told him to look out as far as he can see, east, west, north, south. It's all promised to him, and yet now Sarah has died, and they're still sojourners, and they have no land to their name. In verse four, look at verse four. Abraham says, give me property. Do you see that in verse four? Now watch this. Verse four, give me property. The word there, just file this away, the word there is ahuza. It's a weird word, but a fun word. Kids, if you wanna say it together, let's go, ahuza. Kids? Oh, this is my fault. That was terrible choir conducting. Kids, let's say ahuza on three. One, two, three, ahuza. Abraham, verse four says, give me property. Give me ahuza. Now back in 17, verse eight, you don't have to turn there, but back in Genesis 17, verse eight, God had promised to give Abraham all the land of Canaan as his, quote, everlasting possession. You know what the word there possession is? I bet the kids know it. Ahuza. So get this. God has promised to give to Abraham all this land of Canaan as an everlasting possession, ahuza. Here, as Sarah, his wife, dies, Abraham is negotiating and crying out as it were, give me ahuza. Why? Because he still has no property. You see? You see the real problem here? His wife is dying. He knows he's next. He's older than she, he's a decade ahead of her. He knows he's next. He's got the child, still has no nation though, but he's got no land. So what about God's promises? This is the problem of this chapter, and indeed, this is part of the life of faith for every Christian. We inherit promises. The Bible is chock full of wonderful eternal promises for everyone who trusts in Jesus. All of them are ours in Jesus, but we must suffer and die. Before receiving most of, honestly, our reward. And so we must believe and wait. We don't just feast here and relax and inherit all now. We sing that song. I love that song. We will feast in the house of Zion, but we can't sing quite yet exactly. We are feasting, and the syllables will be too many for that chorus, but also that's not exactly true yet. We're not yet fully feasting in the house of Zion. We will someday, but we die waiting. We all suffer and we die, and we die still waiting like Sarah, and soon to be like Abraham. Now, if you've ever experienced the loss of a loved one, you'll know that one of the most difficult parts of the process, which is really sad, but it can be the funeral arrangements. So you lose a spouse or a mom or a dad or a grandparent or God forbid, a child, and it's tragic. But a lot of times you don't even fully have time to mourn because in the wake of death, you have to tend to their will and mess with and arrange their belongings. And you have to arrange a funeral and you have to deal with money and you have to pay for the funeral, and you have to pay for the funeral, and the coffin, which is not cheap. And you have to, oftentimes, if you're the primary loved one dealing with all these arrangements, you have to deal with family and travel. And you're pulling all these things together, which is why often it's only after the funeral that a mother, a daughter, a son really breaks down and is able to mourn. It's sad, but it's necessary. Abraham here in verse two does take the time to mourn and weep. But I want you to see the bulk of this chapter is Abraham in the wake of his wife's death, hastily making just such arrangements for her funeral. It's a mad rush in verses three through 18 of business, of negotiations, of money changing hands, of deals being struck. Only, catch this, his interests are different from ours. You see, he's not only or simply securing a proper funeral for his beloved. He is securing a stake in the promised land. And not just for him, but for all future generations who come from him. He's negotiating ahuza, possession, property, ownership, look at verse three. In Abraham, we read, rose up from before his dead and he said to the Hittites, I am a sojourner and a foreigner among you. Give me property, give me ahuza among you for a burying place that I may bury my dead out of my sight. Now remember, again, Abraham lives as a stranger in a foreign land, which has been promised to him, but he still has no stake in it. He's a renter. He owns no property, he's not a citizen of the land. So think of his options. He can go back to Ur of the Chaldeans where he's from and where his brothers are buried. He can go back there, but he doesn't, why? Because he's a man of faith and he believes these wild promises of God. And so he rather goes to work and gathers an audience with the Hittites in order to make negotiations. The Hittites, by the way, were the main inhabitants of the promised land of Canaan at this time. The land, again, that has been promised to Abraham. And so the negotiations begin. Look at verse five. The Hittites answered Abraham, hear us, my Lord, you are a prince of God among us. Bury your dead in the choices of our tombs. None of us will withhold from you his tomb to hinder you from burying your dead. So the negotiations begin and they start off on a really promising note. Abraham, it's very clear, has favor here with the Hittite people, the people of the land, which shouldn't really surprise us. Number one, Abraham was rich. And a lot of times the wealthy have favor with those around them and among them. But number two, Abraham has been a good neighbor to them for a long time, including rescuing many of them from foreign kings in Genesis chapter 14. So it's not shocking that Abraham has the favor that he does given his stature and his history in this land. He might not be a citizen, but he's a good neighbor and he's defeated foreign armies to protect them. But I want you to see their favor is mixed. And even their words here probably include a bit of flattery. They see in Abraham a potential ally, but also really deep pockets to exploit. And yet, however calculated they are and shrewd too, as I'm gonna show you, Abraham is even more so. They have goodwill towards Abraham, but they want his money. He has goodwill too, but he wants that land. And more specifically, he wants, he doesn't just want a burial, he wants ownership of this land. And so notice they immediately offer him land. Take any tomb you want, they say. Abraham names a specific piece of land, a piece of property he wants. He's been evidently eyeballing for some time the cave of Machpelah. And so he calls out of the crowd, this crowd of Hittites in verse eight, he calls out Ephron, the son of Zohar, who owns the land with that cave. And Abraham asks Ephron to buy it at full price. Ephron says, verse 11, buy it. It's yours, Abraham. I'll give it to you and you can bury your dead there. Now that sounds like an amazing deal, doesn't it? That sounds like the sort of God deal that Christians always talk about. And I wanted to buy this thing, but they just called me and told me that God said to give it to me. And I just gave him all the praise and I took it, right? That's what this feels like with Abraham. And yet he doesn't take it. Why doesn't he take this deal, you should be asking. Abraham bows down, look at verse 12. And then in verse 13, he insists once again on paying full price. Ephron, and this is where I think we see his game and exactly what he was playing at and his shrewdness. Ephron in verse 15 says, my Lord, this piece of land is worth 400 shekels, but that's nothing between you and me. Bury your dead here. Just take it, he says. Do you see the shrewdness here? He names the price. Why, if you really mean just take it, it's yours, why name a price in the first place? Furthermore, we don't know about shekels, but this is an insane price. This is a highly exorbitant price. Joseph, the human being is bought later in Genesis for 20 shekels. David in 2 Samuel purchases the plot of land upon which will go the temple for 50 shekels. 400 shekels, this is a scam. This is like buying a house in Loudoun County. And yet, even more remarkably, Abraham does it. No questions, no haggling. Ephron surely expected him to haggle. No, he doesn't. He takes out the silver right here on the spot. He weighs it out in front of all these witnesses, verse 16, and he strikes the deal. Now, why did he just do that? Abraham's no sucker. He's a lot of things, but he's not a sucker. We know that from our journeys with Abraham. Why did he do that? Look at verse 17. So the field of Ephron in Machpelah, which was to the east of Mamre, the field with the cave that was in it and all the trees that were in the field, throughout its whole area, it was made over to Abraham as a possession in the presence of the Hittites before all who went into the gate of the city. The word in verse 18, where we read that this field, this land, this cave was given to Abraham as a possession. You know what the word is? Ahuza. Abraham just got a stake in the promised land. Abraham just gained property, possession. Abraham just struck a deal to secure another one of these promises of God. Do you see why Abraham made this deal as he did? And he did it even better before all these witnesses in a way that nobody could deny. The cave of Machpelah would become, would become, as we read, the graveyard for Sarah. Shortly after that, Abraham would join her there himself in burial, will be there in a couple of weeks. Later in Genesis, Isaac, Rebekah, Leah, and Jacob would be buried in the same cave of Machpelah. In the very last verses, and I mean the very last verses of Genesis, Joseph is about to die. And you remember Joseph is living afar, abroad as a ruler in Egypt because his brothers sold him. And on his dying bed and as his dying request, Genesis 50 verses 24 and 25, Joseph, ruler Joseph asks his brothers to carry his coffin up from Egypt. Why? So that they could bury his bones with his fathers in the cave of Machpelah. Abraham now has a stake in the promised land. It's not much, but it's something. It's a graveyard, in fact. And yet it's just one small piece of land. Remember, all of it's been promised him as far as he can see, north, south, east, west, all of Canaan is his. All of these Hittites, they don't know it, but they're actually the renters as God has promised it. And here Abraham receives just a little piece and that's it. In fact, it'd be 400 more years until, 400 years total until God's people received all of the promised land of Canaan. 400 years. Think about that. Abraham and Sarah waited 25 years for the promised baby Isaac. And that was horrible. It was horrible for us preaching through those chapters. It was so horrible for them. They gave up multiple times. They cut corners and cheated multiple times. And that was 25 years. It's gonna be 400 years for God to fulfill this promise of a land. They're already dead and gone. Our idea of waiting is just different from God's. Let me say this. Some of you have prayed big things and prayed big things inspired by God's word and you've given up. How many of you have had a little journal and same request daily, weekly and eventually you just gave up? Or maybe you just took it as the answer was no from God. Maybe, but why? God's timing and God's idea of waiting is fundamentally different from ours. I wonder how many of us ought to go back to our old prayer journals and resurrect old requests which we've long given up on or maybe even accepted as a no from God and started knocking on heaven's gates once again. 400 years before God fulfilled this promise and yet he did. Abraham has a grave and a stake in the land which brings us thirdly, I want us to observe and finally a funeral. Verses 19 and 20. After this, Abraham buried Sarah, his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah east of Mamre, that is in Hebron in the land of Canaan. The field and the cave that is in it were made over to Abraham as a property for a burying place of the Hittites. I've had the privilege over the years of officiating many funerals and I say privilege unironically. It is a privilege to minister, to open up and speak God's word to people in the most intense moment of suffering before the reality of death. And I always try to spend some time with the loved ones who've just lost their beloved ones the week before the funeral. Of course, to comfort them but also to unashamedly and not in a hidden way to gather information from them about the one who has just died. Now, sometimes that's easy. You know, it's my family member or it's somebody I knew well, right? That's easy. The work's already done. I have to spend very little time asking questions but other times I've been asked to officiate a funeral and I don't know the person from Adam. I don't know them at all. And so this time is critical. And so I try to go to their house and invite loved ones, the wife, the mother, the son, the daughter, whoever. And I just take out a pen and a paper and I have a bunch of questions and I just ask them questions and I voraciously, hastily take down notes and I ask them to walk me around the house and see different items in the house and maybe cherished belongings or possessions of the one who has just died. I always ask to see their Bible so I can thumb through it and see, you know, where they folded the pages, what notes they've taken. And inevitably, what always happens, I take all these notes and then I go home and I've got this just, this just, pardon, but this vomit of notes. I've gathered all this information together and I look them over once again and a story starts to emerge from those notes, usually in the form of two or three or four words. And so patterns start to emerge, right? And it tells the story of this person. So one example might be, comedian, loved his family, suffered much. That might be one story. Or another, a feisty southerner. That's a theme in her life again and again and again. Prayer warrior. Boy, she prayed. And those words tell at least part of their story and that becomes a big part of the eulogy that I offer at their funeral as I try to not just extol God to the people in the hope of the resurrection, but also tell this person's story and honor their life. In verses 19 and 20, we have Sarah's funeral. It's brief and understated. I thought it'd be proper for me to give her now a proper eulogy, though I was not asked and I doubt I'll be receiving any kind of honorarium for this funeral. But I'm gonna give it in five words, which I believe tell Sarah's story and honor her as we meet her story recorded in God's word. So here's Sarah's eulogy in five words. Number one, beauty. Beauty. A woman so renowned for her beauty that every foreign king wanted her and every preacher thousands of years later preaching these stories is forced to explain how a woman so old could be so famous for her physical beauty and desirability. She was beautiful. And even as she aged, nobody in the world could deny her beauty. Her beauty became a stumbling block as we read these stories. She probably struggled not to make her appearance and her beauty her identity. And Abraham, her husband, used her beauty as a crutch and as a decades-long trick. They used it together. They survived in foreign lands and before foreign kings by her beauty. But in order to live a new life by faith, she had to learn a new way of life, not denying her outer beauty, but learning not to live by it and learning that there's something even more beautiful to pursue. Something which is eternally beautiful. Which brings me to the second word, servant. Servant. In 1 Peter, the apostle Peter gives a pastoral word to the women in his churches. It's a word more difficult for our ears to hear in 2023, which probably makes it a much more important word for our ears to hear. It's a word calling women not to live for outward beauty. Not because that's bad or wrong or we should walk around with whatever, trying to look our worst, but because there's something even more beautiful, a better sort of beauty. As an example of this better beauty that Pastor Peter is commending to the women in all the churches, he cites Sarah. Listen to 1 Peter 3. Do not let your adorning, speaking to women here, do not let your adorning be external. The braiding of hair and the putting on of gold jewelry or the clothing you wear, but rather let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty. Think about that phrase, imperishable beauty. Even Sarah got old and died. The imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very precious. God sees that beauty and it's precious. For this is how the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves by submitting to their own husbands. Just as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord and you are her children, you are Sarah's children if you do good and do not fear anything that is frightening. Now, let me be clear here. Sarah was no doormat to Abraham. She was the wiser of the two, for instance, after Isaac was born with respect to what to do with Ishmael and Hagar. She was wise, she was tough, she was bold. But Peter picks up, did you notice, on her gentleness, on her quiet spirit throughout the story of Genesis, which he says was very precious in God's sight. She was holy, Sarah was, and she loved God and so she submitted, Peter says, to her imperfect husband. She was a servant to all because she was a servant to God. Servant, third word, laughter, laughter. No way I could miss laughter with Sarah and at her funeral. Sarah laughed at God's word of promise when he had said she'd bear a son. She laughed and she denied her laughter. Her laughter was sin. It was the laughter of unbelief at the very words of God. It was scoffing, it was mocking. But she lived long enough to see God fulfill the absurd promise of a child in her old age. She got pregnant, she gave birth to a son, and then she named her son Laughter as God had told her to name him. And then she laughed once more after he was born. But this laughter was different. She was laughing now at the goodness of the God who she was learning to trust. She lived long enough to see her laughter, even her scoffing laughter, redeemed and renewed. Laughter, fourth word, faith, faith. It's important to say this because you know that that's Abraham's story. He's the man of faith. He's exhibit A. Paul wants to hold forth as the righteousness that comes to all by faith alone in Christ alone. Look at Abraham, the man of faith. That's how you're counted righteous, just like Abraham. But Sarah was right there beside him. The entire way, like him, she took missteps, she fell down, she backtrapped. It was she who suggested that her husband cheat on her with their servant Hagar and have a child. That was her idea. It was she who then got jealous of Hagar, who would have guessed this, and even Ishmael, and demanded Abraham banish them. But it was she who, like him, kept getting back up again and kept believing the promises of God and moving forward. Abraham believed God and it was counted to him as righteousness, Paul says, Romans 4.13. We could just as well say Sarah believed God and it was counted to her as righteousness. Sarah is in heaven today watching, cheering us on, Hebrews, worshiping because she learned to believe. The fifth and final word, mother. If I could just pick one word for this eulogy, it'd have to be mother. I remember as a child, I grew up in a Southern Baptist church in North Carolina and I remember there was a woman in our church who struggled with infertility. And I remember this, even as a child, what I know of these sorts of things, I remember this because she spoke of it so often. And every time there was a potluck meal, Southern Baptists in the South, every time there was a prayer meeting, every time there was anything where anybody could ask for anything, she went up to the microphone, she took the microphone, she wept and she pleaded for people to plead with God as she was pleading with God for a baby. It's all she wanted. And eventually, not as a young mother, she had child. And I remember even as a selfish bratty kid thinking, oh my, she must be the happiest mother in the history of the world. How much more so for Sarah, who waited for a promised child longer than most women live, longer than many women live. She waited and she waited and she waited. How much pain in her waiting, how many tears bottled up by God, how much anger perhaps harbored against God. And then at 99, she gave birth for the very first time. And in her old age, she nursed and she swaddled and she developed those spidey senses and superpower ears that moms develop in mothering. And Sarah became a mother. And not just a mother, Sarah became the mother of the people of Israel who come from her womb and even more, Romans teaches, of all who believed like she believes. Listen to the prophet Isaiah, Isaiah 51. Listen to me. You who pursue righteousness, you who seek the Lord, listen to me. Look to the rock from which you were hewn and to the quarry from which you were dug. Look, God says, to Abraham your father and to Sarah who bore you. She's the mother of all who believe. Beauty, service, laughter, faith, mother. Here lies Sarah, earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life. It's worth asking while I have your attention as this would be funeral. When you die and when the pastor comes to do some investigative homework at your house and with your family members, what words would he find for you and for your life? And what story would your life tell at your funeral? And is your story telling what you want it to tell? Sarah is now dead and Abraham finally has a stake in the promised land. This is life, isn't it? Finally, the victory we're waiting for. Finally, he's an owner right in the middle of devastating loss. Abraham has secured a stake, just a stake, but a real piece of property in the promised land. Ahuza is Abraham's. He's made a down payment for a future home and a better home and yet death is hastening. Sarah now and Abraham soon are coming to death and the promises are still far off. Hebrews 11 reminds us of this. I'll read it for you just briefly. These all, speaking of Sarah and Abraham and others with them, the author of Hebrews says, these all died in faith, not having received the things promised, but having seen them and greeted them from afar and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on this earth. For people who speak thus make it clear that they were seeking a homeland. If they had been thinking of that land from which they had gone out, they would have had opportunity to return, but as it is, they, Abraham, Sarah, desire a better country. That is a heavenly one and therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he has prepared for them a city and this is where this old story and these ancient caves, still controversial to this day, collide with our lives. We too have received a down payment as the church of the Lord Jesus Christ. If you're a believer here this morning and Jesus, a follower of Jesus, you have received a down payment of a future inheritance in Jesus and your down payment, like Abraham's, is also a grave. But your grave, my grave, our grave, if we're safe in Christ, is an empty grave for it's a grave where the Savior has already broken free from the chains of sin and death and charted a new path and a new world and a new home, a home in which we shall soon share. He's also given to us, if you're a believer in Christ, the Holy Spirit as another down payment, a token of the life and the world to come. 2 Peter 3 says of this inheritance to come, but according to his promise, we are waiting for the new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells. Any and all, please hear me, any and all, whoever you are, can find a share in this inheritance and can join in the hope of these promises if you will only believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. Like Abraham believed and like Sarah believed. Let's pray. God, thank you for the lives of our fathers and mothers before us in the faith, given to us as examples, as encouragements that we might too share in their hope. Oh Lord, we pray that you would awaken faith in hearts that have not yet believed even now. God, we pray that you would draw hearts to call out upon the Lord Jesus as savior, that down payments of better things to come might be received by faith now. And God, we pray that you would shore up the faith of all of us who believe. Give us confidence, give us longings for all that you've promised us in Jesus. It's in his name that we pray, amen. Amen.
