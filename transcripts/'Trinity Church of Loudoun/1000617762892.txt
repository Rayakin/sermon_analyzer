If you need me, call me. No matter where you are, no matter how far, just call my name. I'll be there in a hurry. You don't have to worry because, baby, there ain't no mountain high enough. There ain't no valley low enough. There ain't no river wide enough to keep me from getting to you. We're talking about a very well-known psalm this morning, so I figured it might be fun to start with a very well-known song. Maybe its own kind of psalm, in fact. Song, of course, is the famous song, Ain't No Mountain High Enough. It was written in 1966 by a man named Nicholas Ashford and a woman named Valerie Simpson. And the version you might be most familiar with was recorded in 1967 by Marvin Gaye and Tammy Turrell. And if you're familiar, it's about these two lovers for whom no physical distance or obstacle could keep them from getting to each other. Now, of course, that's tremendously romantic, really wonderful to know. But we're led to ask, are we not? Why are they apart? That's the thing that's kind of unsaid in the song. They have such strong desires for each other. They're assuming they're so apart that they might have to climb mountains to get to each other. They might have to ford rivers to get to each other. They're not even close. Somebody left town. Somebody is left alone. Marvin Gaye, he catches us up a little bit in verse 2. Remember the day I set you free? I told you, you could always count on me, darling. From that day on, I made a vow. I'll be there when you want me, some way, somehow. She wanted out, it sounds like. She wanted to be free. And so he granted that. But before he let her go, he said, listen, if you ever need me, give me a call. I'll be there. I'll make it back. If you're ever in trouble, I'll be there on the double. Just send for me. Oh, it's a key change. It's an awesome song. Musically, like, simple, catchy, but complex. But it is, as we kind of think about this a little more, it's also this sort of confusing, kind of sad song. Especially when the guy and girl are singing it together, to each other. Who is saying what? Who means what? Who broke whose heart? Something clearly went wrong. And they still care about each other deeply. They'll even look out for each other at great cost. But they'll do it, ultimately, from a distance. And if one of them actually ever does need help, they'll just have to trust that they will show up at some point in time. In fact, that maybe that mountain will be too high. Will that valley actually be, perhaps, too low? I hope not. They said not, but I hope not. Our psalm, this is one of the more on-the-nose introductions you might be able to tell. Our psalm today shows us a picture of love that stays close, that does not live on distance, that doesn't speak from distance, doesn't confess promises from a distance. Amen. A love that doesn't have to scale mountains or cross any valleys because it has never left. Psalm 23, you can start turning there if you haven't yet. It's one of the, maybe the most famous song in all the world, psalm in all the world. You've heard it. You've maybe even memorized it at some point in your life. And I offer that that's maybe the very reason why it's lost some of its power and impact in your life. That instead of reading it or hearing it, and really receiving what you're reading, really receiving what you're hearing, you just start thinking about how familiar this is to you. You just start thinking about, oh, I know what comes next. You start thinking about where you first heard this. You start thinking about how great a Christian you must be for knowing this so well. But if there's any psalm that defies self-satisfaction in those ways, it's this one. And before we look at it, we will look at it. But before we look at it, it may help us to get a better sense of the psalm, to see where it's situated in the flow of the psalms. Psalms, as you may know, are divided into five books. And the first book covers the psalms 1 through 41. So Psalm 23 is obviously in book number one. Fantastic. And there are a lot of different understandings about why those books are grouped the way they are, why those psalms are in those books. But one way to look at why book one exists is because those 41 psalms introduce the idea of confrontation. They show us the confrontation between living for God, living in God's way, and living according to the world. So you might think of Psalm 1, right? Blessed is the man who doesn't seat in the way of sinners, walks not in the way of the wicked, et cetera, but his delight is in the law of the Lord. That's immediately confrontation. There's also confrontation between God Himself and those who oppose Him. Psalm 2 immediately shows us this, right? The nation's rage, the people's plot in vain. Confrontation. And then a lot of the psalms, including this one, shows us the confrontation of God's promises, what God's character is supposed to suggest of Him, but in life's challenges that seem to conflict with that. The conflict, the confrontation, the contrast between what ought to be who God has said He is, who He has shown Himself to be once upon a time, and yet what I'm experiencing now. And the main author, really the autobiographer of these first 41 psalms is, of course, King David. And so when we look at Psalm 23, when we look at some of the psalms immediately before that, we're gonna see some of that confrontation reveal itself. So we're gonna look briefly at Psalm 20, 21, 22, just parts of them. You can turn probably just one page over in your Bible. Psalm 20, verse four. This is just helping us to get situated in Psalm 23. Psalm 20, verse four, David is writing either about himself as a king or about the king that God is placing in Israel. It's unclear. 20, verse four, in any case. May He grant you, may God grant you your heart's desire and fulfill all your plans. Big, big, strong declaration. May we shout for joy over your salvation and in the name of our God set up our banners. May the Lord fulfill all your petitions. Verse six, now I know that the Lord saves His anointed. That means His king. He will answer him from His holy heaven with the saving might of His right hand. Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the Lord our God. What's David saying? The king can trust God entirely. Some other armies might have more horses, more chariots. You have God, you have nothing to fear. God will save you, God saves His anointed. He loves to do that. He continues in a similar spirit. Psalm 21, verse one and two. Oh Lord, in your strength the king rejoices and in your salvation how greatly he exalts. You've given him his heart's desire. Remember that in the passage we just read? And have not withheld the request of his lips. So far so good. Verse 11, though they plan evil against you, though they devise mischief, they will not succeed, for you will put them to flight. You will aim at their faces with your bows. Talking about the enemies of God and the king. That's pretty amazing language. You will aim at their faces. Make no mistake, he's not just gonna injure them. He's not just gonna send them a message. It's not just a warning flare. He's aiming at their face. That's how confident David is in God's protection and provision for his king. And then we get to Psalm 22, verse one. My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me, from the words of my groaning? What? Verse four, in you our fathers trusted. They trusted and you delivered them. Verse six, but I am a worm and not a man, scorned by mankind and despised by the people. What happened? What happened to all that salvation? What happened to all that victory, God? David's clearly, it's unclear what he's experiencing here, but he's clearly in the middle of something where everything he perhaps knew, just a couple Psalms earlier, everything he banked his life on is now in question, is now not so certain, but he keeps going. Verse 26, he keeps almost talking to himself. Verse 26, the afflicted shall eat and be satisfied. Those who seek him shall praise the Lord. May your hearts live forever. Verse 28, for kingship belongs to the Lord. He rules over the nations. What's he saying? Clearly he's going through some stuff that's very real. He'd, knowing the God of Israel, he knows what God's promises are. He's even perhaps seen kings be installed and established and favored, and suddenly some stuff gets real in his life. God is forsaking him. God is far from saving him. So what does he have to do? He has to settle in his heart with hope in what he doesn't actually see yet. The afflicted shall eat. Those who seek him shall praise the Lord. God will deliver him. He will be satisfied because, verse 28 is so good, because he realizes, he acknowledges kingship is God's and not his. It's not his to possess. It's not his to insist upon. It's not his to ascend and retain. It's God's. It's all God's. And so that's where we're at as we approach Psalm 23. I'll read it for us once again. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. He restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness for his namesake. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me. Your rod and your staff, they comfort me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil, and my cup overflows. Surely, goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever. We'll see three movements in this psalm, and actually, we're only gonna look at the first this morning. Lord willing, return to the other two in a month. But in a phrase, in a sentence, it's this. The Lord shepherds you in the pasture, that's the first movement, and in the valley, because that's the way home. The Lord shepherds you in the pasture, that's what we'll look at this morning, and in the valley, because that is the way home. We'll look at those in a month or so. But first, the Lord shepherds you in the pasture. From the very beginning, David wants none of us to be confused. He doesn't want us to be confused about who he's writing about. This is not some generic, all-purpose, one-size-fits-all God. He's writing about Yahweh. So if you notice in your Bible, where it's all caps, LORD, maybe you've never noticed this before, anytime your Bible has LORD, the LORD, written in all capital letters, that's not translating a Hebrew title, the LORD. It's translating a Hebrew name. The name is Yahweh. So whenever you see that, you can insert a name in there, not just a title that can even create some odd distance. It's actually a tremendously intimate, personal, self-declaration of revelation of God. This is my name. That's who David is talking about here. Yahweh is my shepherd. Not the boss, the manager, the CEO, not the mayor, governor, president. Yahweh, I know his name. I am, is my shepherd, he's saying. What's significant about this? A lot is significant about this, just a few things for now. For one, it was actually really common for rulers, kings in the ancient Near East to view themselves as shepherds of their people. If you've heard of the Code of Hammurabi, Hammurabi was a king in Babylon a long time ago, and he wrote this code where he describes himself as the salvation-bearing shepherd. And of course, in that time, shepherding and just the agrarian life was most common. That was basically how society existed. So everybody would have understood what it meant, what it looked like for a shepherd to care for a sheep. And so these rulers would put themselves in that position. You know how you shepherd your sheep? I'm like that for you. It makes sense, and David is defying that. David is declaring that no, no, no, no, no man is actually a shepherd over other men. The only true shepherd, in fact, my shepherd, is Yahweh, is God himself. Not only that, what else is happening here? What's in David's background? What did he used to be? David himself was a shepherd, a shepherd boy. So much a shepherd boy that he was picked last to be king. He was so not like a king. Definitely a shepherd, definitely not a king. So this is a man at the time of this writing. He not only knows how these rulers of the times speak of themselves, he doesn't just know the language, the lore of viewing yourself as a shepherd. He knows literally what it is like to be a shepherd. He literally knows the life of a shepherd, the work of a shepherd, the perspective of a shepherd on the actual ground. Even further, if you were like most kings would have been at the time, if you were raised for royalty, you don't know what a shepherd is. You don't know what a shepherd does. You know as much of what a shepherd does as I know what a shepherd does. You've barely been outside, and when you're outside you got people fanning you. These kings don't know what they're talking about when they say I'm your shepherd, I'm the shepherd of these people. And further, once they become king, the amount of distance they had between them and their subjects, unbelievable distance, they didn't know them. They couldn't tell them apart. They might never know them. But that too is not like what a shepherd is like. A real shepherd knows his sheep. A real shepherd knows all of his sheep, and all of his sheep know him. There's a well-known book called A Shepherd Looks at Psalm 23 by a man named Philip Keller. He writes from the perspective of having lived and worked as a shepherd in East Africa for many years before becoming a pastor himself. I'll quote from this a couple different times, but he says this. Talk about his own experience. The day I bought my first flock, 30 ewes, so female sheep, I realized this was but the first stage in a long-lasting endeavor in which from then on I would, as their owner, have to continually lay down my life for them. Sheep do not just, quote, take care of themselves, as some might suppose. They require more than any other class of livestock, endless attention and meticulous care. This is a guy who lived it. David also lived it. And so there's something quite powerful, poignant, when he becomes king, Israel's shepherd king, and yet he says, no, no, no, I have a shepherd too. What does that mean? It means he knows he's a sheep himself. Those other kings don't know that. He does. Brothers and sisters, I wonder, friends, I wonder, have you known that? Have you known that you don't take care of yourself? And it's important here because we need to see that the whole psalm, it starts here because the rest of the psalm depends on this, depends on this being reckoned with and understood. The rest of the psalm is really just expanding on what that phrase is saying, that Yahweh is shepherd and what that must be like for his sheep. That's what this psalm is saying. It all starts from there. So we should ask ourselves. I want to ask you now. Have you, is that first line something you believe for yourself? That first phrase, the Lord, Yahweh is my shepherd. Is that your testimony? Do you find yourself in that phrase? Notice David isn't making just a general statement about the world. He's not saying the Lord is the shepherd, right? He's not even saying the Lord is our shepherd. He's saying Yahweh is my shepherd. Friends, it doesn't matter how well you know this verse. It matters whether this is your confession or not. That the shepherd and king of your life is not you, it's not anybody else, but it is the Lord. That you have realized, like David did, that kingship belongs not to you or anyone else, but to Yahweh. That you have realized, like David did, that having chariots and horses secures you no more than having God alone. All that's in the background of this phrase, the Lord is my shepherd, Yahweh. The rescuer, the promise keeper of Israel, the consuming fire of Israel is my shepherd. It's a declaration against the powers of the earth. It's an understanding of what God really must be like, and it's a confession. It's a personal confession of what your life, how you live your life, how you experience life. Is that your testimony? Have you felt the strength of knowing the Lord as your shepherd? Have you known the welcome of being able to call upon Yahweh as your very personal shepherd? David summarizes what that feels like in the next phrase. What's it feel like when you can say that, when you can know it, believe it? I shall not want. The literal phrase there is I shall lack nothing. When you have the Lord as your shepherd, what is your response? What's the conclusion? What's the result of that? The confession of the Lord as your shepherd continues. I lack nothing. There may not be a more counter-cultural thing to say today. Despite what every magazine cover would have you believe, despite what every ad for whatever your favorite shiny thing is, despite what every escape promises you, despite even just what we see around us, walking around day to day, the cars, the clothes, the homes, the people, the things we read about day to day, despite what they're all trying to tell you to believe, a person could be in the midst of all of that like we are on a daily basis and from a deeper place say I lack nothing. I lack none of that. Isn't that true wealth? Wealthier is the man who lacks nothing than the one who has everything. Think about that. Because as we all know, the pursuit of more is fueled by you always feeling like you are missing something. The pursuit of having more is fueled by, is powered by, relies on you feeling like you don't have enough. And as we all know, the sense of not having enough cannot be filled by having enough things. It will for a second, but boy how much we give for that second. How much that second costs us and never returns. This is the Shepherd book once again. The outstanding paradox is the intense fever of discontent among people who are always speaking of security. Despite historically unparalleled wealth, we are outstandingly insecure and unsure of ourselves and bankrupt in spiritual values. Men search for safety beyond themselves, restless, unsettled, covetous, greedy for more, wanting this and that, yet never really satisfied in spirit. By contrast, the simple Christian, the humble person, the Shepherd's sheep stands proudly and can even boast, the Lord is my Shepherd, so I shall not be in want. I am completely satisfied with his management of my life. What a difference. Brothers and sisters, what is it that you feel like you lack in your life? Kind of a touchy question if you really think about it, if you really want to be honest about it. What do you, insert your name, what do you feel like you lack in your life? If you had this, it would finally make life livable. If you had this, you would finally be able to say, I lack nothing. What is that thing? What is that first part of the phrase you're filling in to get to, I shall lack nothing? We all have answers to that question. And now here's where we can kind of get, try to get ahead of this. It feels noble, but it's really just a dodge. You might say, especially in an area like ours, well, all right, I don't live in a war zone. I have access to food and shelter. Okay, fine, I lack nothing. Happy? That is very important to realize and appreciate. But that's not the answer, because what are you doing? You're still just comparing yourself to other people's circumstances. Here's the thing, there will always be people in harsher circumstances than yours. Guess what's also true? There are always gonna be people in cushier circumstances than yours, right? So if that's your measuring stick, you don't have a ground, you don't have a foundation. Your heart's gonna have nothing else to do but to react up or down. There's nothing to steady it. You'll either just feel self-conscious or even self-righteous for knowing that there are these other people I should feel sorry for, or you'll just be discontent and even jealous that there are people who have more than you have and they might not even deserve it. Those are your options. The only thing that can steady you is to drink deeply what David is saying, what he has put before us. Yahweh, my God with a name I can call him, is, is, is my shepherd. It's to squeeze that thing. Only then will you see that you lack nothing. It's not, if my job is respected by people, if once my bank account is full, once my house is paid off, once my, as long as my kids are obedient, because my degrees are fancy, because my marriage seems perfect, because my body is impressive, whatever you feel like your lack is, you must realize nothing can replace the Lord is my shepherd and still get you to I shall not want. I lack nothing. Nothing can do that. You know this. We know this. And yet we return. But when we do realize that, we realize that nothing actually has to replace what David is telling us. Nothing has to improve upon the Lord is our shepherd. Because when you see that, when you see God as your shepherd, you finally, that's kind of what unlocks the rest of the psalm. You finally see life now as David describes in verse two. You stop zooming in on all that you feel like you lack and you're able to look up and see all that you have around you. You're actually able to see the grass and the water around you. I remember one of our members sharing their testimony with me. And he said this beautiful thing. He was converted in college and he said one of the immediate things he noticed was that he walked on campus and the world looked clearer. He literally said the grass looked greener. The sun felt warmer. Isn't that something like what might happen if your spirit of the world is exchanged with the spirit of God? It wasn't the world that changed around him, right? It was him finally having eyes to see that all of this, all of this is a gift. Think of all that you've been conditioned to take for granted. Think of how unexceptional we feel it is to be alive. We don't think that that's a big deal, right? We think that's okay, kind of, that's something we sort of like take for granted. We don't think that that's very exceptional, that's anything worth noting. Think about what it takes for you now, for these days, for something to genuinely stir gratitude in you or wonder in you. Probably takes a lot. Probably takes a lot more than the fact that you're breathing right now. That you didn't tell your lungs to do a thing. It takes a lot more than your heart pumping blood all throughout your body without you telling your heart to do a thing. These very basic things that we take for granted without which in minutes you are dead. And yet, it's ho-hum. Isn't that amazing? The mind you've been given. The safety with which you came to church this morning. The meals that have fed you up to this point. Bigger picture, the doors that have been open for you in your life. The pitfalls that God has redirected you away from. So much we take for granted. Things we don't even think are worth thanking God for. That's how we operate. I'm not gonna thank God for, I mean, that's every day of my life. Do we hear ourselves? Where do you think it comes from? Aren't grass and water similarly unspectacular things? Unexceptional things to sheep and yet they are literally what God is using to keep them alive. Friends, you and I are no different. God is using a thousand, tens of thousands of things every second of your life to keep you alive. You are surrounded by pastures and waters that you did not put there yourself. And that leads us to realize what's special, what's David saying? He's not saying the grass and water are special, right? This is key. He's saying what's special, what matters, is the God who provides them. He doesn't just say he gives me grass and water, as precious as that is, as important as that is. What does he say? Feel the tone of what he's saying. He makes me lie down. He leads me. He's talking about God, not the stuff. What's anchoring him are not the provisions so much as God's personal care for him. It's knowing that the shepherd is present that turns the ho-hum grass of his life into a symbol of peace. It's knowing that God has provided even this ho-hum water in his life that turns water into a symbol of rest. We've all noticed these things. We've all had experiences like these in life, right? When something very familiar to you, something you've eaten a million times before, a place you've visited a thousand times before, but because of how you felt that morning, something you realized about God this past week, something about it makes you appreciate the gift of all of it a little more. We've all experienced this. That's what David's talking about. The thing itself is what it is, but do you know who it's from? It's from Israel. It becomes even more fascinating when we think about what Israel's terrain is like. Any of you, maybe you've been there. I've not. I've seen pictures, though, and I don't think any of us would mistake it for New Zealand or pictures of New Zealand that I've seen. It's a lot of desert, a lot of rocky ground. Grass. Not what you might imagine the ideal place to raise animals that depend on grass. So how do they do it? How do they graze in a place like this? Where do these green pastures and quiet waters come from? Once again, from the book. They don't happen by chance. They're the product of tremendous labor and time and skill, the result of clearing rough and rocky land, of tearing out brush and roots and stumps, of careful soil preparation, of seeding and planting special grains and legumes, of irrigating and husbanding the forage that would feed the flocks. Shepherds must also know where the best drinking places are. He understands weather patterns and seasons. He reads the animal and plant life around, and he doesn't stop searching for water until he finds a body of water or a well or an area that's suitable for water to collect. Then he can begin to work so that his sheep will rest. That's what a shepherd does. That's how grass and water show up in a dry and arid place. The shepherd pretty literally puts it there. Yeah, the sheep might prefer endless rolling hills of grass, a much more wet climate. You know what happens though? Wetter ground, what happens when sheep fall? They don't really get up that easily. You've heard this a lot, right? The thing that seems so good to sheep, the thing that seems so good to sheep, seems so preferable, actually endangers them. More water, more parasites in what they're drinking. In a fascinating way, the dryness, the aridness of the Middle East is its own sort of protection for the sheep, despite it not being what they prefer. Can you see the overlap of that in your own life? What has God put in your life that, man, would you realize, it's actually keeping you from being worse off, from loving the world even more than you already do, from falling into its ways and its persuasions even more than you're already prone to. What has God put in your life that is an obstacle to that? A church, a people, brothers and sisters, who will care, who will listen, who will ask, who will wonder. Challenges in your life that are actually the thing that are keeping you praying to Him and seeking Him, rather than sitting on your high horse. Friends, if you want to truly appreciate what you have in your life, who doesn't want that, to really appreciate what you have in your life? If you wanna appreciate it, you need to see that nothing you have is by accident or coincidence, nor is anything you have a monument to your own abilities. You did not put it there. As long as it's those things, the things I have are because I earned them, or the things I have are just accidental, coincidental, happenstance. As long as you see them that way, your heart will actually never be at rest. You will never be content. You'll only find whatever grass you have as restful, whatever water is around you as peaceful, is when you look at them and trace back to them coming from God's own caring hand for you. If you just see them as themselves, you're gonna be prone to just comparing, right? Oh, theirs is newer, theirs is better. I don't know, so you have to double-click on them. Where did it start, where did it come from? It didn't come from a store. It came from God and his care for you. You have to do that to get to contentment and level ground. And that's what we can, when we believe that the Lord is our shepherd. And that brings us to verse three. He restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake. In 2018, there was an article in The New Yorker titled, Improving Ourselves to Death. Tremendous title. If you've read the book, Amusing Ourselves to Death, I think it's a play on that, which is also a tremendous book. You can kind of guess what the author's point is. She writes, in our current era of nonstop innovation, our fuzzy, wishful thinking has yielded a hard doctrine of personal optimization. So she's saying the things we just sort of assumed might, could be, or things we could aspire to, maybe, are now things we believe should be optimized about ourselves. Self-help gurus today are psychologists with impressive academic pedigrees and a commitment to scientific methodology. Or they're tech entrepreneurs with enviable records of success in life and business. What they're selling is metrics. It's no longer enough to imagine our way to a better state of body or mind. We must now chart our progress, count our steps, log our sleep rhythms, tweak our diets, record our negative thoughts, then analyze, recalibrate, and repeat. In a consumerist society, we're not meant to buy one pair of jeans and then be satisfied. And the same is true of self-improvement. We're being sold on the need to upgrade all parts of ourselves, all at once, including parts that we did not previously know needed upgrading. Should also add that in 2018, it was estimated that the self-improvement industry brought in $10 billion a year. Boy, do we love things wrong with us. Just like having more, having more is a bottomless pit and pursuit. The irony is that the more consumed we are with improving ourselves, the less satisfied we will become with our lives. Don't you see that? That's obviously how it works. The more inadequacies we will see, the more weaknesses will bother us. We may improve some areas of our lives, but at the cost of turning life into a competition that you have to keep playing, but you will never win. Of course, the opposite isn't the answer either. What is it? Self-neglect, irresponsibility, sitting around, no goals, no self-discipline, hour after hour, wasted away, consumed by consumption. I would say we probably all know the emptiness of that. Oh yeah, I'm not gonna care about, optimization is a silly pursuit. I'm just gonna resign to not, no, that's not the answer either, of course. The shepherd leads us a different way, not to you becoming the best you, not to endless and endless, filling yourself with as much as you can. What does he say in verse three? What's the path? It's a path of righteousness. It's a way, it's a path where life is no longer about you, in fact, but it's about who's in it. Who's name? His namesake. And that, we can only get there, that can only come when our souls feel secure enough to finally let go of having our way. That's when your soul is restored to its proper place. When you realize, oh, I was not made to, designed to live for me. That's the great brokenness of the fall, isn't it? Oh, we're gonna live, I'm gonna live for me and mine now. Restoring, the word for restore there is actually the word return. It's returning to what your soul was designed to do and be, how it was designed to feed and prosper. It's not living for yourself, it's living for his namesake. So what image does that give us? We have the sheep, fat and happy sheep, after resting where the shepherd has brought them, they get up. They can't just sit there forever, they do get up. Where do they go? Where do they walk? They get up and follow their shepherd. They don't go off onto their own way. They don't chase their instincts, they don't trust their instincts. They trust the shepherd's instincts more than they trust their own. They trust the shepherd's wisdom and curiosities more than they trust their own. They've given, they've set that aside. He knows better than I do. He knows where water is. Isn't that how life is best lived? Haven't you tasted that yourself? Haven't you experienced the satisfaction of knowing God's love for you? And from that, from the joy of knowing he loves me, from that, wanting to actually do what he says. Haven't you experienced that? It's not so begrudging, it's not so embittered, it's not so arm twisty. The God of the universe knows my name and loves me and gave himself for me. Oh my goodness, what do you want of me? What do you want from me? Send me. The life of righteousness being richer than the life of me, myself, and I. I wonder if you've tasted that. Even to use an example, maybe kind of practically. Think about, if he sets us on the paths of righteousness, tracing it back, if we lack nothing, if we're content, what kind of righteousness does that breed? Think of the 10 commandments. The pattern is fascinatingly mirrored here. The one who can say, the Lord is my shepherd, I shall lack nothing, is the same one who can look at the 10 commandments and look at the beginning of it. I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the house of slavery, I am your shepherd. And go down to the 10th commandment and say, yes, you shall not covet anything that is your neighbor's. I shall lack nothing. That's how this works, guys. We start with who God is. But we get this backwards all the time, don't we? We do it upside down. We think, I'm gonna live righteously, I'm gonna show God what righteousness looks like. Then he will have to restore me, and then even more, he'll have to provide pastures in my life, won't he? I earned it, that's my wage. Boy, I never say that. But think about the discord and turmoil in your heart, and you could probably trace it back to some species of that. I did so I deserve. Brothers and sisters, there's a far better way. It's to consider that if God is our shepherd, what does a shepherd demand of a sheep? Nothing but to listen to him. He doesn't demand anything of you. He doesn't expect you to show him your righteousness. He simply calls you to be what you are. To be hungry and thirsty. To come to him with a needy soul. To ask him to lead you, your whole life. That's what it means to know Yahweh as your shepherd. And of course, how do we even see this more vividly? What's Yahweh's other name, let's say? It's Jesus. Jesus. Jesus, an even better shepherd than David ever was. And he says it this way in John 10. My sheep hear my voice. I call them by name and lead them out. I go before them and they follow me, for they know my voice. Why do they follow him so confidently? Why do they know his voice and trust it? Not, as he says, because he's not a hired hand who doesn't own the sheep and doesn't care about them, because he's a shepherd who lays his life down for them. The sheep have seen that in their shepherd. Jesus Christ, your shepherd, he shows you his care, not simply by leading you, not simply by being an example for you to follow, but by finally dying for you. He's a shepherd who trades places with the sheep, who becomes a lamb sacrificed for our sin, all of our living for our own sake, walking in our own paths of wickedness. He died for that. Who could be more committed to your good than the one who would have done that? Indeed, ain't no mountain high enough, ain't no valley low enough. Because as we sang, tis so sweet to trust in Jesus and to take him at his word, just to rest upon his promise and to know, thus saith the Lord. Yes, tis sweet to trust in Jesus, just from sin and self to cease, just from Jesus simply taking life and rest and joy and peace.
