God has made magnificent promises to Abram, and I keep isolating three particular promises. Let's see if you got them by now. Three promises God made to Abram, Genesis 12, and really the whole story's about them. What are the three promises, do you remember? Let's go, come on, you're listening, we're learning, we're growing together. People, place, and blessing, right? God has promised to give Abram, from Abram, a people, an inheritance, heirs from Abram's own loins. God has promised to give to Abram a place, the promised land, which he's now in and settling in as a sort of Bedouin, and he's not there permanently, but he's made it to the promised land, and God has promised to give to Abram and to place upon Abram his blessing, salvation to Abram and through Abram to all peoples. Well, this morning, the story of Abram and the story of God's promises really reach a sort of climax in Abram's dealings with God. Genesis 15, verse six, in many ways, is one of the very highest of all the mountain peaks of God's dealing with man in the entire Old Testament as we read that Abram believed God and God counted it to Abram as righteousness. This is one of the apexes, the summits of the entire Bible, certainly of the Old Testament, but we've got a lot of climbing to do before we get to that summit in verse six, and along the way, we find Abram's interacting with fear, his own fears and doubt, his own doubts, and ultimately, Abram interacting with and wrestling with the trustworthiness of the promises of God. In that sense, Abram really is just like us, and we, even this morning, have much to learn from this encounter with Abram and God. So we're gonna look at these six verses and we're gonna look at them and I'm gonna give them to you under four headings. So if you're a note taker, if you wanna know where I am and not get lost, I'm gonna give you a bit of a roadmap here before we get started. First, we're gonna look at Abram's fear in verse one, fear. Second, doubt in verses two and three, doubt. Third, renewal in verses four and five. We're gonna look at God renewing his promises to Abram, renewal. And then finally, fourthly, the apex of this mountain will arrive to saving faith in verse six, saving faith. There is no other question in all the world more important for you to answer this morning than this. Do you have saving faith? Have you genuinely believed in God in such a way that God has saved you from your sins and you're eternally secure? There's no other question in all the world more critical for each and every one of us to answer than that this morning. And we're gonna look at this story of God's dealing with Abram and ask God to give each of you an answer to that question. So first, let's look at Abram's fear. Let me read verse one for you one more time. After these things, we read, the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision. And here's what God said. Fear not, Abram. I am your shield. Your reward shall be very great. Chapter 15 begins, as you can see there, with a vision. In fact, there are two little phrases there that are very peculiar and absolutely essential to understanding what is happening there. One is that word that we just saw and I just mentioned, vision. The other is the word of the Lord. Those two phrases throughout the Old Testament are always and only and exclusively used of prophets. So Abram here is being cast early in the story of the Bible as one of God's prophets. Remember, at this point in the story of humanity, there is no Bible. Oh, how privileged you and I are today to have the fullness of God's revelation. Even great father Abraham does not have what we have, the Bible, has not yet been written. And so God is revealing himself to man and to mankind bit by bit by giving words from the Lord. He's coming to people in visions, to people like Abram. So here, Abram has a vision. God invites him into a vision. Visions aren't dreams. The person who enters into a vision in the Bible, they're like dreams. God reveals himself in both ways. But in a vision, the person is wide awake. How awesome is that? And as we can see here, individuals are allowed to see things or to enter into other realms even. Think of the apostle John in the book of Revelation. That entire book is a vision. It's John entering into a vision where he's allowed to see other worlds, sort of see what's happening behind the scenes, so to speak. In visions, as you can see here in Abram's vision, individuals can dialogue with God. In this vision, God speaks to Abram and Abram talks back and God answers. So there's a real dialogue happening. God speaks to Abram just like he had in chapters 12 and 13. And curiously, I want you to see here in verse one that God begins this word and this vision by addressing Abram's fears. Apparently, Abram has grown afraid. He's just come off the battlefield, victorious over the four kings from the south. Is he afraid that they're gonna return? Now with more firepower? You know, you take 318 men and you have an upset victory over powerful, sinful, bloodthirsty kings from another territory, you may as well put a bullseye on your back. Abram's just turned down all the spoils offered by the king of Sodom. Remember the bribe the king of Sodom offered to him? Abram chose rather to receive the blessing from the mysterious king Melchizedek, which came with no money, nothing but bread and wine and a blessing. He just earlier before that, chapter 13, gave to his nephew Lot the better choice of the promised land. Maybe Abram's starting to wonder if any of this is worth it. And when is he finally going to get his? He's left his home and his kindred and his moon gods and everything he knew at 75 years old all to follow the voice of a God who made big promises to him. But he's still not seen any of those promises realized. He's still wandering in the land. He's still constantly at threat and he's still childless. God speaks here to Abram in his fear and he reminds him, I want you to see, of two things. And I hope you'll hear God's voice speaking to your fears this morning in these two reminders. First, God reminds him, he speaks to him and he says, Abram, I am your shield. Fear not, Abram, God says, I am your shield. Abram is a foreigner in a strange land surrounded by enemies. God is telling him, Abram, you're not only surrounded by enemies, you're also surrounded by me. I am your shield. Why did your 318 men overtake the four kings and their men? Because I was your shield. Why are you safe in a land surrounded by potential enemies? If you know the story of the Bible, all these people Abram keeps encountering are the future enemies of the people of Israel. Why? Because God is his shield. Whatever Abram could see and hear, God was inviting him here and you by faith to believe that he was always covered, always protected on every side by God who was his shield. Some of you are constantly afraid. Fear is a powerful drug after all. You know it's a sociological fact that great leaders grow great followings and great power by stoking your fears. Politicians, presidents, and yeah, you better believe it, pastors, grow large followings by preying upon and churning up your fear. You wanna unite a people, you wanna get a people excited, you wanna grow something, get the people afraid and speak to their fears. And after all, there are so many legitimate threats, so many things for us to be afraid of. The threats to our health, to our kids, to our country, to our churches, and on and on and on we go. But God has not given you a spirit of fear, the word of God says, but a spirit of power and love and self-control, 2 Timothy 1 verse seven. What a comforting thought for you and for me this morning. God has promised to be your shield too. What are you afraid of? Sickness, bills, other beliefs from other people, out there, other powers out there, aging, dying. Whatever you see with your eyes, whatever you hear with your ears, God promises he surrounds you too and will be your shield too if you trust in Christ. That doesn't mean you're invincible, but it does mean, listen, it does mean that so long as God is sovereign, there is no threat, not even death itself, which can ever come early and depart from his permission. Let God speak to you this morning in your fears. Oh, Lord, how many are my foes, David cries. How many are rising against me? How many are saying of my soul, there's no salvation for him and God? Selah, just sit in that for a moment. How many are my threats, David says. How many are your threats, we could all say. But you, oh Lord, are a shield about me, my glory and the lifter of my head, Psalm three. He's a shield for us. Secondly, notice God promises to Abram, speaks to Abram in his fears, not just that he'll be a shield, but secondly, he says, your reward shall be very great. Your reward shall be very great. Again, God's promised Abram great rewards from the beginning, people, place, blessing, people, place, blessing. Abram's turned down other rewards to wait for these rewards of people, place, and blessing, and to date, he's seen nothing. He has nothing. When I was nine or 10 years old, I collected cards, baseball cards, basketball cards, NFL cards, everything, and I was talking one day about them at school, probably bragging about them, when a girl named Jasmine asked if I had any B.J. Armstrong cards. Some of you remember B.J. Armstrong, one of the sidekicks to Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen on those dominant 90s Bulls teams, and this girl had a massive crush on B.J. Armstrong, and she told me that she'd give me $10 for a B.J. Armstrong card. Now, she has a huge crush on B.J. Armstrong. $10 was more money than I'd ever seen in my entire life. This was a win-win. I immediately struck that deal. We had a deal. The next day, I brought her the card, and sure enough, she gave me a fresh Alexander Hamilton, and just like that, I was rich. I made a huge mistake that night after my deal when I told my parents. Kids, you need to know that I was, you should tell your parents, and I was kidding when I say that, but I need to tell the rest of this story. I told my parents, and they told me that I couldn't keep that $10 from that girl because it was an unfair trade and that I had to give it back. Then they proceeded to also tell me, they didn't require this, but they strongly suggested that since she wanted this card so much, that I should give this girl this card as a gift along with my $10 since she liked it so much. My parents were awful. They were like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Now, I was devastated. It was your classic rags to riches story, and just like that, within a day, it was right back to rags. My parents, sensing my devastation, I remember, you know how you remember little random things, little scenes, little, I literally remember this scene at night in my home when my parents assured me that if I did what was right here, God would work it out for me in the end. Now, whatever they meant by that, you know what I heard by that. I heard that that $10, it was, yeah, I was gonna give it back to her, but it was only temporary. It was only a matter of time before some pebble I was playing with and I overturned turned out to have $10 taped underneath it, if not 20 or 30 or 40 or something bigger than that because God would reward me for being good. I wanna report to you that, to my knowledge, now some three decades later, I've still not seen that $10. We all believe in the prosperity gospel by default until we learn better, don't we? But listen, because here's the wild truth of the gospel. That terrible kid theology in me and honestly in most of us that we start out with, that terrible kid theology is actually half right. God really is that good and God really is that lavish and God really does reward those who wait on him and who trust in him. He just doesn't promise to do it here and now. That's the half that's wrong and that's the half that's poison if you believe it. We will live forever. Think about it like this. You're gonna live forever. All of us live forever, but there are two sides to our eternal living, our eternal life. There is the one side, the here and the now, a mist, a vapor, we're here and we're gone. You blink a few times and it's gone just like that, right? And there's loss and there's suffering and there's waiting and there's missing out all the time on this one side of eternal life. But on the other side, forever, there is God and there is a place where God will give us everything and where we will be with Christ forever. God really is that lavish, far more lavish than I could have ever imagined at 10 years old. Your reward will be very great. Your reward if you trust in Jesus Christ. That's not prosperity gospel, that's the real gospel. You really will be that rewarded for following Jesus forever lavishly in the next life. Those who hope in Christ will never be put to shame. You will see your reward. You just have to wait. God speaks to Abram in his fear. Secondly, look back with me at the passage. I wanna address and look at how God addresses Abram's doubt, doubt. Now, Abram responds to God. He speaks back in his vision to God and Abram comes out with what's been brewing in his heart. You can see here he's struggling with doubt and I want you to notice that his doubts, Abram's doubts all have to do with the promises of God. That's really important. All of his doubts directly relate to the unfulfilled promises of God. Look at verse two. But Abram said, oh Lord God, what will you give me? God just said your reward will be very great. Abram says, what will you give me? For I continue childless and the heir of my house is Eleazar of Damascus. And Abram said, behold, you've given me no offspring and a member of my household will be my heir, a servant in my home right now is going to be my heir. God promised to Abram a people. Abram's 75 years old, in Ur of the Chaldeans, God says, if you follow me, come out and follow me, I'll turn you into a people. Abram says, oh, okay. And off and following him he goes. It's been a decade now. Abram's 85 years old or thereabouts. He's been following the speaking God for 10 years and he's still childless. Genesis is a book all about seeds. You remember this, why? Because in chapter three, verse 15, the first promise of the gospel, God promises even as he's cursing and judging mankind that has just turned on him and become sinners. God promises that from the woman, from some descendant, however far away of Adam and of Eve, shall come a seed who will crush the head of that evil serpent and abolish evil forever and make everything right once again. And so the whole story of Genesis is about seeds and it's really about that one seed and looking for that seed. So we keep seeing seed, seed, seed pop up again and again and again. Here, Abram is looking at God and saying, God, no seed. You see, still no seed. Same word as 315. As things stand, Abram reminds God his heir is Eleazar of Damascus. Now who is Eleazar of Damascus? Exactly. Many commentators believe that Abram basically took out a sort of insurance policy by doing what we know from history, people around the same time and other comparable cultures did, in adopting a son from another family when you were barren as a sort of insurance policy. So many believe that Abram, sometime in his travels, passed through Damascus, picked up Eleazar from some other family. Such a person, Eleazar would have served, if that's who Eleazar is, he would have served Abram and Sarah, maybe manage some of their affairs in their home, their finances, et cetera. And in exchange, he would be their heir when they eventually died. That seems as likely as any other explanation as to who this Eleazar was. This is all we get about him in all of the Bible. But even that, as plausible as that is, even that, I feel, sort of misses the point. The point is the obscurity. The randomness. Eleazar from Damascus? Who in the world is he? Abram has the promises, the promised people, the heir of all things, this new nation that's gonna come from Abram's wound and be the nation of blessing for the whole world. Eleazar of Damascus! Poor Eleazar of Damascus was probably a wonderful guy. Probably a great guy. And yet, what we have here is Abram giving voice to his doubts. Where are your promises, God? Where is my seed? Where is my child? We all experience doubt in one form or another throughout this life. Kids, as you get older, you're very likely going to experience doubts about lots of things, including about God and about the Bible. And I wanna tell you, probably the worst thing that you can do is to bottle those doubts up and hide them in shame. It's perfectly normal to experience doubt. Most all of us do at some point in some way. And parents, if I could speak to you, I think we wanna make it a safe and normal thing for our kids to honestly voice their doubts to us so that we can have opportunity to engage them with the promises and the truths of the gospel. Would you rather them talk to you about their doubts or the internet? Abram's doubt here, I want you to see, it was a mixture of belief and unbelief. That's what doubt often is. It's not just straight rebellion. Otherwise, it wouldn't be doubt. It's a mixture of belief and unbelief. He's holding onto these promises. He's looking, waiting, counting on God for 10 years now, waiting for God to come through for him. That's belief. But his eyes aren't lying. And they're still not coming true. So he's wavering, he's waffling, he's questioning. How long, God, are you sure about this? He's experiencing unbelief. And the best thing he does is he brings these complaints to God. He brings these questions, these concerns, these doubts in the form of complaints, he brings them to God. Do you know that you can do the same? When was the last time you cried out to God? God, your word says this, and I've been praying this and waiting on this, and I'm still waiting. Are you listening, God? Where are you? Do you know that you can go to God like that? Doubt can turn to faith and even serve faith if you'll bring your doubts to God. Abram voices his complaint to a God who could destroy him. And let's see how God responds. Third, let's look at God's response to Abram in renewal. Renewal, God responds to Abram's doubts and Abram's complaints, how does he do it? Look at verses four and five. In verse four, he renews his promise. And behold, the word of the Lord came to Abram. This is God's response in the vision. This man, Eliezer of Damascus, shall not be your heir. Your very own son shall be your heir. And then he invites Abram outside, God does. Now remember, this is all still happening in a vision and like virtually every vision that comes in the Bible, for whatever reason, they always happen at night. And so outside, God invites Abram to look up. Verse five says, and God brought Abram outside and he said to him, look towards the heavens and number the stars. If you're able to number them. And then he said to him, so shall your offspring be. This is the second time, I wonder if you notice, this is the second time in the story that God has renewed the original promise from chapter 12, that God's gonna take Abram and turn him into a people, to give to Abram a people. And I wonder if you've noticed how each time, God has used a different illustration to make the same point. In chapter 13, God told Abram, if you can count all the dust of the earth, so shall your offspring be. Here in chapter 15, God invites him outside, he has him look up at a starry night and he says, count all the stars. If you can, so shall your offspring be. Later in chapter 22, verse 17, God's gonna renew the promise a third time. And here he says, I will surely bless you and I will surely multiply your offspring as the stars of the heaven and as the sand. Third illustration, dust, stars, sand. As the sand that is on the seashore, dust, stars, sand, all the same promise. It's like God wants Abram to look down and look around and look up above him in the heavens and to find everything he can find in the entire earth that he can't count. And see that as a reminder. Of God's promise and belief. Abram had once worshiped the moon and the stars like everybody else in Ur of the Chaldeans where Abram came from. Now God invites Abram to look at those same stars which he once made idols out of and in them to see the promises of God. I don't think he'd ever look at the stars the same again. I imagine, I have to imagine from here forward in the story, when Abram saw another starry night, he probably smiled. To be honest, for you and me who have the fullness of God's revelation and all of God's promises, it's hard to find anything out there that isn't some signpost for some promise of God. Shields, God will protect us. Rainbows, he's turned his bow against us, away from us. He'll never destroy the earth by flood again. Rocks, God is our strength. Snow, we've seen no snow this year. Unbelievable, no snow in Northern Virginia. We need to see snow again, why? So our kids can get off school and so that we can be reminded that God has washed our sins as white as the snow. Isaiah 118, honey, his word is sweeter than honey in honeycomb. Wine, his blood shed for the forgiveness of our sins. Bread, his body substituted for ours upon the cross. Lions and lambs, his raw power, his tender sacrifice. Doves, his Holy Spirit, he's always with us. Clouds, all his witnesses, all those who have gone before us trusting in the promises, seeing their reward and are now cheering us on. The sun, or white horses if you like, he will return to judge and to save. And of course, the stars. I grew up in the church and I was a youth ministry kid in the 90s. We used to sing this song. I have no doubt some of you sing this song called Sometimes by Step by Rich Mullins. Oh God, you are my God and I will ever praise you and I will seek you in the morning. Sing with me. And I will learn to walk in your ways. In the 90s kids. And step by step you'll lead me and I will follow you all of my days, amen. For whatever reason, I don't know about you, those of you who just sing, but we only ever sing the chorus. But there's another line from one of the verses that I only discovered as an adult where Rich Mullins wrote and it says this. Sometimes I think of Abraham. How one star he saw had been lit just for me. Now look, I know that song is too cheesy but that's so good. Sometimes I think of Abraham. How one star he saw on that dark night was lit just for me. Under the dark canopy of Palestinian skies, Abram scanning the expanse for every shining light in the heavens because God has told him to just toying with him until he, he's told him to count until he can't count any higher. Maybe Abram eventually just tapped out and said infinity. I can't go, I don't know any more numbers. And every star God says represents a descendant, an heir. Even you and me who by faith, Galatians 3.17 says, are sons and daughters of Abraham. Jesus didn't die for a faceless crowd or some blob of human potential. Jesus died for names. Abraham, Noah, David, Ruth, Esther, Mary, Peter, John, Frank, Phil, David, Cassie, Katie, names. We sometimes sing the song that says my name is graven on his hands. We could also sing your name is written in the stars. There's one with your name on it and one with mine by faith in Christ. God renews his promise here. And once again, he strengthens it. He makes it stronger. Which leads us finally to the matter of the day, the matter of the morning, the matter of this passage and really the apex, the summit of this mountain peak in the book of Genesis in saving faith. Verse six, let me read it for you one more time. And he believed the Lord, Abraham believed the Lord. And he, the Lord, counted it to him, Abraham, as righteousness. Let me say it again, inserting the characters for clarity. And Abraham believed the Lord and the Lord counted it to Abraham as righteousness. Kings behind him, maybe they'll return for him, still surrounded by foreigners in the promised land, now following Yahweh for 10 years, 85 years old, still childless, it's all he's thought about for 10 years. That's 3,650 days of probably super annoyingly staring at Sarai's womb every day. Anything today, any movement, any growth, how offensive. And beneath the stars, we read that Abraham in this moment believed God. Abraham in this moment kept on believing God. In this verse, verse six, we arrive at the summit of this vision and really of Genesis, maybe even the entire Old Testament. Genesis 15, six is sort of like the John 3, 16, if you will, of the entire Old Testament. This is the gospel preached from the Old Testament in one verse and Abraham believed the Lord and it was counted to him as righteousness. Now, when you arrive at a summit, for all you climbers out there, what do you do? I have no idea because I don't climb things. I don't find that fun or entertaining, but I respect those of you who do. But I imagine what you do when you get to the top is you stop and you look around and you take a few photos and selfies and you take it all in. This is it. This is what you train for. This is what you prepared for. This is what you climb for. To reach this point, you stop and you take it all in. And so that's what we wanna do with this one monumental mountain peak verse in verse six, just to sort of slowly take it all in. I wanna do that by carefully helping you to look at three massive words here. And for the sake of clarity, I decided at the last minute this morning that we're gonna look at them in reverse order as far as they come to us in the passage. So three words, and we're gonna look at them in reverse order. The first word I want you to look at is righteousness. Righteousness. We read that God counted it to Abram as righteousness. Now, if I were to give everyone in this room right now, kids and adults, a blank slip of paper and a pen, and I were to ask everyone in this room to write down one thing, one word, which represents your biggest need, the thing that you need right now in life more than anything else. Think about that for a moment. What would you write down? Don't say it out loud, but imagine in your head what would you write down? I imagine a lot of us would say similar things, but I also imagine it would form a really long list. Some of you would write down a job, a raise, a new boss, a house, a car, a friend, a girlfriend, stop, a spouse, a child, a child I have to behave, sleep, just one night's sleep, and on and on and on we could go. Again, a lot of us would say the same things, but the list would begin to be pretty long. I wanna tell you, listen to me, I wanna tell you God is my witness that if we all took seriously the word of God or if we could somehow all just be, excuse me, if we could somehow all be transported in a vision like Abram to the gates of heaven where God resides and where entrance is permitted or denied, I wanna tell you that we'd all write the same thing. There would not be two answers in all this room and the same thing we'd all write is righteousness, heaven's only requirement without which no man or no woman shall ever be permitted into the gates of heaven, into the presence of God, and the one thing which none of us has, righteousness, the one thing apart from which all of us will be sentenced eternally to hell. Adam had it for a moment, but he lost it with one bite of fruit. We've all since Adam been born into some other state, unrighteousness. It's all we know, but that doesn't make it normal and it still reeks in heaven. But listen, Abrams found it, righteousness. So early in the testimony of the Bible, we're meeting a man who's found the one thing which we all lack and the one thing which God requires, absolute, total perfection. Righteousness. Later, when the law comes, 431 laws. It's possible I'm wrong on that. I should've looked that up before I decided off the cuff to say what I'm saying right now. Something like 431, something like that, laws come from Sinai. Righteousness later is defined as you've kept perfectly all your life without any exception every single one of those laws. That's righteousness. Abram, before the law is ever given, has found it. How? Second word I want us to stare at together, counted. Counted, we read that he, God, counted it to Abram. Counted, the word here could also be translated as considered or reckoned or credited. Every once in a while, watching a sports event or attending a sports event, a scoreboard official will reward or award points, at least for a moment, to the wrong team. Like I'm playing against Dave in a match and I scored and Dave gets two points to his credit. And boy, you wanna see benches clear and grown men acting like absolute children, throwing a hissy fit. The injustice, no, those are my points. What is wrong with you? You should go to jail. You wanna see people get offended. My gosh, we earned that point and you gave it to them. Of course, these days, instant replay, television, everything else is almost always fixed and corrected. Now that silly, trivial illustration is getting us close to this word and this idea and what this word means when we read that God counted it to him, to Abram as righteousness, this idea of points being counted to the wrong team, only listen carefully because this is the gospel. God in Jesus is doing that very thing, counting, awarding, crediting the wrong team and he's doing it in mercy on purpose. Only one man ever actually earned that status on his own merit of righteousness. It's not Abram, it's Abram's heir, the Lord Jesus Christ, the only one ever to live throughout all of his life, thought, deed, action, everything without any mistake, any blemish, any mark against him, never sinned in any way righteousness. And the scandal of the gospel is that God is taking what he and he alone earned and counting it to others, crediting it to others, scoring it to others. God is giving Jesus his reward to the other team. I imagine every devil has cleared every bench of hell every time God has declared another sinner righteous. And of course, there's a sense in which they're true. This isn't justice, no, foul God, you can't do it. She's a sinner, she didn't earn that, it's true. Righteousness is not earned, it's a gift. Listen how, turn with me to Romans four, we've already read from there this morning, we'll go right back and finish in Genesis, but turn with me to Romans four. Let me see, let me show you how Paul takes this idea and this concept from this story in Abram and understands and views it as a lens through which to understand the gospel. Let me pick up reading in verse three. Romans chapter four, verse three. For what does the scripture say, Paul asks. And then he quotes from Genesis 15, six, this apex, this mountain peak, this gospel from the Old Testament. Abram believed God, Abraham believed God, he's skipping ahead in the story with the name, Abraham believed God and it was counted to him as righteousness. Now, listen to Paul's logic here. To the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift, but as his due. And to the one who does not work, but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted, same word, see how he's just jumping off of that same word, counted as righteousness. Now let me tell you what Paul means here in the simplest of terms. You work, you get paid. And when you get paid, your boss isn't being a hero, he's not doing anything nice for you, you don't owe him anything special, he's avoiding jail by paying you. Yes? Nothing special about what he's doing there. You earned your wages and he paid them to you, that's why they're called wages. Wages are something that is earned. But this is the gospel, salvation, eternal life cannot be earned. Nobody can earn it. You can't work long or hard enough, that's why the idea of purgatory as a side note is so absurd. I don't care if you work in the next life 10,000 or 10 million years, what's that ever gonna do or say about the 70 years here that you offended God? But God, though we could never earn salvation, but God by sheer mercy and grace is taking the real righteousness of Jesus actually earned by a man who was also God and he's crediting it to your account. This is the gospel. This is the scandal of the gospel. You believe this? This is true of you? There's, there's, there's, this is everything. Let me read for you from the end of Romans four if you're still there. Let me pick up now in verse 22, show you where Paul turns next. He's still speaking of Abraham, using him to illustrate how the gospel works. That is why his, Abraham's faith was, and then he quotes again, counted to him as righteousness. But the words it was counted to him, now listen to this good news, the words it was counted to him, Genesis 15, six, were not written for his sake alone, but for ours also. It will also be counted to us who believe in him, who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord, who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification. Do you understand that word counted? Credited, considered, counted, hallelujah, counted. Third, last word, believed. Believed, and Abram believed the Lord. Abram believed the Lord. This is what the Bible calls faith. This here, we're watching before us, this is genuine saving faith active and put on a movie screen for us to watch. Saving faith, and because this is the pinnacle moment, a pinnacle moment in the Bible, I wanna make a number of observations about Abram's faith. So hang with me here. I know we've already been going for a while, but we're on the mountain peak. We gotta stop, we gotta look around. I read this week that if you get to the top of Everest, the people that do that, you can only stay up there for 20 minutes because the oxygen levels are so bad up there that a lot of people die as soon as they descend from Everest, and so you only get 20 minutes up there. You gotta take it all in real quick. Well, we can at least do, give me 20 minutes or 30 minutes or 40 minutes or whatever we need right here. Number one, let me make a number of observations about Abram's faith and your faith. First, I want you to see this. Faith is not obedience. I'm about to show you four things, all four of them matter immensely for how you understand the gospel for your eternal life. First, faith is not obedience. If verse six said conversely, and Abram obeyed the Lord, and it was counted to him as righteousness, that would, one word, that would change the entire message of the Bible. I would immediately convert to Roman Catholicism, and that would be devastating, terrible news, because it would mean that you're in my salvation. Us getting that status of righteousness depends upon our obedience, but it doesn't say, and Abram obeyed the Lord, and it was counted to him as righteousness. It says, and Abram believed the Lord, and it was counted to him as righteousness. Now, genuine faith proves itself by obeying. That's the entire message of the book of James, right? Genuine faith does, over time, obey, but Moses, God, the Bible, this early in the story of redemption, so early in the Bible, wants to memorialize for Abram and for the entire world that faith saves. Faith justifies. Faith alone saves. Faith is not obedience, amen? Second, faith is only as good as its object. Faith is only as good as its object. The verse says, Abram believed the Lord. What's the object of Abram's belief? Don't fall asleep. What's the object of Abram's belief? The Lord. The object of Abram's faith is the Lord, and that's everything. That's why it was counted to him as righteousness. This matters immensely because everybody, everybody, I don't care who you are, everybody has faith in something. Some God, some belief, some theory, something about myself, my intelligence, my hard work, my being a generally good person, or my being a better person than those other bad people that I compare myself to. I've said this many times before, but many people today just have a vacuous sort of faith in faith. You know what that sounds like? It sounds like this. Well, you just gotta have faith, right? People say that all the time. You just gotta have faith. You just gotta believe. No, wrong. Faith in what? Faith in faith is meaningless and will save nobody. Recently, I was diagnosed with strep throat. The doctor prescribed me with a round of amoxicillin. Hallelujah, praise God. I went home, poured a big glass of water immediately, and swallowed my first pill, and I'm telling you, could've been placebo, I don't know, but I'm telling you, within an hour, I felt like a new man. No more pain. Now, what healed me? My swallowing, the water. What actually healed me? The drugs, man. But I had to swallow the pill. We're gonna give you a book at the end of this service on your way out. Let me give you a quote just to tease your appetite just a little bit to flesh out what I just, the unoriginal illustration I just used. Listen, this is what Piper says in What is Saving Faith. Faith saves in the way that swallowing a pill heals. But the pill, not the swallowing, contains the disease-killing, health-giving power. Faith receives Christ. Christ saves. What saves? What healed me? The drugs. What saves? Christ. What got those drugs in my body? Swallowing with water. What gets Jesus into your soul? Faith, you see? In that sense, Piper says, faith saved. Faith is only as good as its object. That's actually wonderful news. If the object is Jesus, hang your hopes on Jesus. Everything. Third, a word of encouragement to you this morning. Third, a faith that slips, falls, fears, and doubts is still faith. A word of encouragement for you this morning. A faith that slips, falls, fears, and doubts is still faith. Abram, need I remind you, pawned off his wife to Pharaoh in Egypt three chapters ago. Abram was afraid four verses ago. Abram was complaining and doubting two verses ago. And spoiler for where we're going, Abram's still not done falling down on his face yet. Listen, I don't think this is an accident in the story that God is telling for us in Abram. Abram's a mess. He's still a mess, even in Genesis 15, six. And right in the middle of his mess, God memorializes his faith and declares to all future generations, counted righteous. Abram really believed. His life really shows that he really believed as he keeps on getting back up after he does fall down and he keeps on following God's voice. This is wonderful news for fellow messes like us. Believe and keep on going. Fourth, finally, faith summons from God an instantaneous declaration of righteousness. Let me say that again, it's a mouthful. Faith, we're almost done. Faith summons from God an instantaneous declaration of righteousness. Abram believed God and it was counted to him as righteousness right then, right there, instantaneous. Listen, when you believe, the moment you believe, I just almost in my mind picked this up and pounded as a microphone. The gavel of heaven is pounded before all the angelic host to declare before all of the heavens that another one, he or she has been declared righteous forever. The moment you believe, that means, that means God could declare you righteous today. That means if you believe now, God could declare you righteous for all eternity. That's what justification means, to justify you, to declare you righteous, to give you that status heaven requires and which none of us has. That means God could give you that status right this very moment if you believe. You've got the rest of your life to work out following him. That's sanctification, that is a process that takes the rest of our life and we never finish until heaven. But justification, God's declaration and God's gift of righteousness is instantaneous with your faith. Believe righteous, God says. Here in Genesis, at this maybe first summit, mountain peak of the Bible, God is telling you how righteousness is found. And what is said here is consistent with what's said everywhere else in the Bible. There's only one way to find the righteousness of God, by faith and by faith alone and by faith and by faith alone. Faith counted as righteousness. Do you see the gospel? Do you hear the gospel? Faith counted, credited as righteousness. Abram found it, fearing, doubting, he nevertheless believed. Have you believed? Nothing else matters. You could have wrecked your life. You could have done everything. Your parents and your teachers ever told you. None of that, it may have consequences in this life. None of it matters for your eternal security. One thing matters. Do you believe? The word here for believe is the word from which we get the word amen from. So every time we pray, one of the reasons I love it when people join a day of praise in Jesus' name, amen, several of us say amen. You know, what are we saying? We're saying yes, belief. Belief, me too, belief. Have you believed? Without righteousness, you will stand on your own merit and you will surely fall. The Bible says that our righteousness, our righteousness is as filthy rags before God. With Christ's righteousness, God is for you forever and your reward shall be very great. Let's pray. Amen. God, thank you for all the bread crumbs you've left for us in your word, all pointing us and pulling us towards the same thing in the Lord Jesus, the climax of all of your promises, your ultimate yes to everything you've ever promised to us. God, thank you for the Lord Jesus. God, we confess once again that we believe. Yes, amen, we believe. Oh God, would you help our unbelief? And God, for those who have not yet trusted in the Lord Jesus, God, we believe that you have power by your Holy Spirit to give belief even now, this very moment, under the sound of my voice and to declare righteous for all eternity. And so God, we who believe all ask on behalf of those who have not yet believed that you would grant belief for joy, for salvation, for pardon. And we pray all these things in Jesus' name and we're all gonna say together, amen.
