John 6 38 through 39 and chapter 10 28 through 29. For I have come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me and this is the will of him who sent me that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me but raise it up on the last day I give them eternal life and they will never perish and no one will snatch them out of my hand my father who has given them to me is greater than all and no one is able to snatch them out of the father's hand this is the word of the Lord I have friends I do have friends I have friends who have left the faith over the years and friends from college for example some who were just as on fire to study God's Word to passionately worship to evangelize to try to evangelize their friends friends from college or after who have who have since walked away and no longer believe I have members of my family who have left the faith and now deny it I know pastors who have left the faith some of my seminary professors have left the faith I have books on my shelves written by Christian authors who no longer call themselves Christians I'm gonna throw the books away they just sit there some of them walked away for sin for a woman women are not sin you understand I hope some of them walked away for suffering and unanswered prayers some of them walked away for doubts and unanswered questions some of them walked away and I have no idea why they walked away and I'm not sure that they have any idea why they walked away life is hard and sometimes makes very little sense when I was a kid I didn't really pay attention to sermons so if you're a kid now sitting under my sermons I would encourage you not to follow my example and I had very little interest in theology but there's one doctrine and that's exactly what it was that I remember picking up on even as a young kid mostly disinterested in most of what I was hearing from the front of the church and the doctrine went like this as I heard it once saved always saved maybe you've heard that along the years the the the more technical name for that doctrine is the perseverance of the Saints but I heard it in in my Baptist Church in North Carolina as once saved always saved I remember hearing that and I think I heard it because I liked it I remember liking that one once saved always saved but I have to say decades later isn't it self-evidently false faith is a fragile thing people walk away from it all the time people experience salvation seemingly and turn around or turn their backs and walk away sometimes angry sometimes peacefully all the time so far in this series on the doctrines of grace I've done my best to show you a number of things God is way bigger than you or I ever imagined on our own Oh the depth of the riches of the wisdom and power of God how unsearchable are his ways how inscrutable are his judgments I've tried to show you that you and I apart from Jesus are far more sinful than we ever imagined I tried to teach you the doctrine of total depravity I've tried to show you that God has loved you if you're in Christ God has loved you for for far longer than you ever imagined even if you didn't know it God's grace for you began before time so we looked at election together and for the last few weeks we've studied how grace has entered into time purchasing people by the powerful blood of the cross and then calling those people by the same powerful voice that created the heavens and the earth today we finish this series by asking one final question will grace keep us to the end will grace keep you Christian who's experienced grace will grace keep you to the end to the end of our lives and to the end of the age even when you and I stand before our maker grace began before time grace has collided into time will grace hold on to you and keep you to the end of time and I want to teach you this morning the preservation of the Saints so I'm gonna like many others before me I'm gonna tinker around with what you've maybe more commonly heard in the perseverance of the Saints and I'm gonna teach you what I think is a better way of capturing a precious doctrine in the preservation of the Saints not the perseverance of the Saints but the preservation of the Saints and I'll tell you why that matters I hope as we go so if you have your Bible open up to John 6 I apologize in advance I'm gonna be right between John 6 and John 10 and really no more in one or the other than the other and and really in no particular sequence I'm gonna bounce back and forth between these two passages which so closely mirror one another and I want to I want to make and I want to show you three observations from these precious words of Jesus in John 6 and John 10 as we close down this series on grace three observations all about preservation number one preservation is Jesus work preservation is Jesus work so look at John 6 let me read for you again some of the verses that Caroline just read for us John 6 39 and this is the will of him who sent me Jesus says that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me but that I should raise it up on the last day and then in verse 40 he repeats again and I will raise him that is him who the Father has given to me and I have I have captured as it were I will raise him up on the last day and then over in chapter 10 parallel verse an idea again showing us clearly the work of Jesus chapter 10 verse 28 says this Jesus again speaking I give them eternal life and they will never perish why because no one will snatch them out of my hand preservation is Jesus work we've seen over this series that Jesus came on a mission he was sent on a mission by his father and his mission was for a specific people who he calls my sheep so Jesus came to this earth on a mission for his sheep they were chosen before time loved even before time their names were written in the in the book of life before time he died for them in time he laid down his life for those sheep this was him fulfilling his mission he then called out to them they recognized his voice and they followed him this was his mission and it was an open secret he talked about it all the time he came for a people he came to call the people he came to give his life for a people called his sheep and he's saying here that he will see this mission through he will complete it he's not going to lose a single one he's saying he's he's gonna raise every last one every one of those sheep given him by the father he's gonna keep them and raise them up on the last day he's gonna resurrect them they will not perish they will not fall away this was his assignment if he fails it speaks to his character and also to his competency if you hang out with me in the lobby after the service I meet you and I say to you yeah I'll call you this week or I'll email you this week and I don't do it that either speaks to my character I was just speaking just just wanted to get rid of you and wanted you to think I was a nice guy I didn't mean it speaks to my character or my competency I forget things all the time it could speak to both I forget because I don't care if Jesus fails in this mission it either speaks to his character or to his competency if he loses a single one was he not able was he not strong enough was he not willing to put in the work did he get tired or distracted of course not he's the obedient son the true son of God and his obedience is your only hope for salvation in the surrounding verses to our passage this morning and some of the verses we looked at in John's gospel of the last several weeks Jesus acknowledges various threats to his sheep who he's dying for calling and now promising to keep to the last day he acknowledges threats all around them there are thieves and robbers in chapter 10 verses 1 and 8 these guys these characters thieves and robbers appear twice there are wolves in chapter 10 verse 12 so the sheep that Jesus is is promising safe passage for in salvation for they're surrounded by threats they're thieves robbers wolves there are Pharisees he's speaking about and and and false prophets there are false teachers people stand in the place of God and speak for God all the time and misrepresent God there are people who stand in the place of and on behalf of God just like I'm doing right now and who effectively tell lies about God for your wallets for your applause for the power or control that you can give to them for your allegiance and if you give them your souls you will lose your soul because they're lying about God they will devour your souls for their own gain just like Israel's false shepherds in Ezekiel 34 who eat the sheep but Jesus is saying Jesus is the Good Shepherd he lays down his life for the sheep he'll give his own body to be devoured by those wolves to save yours and here I want you to see Jesus says even more than that we've already seen that he lays down his life for the sheep here he says even more no one will snatch them out of my hand why because no one cares to because no one's interested in your soul because no one will try wrong thieves robbers wolves everywhere no one is able no one is strong enough that's what he's saying not only does he laid on his life for the sheep he also resurrected king of kings that he is will guard the sheep forever by his power there is no thief there is no robber there is no wolf in all the world powerful enough to steal the sheep away from the shepherd that's what he's saying for I'm convinced Paul says Romans 8 38 39 for I'm convinced that neither life nor death nor angels nor rulers angels fallen angels demons rulers nor things presence nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor anything else in all creation none of it nobody will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord nothing nobody at times a family has to cross a parking lot or a road in order of course to get to the other side and if there are moving cars I tell the younger ones to hold my hand and so they reach up and they take my hand and it's cute and it's sweet and it's a Kodak moment but you all know and I know you've all heard this illustration a thousand times just like I have but I've got nothing better you all know just like I know even if they don't know that what really matters in that moment and in those instances is not they're holding on to me but my holding on to them in fact the more moving cars there are and the faster those cars are moving the tighter I'm holding in fact there have been times crossing a busy road where I'm not only gripping their little hand I'm basically carrying their entire bodies while they're holding on to me their feet aren't even touching the ground anymore I'm basically dragging them through the air life is really short and it's also a really long journey all at one in the same time lots of bumps along the way thieves robbers and wolves abound suffering and pain abound life is smooth for a season and then one day you wake up in the middle of the highway cars flying around at you in every direction no idea how you got here you really think you can hold on the entire time you think your grip strength is that strong you think you know the way on your own to the other side why will you wake up tomorrow and still be a Christian people walk away all the time why will you wake up tomorrow and still believe because you're sensible because you're humble because you're intelligent because you're just that stinking godly you'll hold on tomorrow and every day for the rest of your life if you hold on for one reason you'll hold on if he's holding on to you if he's clenching you sometimes carrying you as you walk and I walked carelessly through the traffic and into the traffic he will hold you fast I also learned a song at that church I grew up in it's actually an african-american spiritual and it went like this he's got the whole world in his hands he's got the wind and the rain in his hands he's got the little tiny baby in his hands he's got you and me brother in his hands he's got you and me sister in his hands he's got the whole world in his hands Jesus does and who can steal from the hands of Jesus preservation is Jesus work second thing I want to show you from these two mirror passages preservation is the father's work preservation is the father's work I want you to notice now how in both passages Jesus anchors his work and his power to save and to keep and to hold he anchors that into the father's work and the father's power did you notice that look at look at John 6 again verse 38 for I've come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me speaking of his father obviously verse 39 and this is the will of him who sent me that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me but that I should raise it up on the last day again for this is verse 40 for this is the will of my father that everyone who looks on the son and believes in him should have eternal life and I will raise him up on the last day I type out my sermons sometimes I go off script right now I've got this entire thing sometimes I go off script that's when I say my offensive stuff Jesus never goes off script that's what he's saying here he never ad-libs he never once improvised in his life everything he did was all according to plan the entire mission was perfectly planned by his father every name was written in the book of life before the creation of the world and then the son was sent for them and the son did exactly as he was told now why does this matter I think it's fascinating but why does this matter here's why this matters Jesus in appealing to his father and his father's will and strength is somehow if you can imagine it he's somehow strengthening an already unbreakable promise of power turn over to John 10 let me show you what I mean John 10 and verse 29 says this my father who has given them to me is greater than all and no one is able to snatch them out of the father's hand I and the father are one do you see what he's saying by appealing to his father Jesus somehow takes his unbreakable power and he doubles the power and doubles thereby the the guarantee of his promise it's like when a college student goes to goes to lease a new apartment or home and has his rich dad co-signed the lease for him except that the college student isn't a broke zero credit human being in this instance is the very son of God and on top of that Jesus is saying on top of his signature written in blood we now have his father's as well doubly guaranteeing if you're a Christian here this morning you are secured in your salvation by the grip of the Savior the Son of God but Jesus is saying you who sit firmly in Jesus the father himself has also taken his powerful hands from which nobody can take anything away and clamp them around the son's hands so you're doubly secured and actually John doesn't talk about it here Jesus doesn't talk about it here but you're also sealed by the Spirit so you're triply secured Christian but I've run out of hands God himself father son Holy Spirit will keep you and guard you until the end that's what Jesus is promising here listen by the way to the witness of the entire Bible this isn't just one teaching let me just take you on a quick journey around the New Testament to show you just a sampling of how this promise reverberates through the entire New Testament you don't have to turn with me just listen along carefully Philippians 1 6 Paul says I am sure of this that he who began a good work and you a good work of salvation he's talking about will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ 1st Corinthians 1 7 through 9 Paul says as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ who will sustain you to the end guiltless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ God is faithful by whom you were called into the fellowship of his son Jesus Christ our Lord he will sustain you to the end Colossians 3 3 & 4 for you have died and your life Christian is now hidden with Christ in God when Christ who is your life appears then you also will appear with him in glory there are no if statements here no footnotes these are promises 1st Peter 1 3 through 5 we already read it earlier in the service let me read it again blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ according to his great mercy he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to he's caused us to be raised to an inheritance that is imperishable undefiled unfading kept in heaven for you you who are you you who by God's power by God's power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time Jude 24 & 25 now unto him who is able to keep you who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before the presence of his glory with great joy who in the world could possibly present any one of us before the great glory of the Holy One in all our sin only one only one is able to keep us and present us blameless because he purchased us by his own blood but for the presence of his glory with great joy to the only God our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord be glory majesty dominion and authority before all time and now and forever amen the question is not can you lose your salvation my friend I want to assure you if salvation is a thing to be lost you're gonna lose it and so am I but I've been trying my best to show you these last seven weeks salvation is not a thing you attained it's not a thing you achieved it's not a thing you fell into it's not a thing on which you hold on to in your own hands nor is it a thing therefore you could ever keep it is a powerful work entirely of God start to finish a much better question to ask then can you lose your salvation would be this can a soul can a soul purchased called secured by God the Father and God the Son and God the Holy Spirit can that soul ever be lost or taken away by any devil in all of hell who would dare to even try I'm using as I as I alluded to earlier I'm using the language of and I prefer the language of preservation to perseverance and I'm very wary of the language of perseverance of the Saints so that's how most people talk about what I'm teaching this morning that's what I was taught when I first encountered this teaching from the Bible because I agree with many who suggest it's not the best wording for this reason it seems to suggest that we are guaranteed in our own persevering you see what I'm saying like we're guaranteed that that we ourselves are gonna are gonna make it to the end that we'll have what it takes that salvation in other words is in our hands and if it's in our hands I have to ask why wouldn't we lose it but it's not in our hands the entire Bible testifies it's not in my hands it's not in your hands it's in God's hands that's why it's better to say the preservation of the Saints because that more clearly gets across that the Saints are being kept they're saved they're kept they're preserved by the Father's powerful hands faith is a fragile thing strong today and you or me a wisp tomorrow barely alive but faith attaches itself to the all-powerful one who made the heavens and the earth that's the power of faith it's the power of God by the way so many churches today seeing almost exclusively maybe entirely songs which are all declarations of our will so here I take my stand I love you God you know what I'm talking about I will stand I will never back down I am this I am that I shall do this I shall not do that now please hear me very carefully because I want to I don't want to dismiss all that the Psalms and the psalmist do sometimes make declarations like that I shall fear no evil I will sing to the Lord a new song but hear me careful on that when that that stream all flows one way yeah you you just sing and hear songs like that all the time that just flows one way from me to God I will do this I declare this I will do this I will do that when that stream becomes the mainstream that we live in and and see and breathe and believe do you see how dangerously close we are to turning this entire thing on its head the message of the Bible is not that you will do this or you will do that the message of the Bible is you tried and failed and you didn't even try if we're honest you didn't try that hard we've all failed and fallen short of the glory of God but God did God has done Jesus has done that's the only reason that foundation for why you will do anything we would never sing I will hold me fast I will hold me fast no I would it are you kidding me what would we sing prone to wonder Lord I feel it as we just saying here's my heart Lord take and seal it you better steal it because I'm I'm drifting away every day we are kept by God's power and God always finishes what he started he's never quit a game he's never done half a job he has zero plans to retire ever that is your confidence that is your hope for salvation and it's your only hope for salvation so what role do you play in all this what role do I what role do any of us play in all of this game of endurance if you could think about it like that to the end we must endure Jesus is clear Paul is clear if you don't endure to the end you will not inherit the kingdom of God and so what is our role that's where I want to finish this morning and I want to say this for our third point I want to make one final observation from these two passages third perseverance and I'm changing the word there and you'll see why I hope perseverance is your work preservation is Jesus work preservation is God the Father's work perseverance is your work now I need you to really lock in because if you miss if you miss here what what I say here then then we're all in trouble one way you could hear me this morning and everything I've said so far and and I think the way the devil would want you to hear my sermon thus far as this is that is that God has done it all God has it all in himself not 99% but 100% and yes so far I did I would say that I would stand by that so therefore God has done it all God God has it all in his hand so therefore just sit back and relax and enjoy the ride to heaven our minds go there because we don't do well with tension but the Bible never goes anywhere near there the Bible tells you God's done it all it is finished and then it turns right around and it says to you therefore get to work therefore watch yourself therefore be warned when you get when you dabble into sin and hang on for dear life by faith even in our passage this morning this is what I want to show you this third point this is a triumphant note about the power of Jesus and the power of the Father to call you to save you and to keep you until glory but it still appeals to you doesn't it did you notice that it still calls you and me to action look at chapter 6 back and forth we go back and forth and back and forth and back and forth chapter 6 verse 39 let me read it for you again let me accent something different in the passage 639 and this is the will of him who sent me that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me but raise it up on the last day what are we talking about so far God God God God God and God and everything God has done and everything his son has done this is the will of him who sent me that I Jesus should lose nothing of all that he who sent me has given me Jesus but raise it up on the last day that's all the father that's all the son but then in verse 40 he says for this is the will of my father that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him who we talking about now we're talking about you we're talking about me everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life flip over to chapter 10 it's not just in chapter 6 it's also in chapter 10 verse 27 my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me you see what are the sheep doing here not just not just sitting there doing they're hearing recognizing and following so I want to close this sermon I want to close this series by taking you to one more time I did this once before taking you to the book of Hebrews towards the back of your Bible you can turn there if you'd like and I want to show you the so-called warning passages in the book of Hebrews Hebrews is probably my favorite book in the Bible and it's a book well it's a book about what don't answer out loud but think about it what is the book of Hebrews about you might say it's a book about the cross the atonement because it talks about the atonement as deeply and as richly as maybe anywhere else in the Bible and you wouldn't be wrong you might say it's a book about Jesus the great high priest because Hebrews big revelation is that Jesus is the fulfillment of all those types and shadows from the old priesthood from the old covenant Aaron and all of his his children he is the great high priest again you wouldn't be wrong but that's really telling you what the book says it doesn't get at why the book was written and therefore what this book is about why was the book of Hebrews written why was this letter written in the first place it was written to a group of recent converts to the gospel to Jesus to Christianity from Judaism who were tempted due to the influence of thieves robbers wolves to go back to Judaism to go back to the law which Jesus has set them free from and so chapter 12 verse 1 says so so in other words it's it's a book really the entire book was written to call people these people who were flirting with disaster shipwrecking their faith it's calling them to hang on to endure it's really a book about endurance and so chapter 12 verse 1 I can show you so many places where this just bubbles up let us run the author says let us run with endurance the race that is set before us why was Hebrews written was written for endurance that you might endure is given to the church for endurance I know some of you love Lord of the Rings I know some of you don't care my favorite character in the Lord of the Rings has always been since I watched the movies Samwise Gamgee Frodo's faithful friend he's a nobody he's a homebody the ring didn't come to him he can't do the job on his own he's a background character he's he's a prop on the stage like this microphone right here or something like that there's nothing impressive about Samwise at all but he's just there he's always there cheering Frodo on fighting for him when he needs sometimes picking Frodo up on his back and carrying him at the end of the two towers Frodo's done and he's ready to quit he just made it to Mordor to the gates and he he was there he could have gotten rid of the ring he could have finished this awful mission and finally been done with it all but then they were captured at the at the very last second photos just done I got so close and I'm far again and he's ready to quit and he just tried to actually give the ring up to one of the evil wraiths and in that moment Frodo says to Sam I'm gonna read for you a quote here at the end of the two towers Frodo says to Sam I can't do this anymore Sam I'm not gonna whine like Elijah Wood did in the movies but he's totally whining here I can't do this Sam Sam's response Samwise Gamgee I know Frodo it's all wrong by rights we shouldn't even be here but here we are it's like in the great stories master Frodo the ones that really mattered full of darkness and danger they were and sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy how could the world go back to the way it was after so much bad has happened but in the end it's only a passing thing this shadow even darkness even this darkness must pass a new day will come and when the Sun shines it will shine out all the clearer those were the stories that stuck with you mr. Frodo that meant something even if you were too small to understand why but I think mr. Frodo I understand it now I know now see folk in these stories they had lots of chances of turning back only they didn't they kept on going that's Samwise Gamgee that's Frodo's faithful friend keep that's his entire book this is his entire character keep going mr. Frodo just keep going don't quit now I'll carry if you need to on my own back you got to keep going listen I'm telling you that to say Hebrews I thought about this for many years I haven't got a better opinion now Hebrews is the Bible Samwise Gamgee it's a book for weary struggling tempted to turn back tempted to quit Christians it's a book to to how it's a it's a lifelong companion cheering us on often encouraging us sometimes yelling at us warning us don't fall back Hebrews is saying finish you're so so close just finish many others has finished chapter 11 chapter 12 said look at the great Hall of Faith all this great cloud of witnesses they made it they're here they crossed the finish line they're looking at you they're cheering you on don't quit now can you hear their voices don't turn back you've found Hebrews says you've found the great treasure there's nothing else in all the world don't go back to vomit you found the pearl of great price in Jesus Christ is this long letter and in the middle of this letter there are five solemn warnings I wanted to read them all to you but they're long and my sermons already long and I was for once in a gracious mood this morning at 8 a.m. and so I'll just now summarize these five warnings for you warning number one beware of neglect that's from chapter 2 beware of neglecting this great salvation which you have encountered warning number two beware of unbelief that's from chapters 3 and chapters 4 beware of unbelief if these all sound similar that's because they're all oh so it's like he's turning one thing around and around and around just looking at different angles warning number three beware of spiritual immaturity that's in chapters 5 and 6 it's okay to be spirit we all start out spiritually immature but if you stay there forever if you're a grown man or a grown woman following Christ for decades and still can only handle meat the author of Hebrews suggests that very much calls into question whether or not you actually have the Holy Spirit inside you because the Holy Spirit produces life and maturity beware of spiritual immaturity warning number four beware of shrinking back and giving into sin that abiding sin within you don't tolerate it don't give into it it'll grow and fester and take over your life beware of shrinking back chapter 10 says and then the last one warning number five beware of refusing God you who hear his voice you who see his witnesses from the Bible from the from the ordinances from the Lord suppers we're gonna share to beware of refusing God chapter 12 those warnings I want to say a few things those warnings are written to Christians they're given to churches like ours so Hebrews says as loud as any other book in the Bible it's finished it is finished Jesus did it all there is no other and yet Hebrews is also a book full of warnings written to and for Christians why because you must endure you must persevere or you will not make it to glory you must look by faith now and forever upon the Son of God and live or you will not make it to the next world you must follow Jesus and so I want to do here as we close the sermon and really close this entire series I want to give you more properly one of those warnings one of those five warnings because it goes so well with what I'm teaching this morning and what Jesus shows us in John 6 and John 10 and I want it so therefore I do want to end this sermon series with a warning it's the second warning against unbelief and it begins in chapter 3 I'm just gonna give you a taste of it these warnings by the way are like chapters long Hebrews 3 verses 12 and 13 here's the warning take care brothers and sisters lest there be in any of you an evil and unbelieving heart leading you to fall away from the living God but exhort one another every day as long as it is called today that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin that's all I want you to see do you see how he gives warning and then advice he gives a warning beware of unbelief be aware of an evil unbelieving heart festering inside of you but then he gives advice after what do you do if you see it we so helpfully gives practical advice exhort one another live with each other later in chapter 10 he's gonna say building upon that do not neglect meeting together he's talking about church as summer in the habit of doing but again encourage one another and all the more as you see the day approaching here's what I want you to see as we close as we think about God's preservation and our own perseverance to the end you do not persevere alone you will not persevere alone and I need you all to hear me on this some of you will not make it to the end I don't know who I don't have any kind of insider information I just know that in a room like this the math says all of us will not make it to the end my life anecdotally says all of us will not make it to the end and I want you to see that the most vulnerable among you are those of you who are basically trying to do this on your own this week I watched more YouTube shorts of lions attacking wildebeest don't know how we got there I can't have zero control whatsoever of what they put up in front of me you know you know how that works it's complicated algorithms I don't understand I just have to do what it what it says what it puts in front of me and so I'm watching a lion attacking wildebeest wildebeest travel in packs in herds the lion sits there you can see it behind the bush because the youtuber shows you where he is he doesn't mess with any of the wildebeest traveling in a pack or in a herd but there's a moment when the wildebeest are crossing the river or one of them inevitably strays off on its own immediately Ryan lines up and it pounces no man left behind has been a United States military protocol from before there were even any official United States we are at war you live we live in enemy territory you have an enemy out there you have an enemy in there the enemy out there has an ally inside of you and inside of me in our own flesh the devil is a roaring lion first Peter 5 8 says seeking someone to devour and let me ask you what I hope is an obvious question who do you think he the devil the roaring lion first targets the man or the woman living their life struggling stumbling falling often but walking side by side with brothers and sisters along the way or the isolated ones the anonymous one the one slipping in and slipping out and avoiding being known at all cost you will stand before God alone each of us will stand before God alone mom or dad will not speak for you the pastor cannot speak for anybody but very few if any will make it there safely before the judgment of God having traveled there alone Christians throughout history have distinguished between the church triumphant and the church militant the church triumphant is what it sounds like it's the church who has triumphed it's those saints who have gone before us and they made it they triumph and so they've entered into their rest they made it by faith and so they are at peace but we my friends on this earth and every Christian on this earth and every church on this earth is what Christians have called throughout history the church militant do you know what that means that means the church at war we are at war not with the white house are you kidding me our enemy is far greater than that seeking souls to devour we are at war i'm not wanting to i want to because i'm not wanting to shame anyone right now i'm wanting to warn everyone and call everyone to seek protection in the God-designed and God-given fortress of the local church she is not this is not a social club or a preaching venue she is this is a worshiping community yes a family yes but also a band of brothers and sisters at war together until glory and Jesus has promised to her that they get in her alone that the gates of Hades shall not stand against her you lock arms you double down with the church and you you might get hurt no you will get hurt we're that messed up you're gonna get hurt at some point if you if you go all in with this you play it safe you stay alone and distant you might not get hurt you might get devoured am i saying you can lose your salvation after all this third point no i'm saying that the church is a body of people who all claim to follow Jesus but i'm saying that some of those people haven't actually been born again because they have not the Holy Spirit and the entire Bible testifies Jesus' own life in his lifetime there were loads of crowds that flocked to follow him yes yes in and then they all fell away same in the church same with Israel for that matter and those people who have not really been born again are incredibly unlikely to make it to the end that's a soul chilling threat but it's a reality and i'm saying that we should all all of us take heed lest we fall don't you ever look away from Christ and don't you ever forsake the means of protection that he has provided for you take refuge with these brothers and sisters and listen if not these brothers and sisters then another gospel preaching church if you want to come up to me or any of our elders and talk about other gospel preaching churches in Loudoun County or email me please come up talk to us email us we'd be happy sad but very glad to send you off safely somewhere else God is way bigger than you ever imagined you and I are way worse off than you ever imagined you Christian have been loved by God for far longer than you ever imagined and you Christian have been secured by blood far more powerful than you ever imagined and you Christian have been conquered by one by words far more powerful than you ever imagined and you Christian will be kept by hands far more powerful than you ever imagined he will hold you fast he will hold me fast he will hold us fast grace began before time grace came into time and took on flesh and lived unto God and obeyed God and died for his people and purchased them by his blood grace came into your life if you're a Christian and called you and called you by the gospel you listened and you obeyed you might not have known why you probably didn't know why but you listened to that charming powerful voice and when you come to the end and close your eyes one last time and fade into the darkness of death and then awake to find yourself before brighter light than you ever imagined possible the blazing light of holiness grace will be there with you then too holding your hand keeping you he will be there he will keep us all if we trust in Christ this is grace amazing grace this is Christ God thank you for grace we understand so little and yet what we see is overwhelming and for all eternity we'll understand more how you've loved us because you've loved us and you've loved us in an unbreakable way and you've kept us you've called us and you will be with us always to the end God anchor our souls and our hearts in your great powerful grace and love God for any who do not yet know you and the saving grace of Jesus we ask and pray that you would call out to them now by your powerful voice and bring them home God we pray for any who are among us who have been around and experienced grace but who have walked away God we pray that you would in your kindness in your mercy we pray that you would call out to them and draw them back into safety again now draw them back to the safety of the savior we pray we pray all these things in Jesus name amen
