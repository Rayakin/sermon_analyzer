The stone on the well's mouth was large, and when all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds rolled the stone from the mouth of the well and watered the sheep, and put the stone back in its place over the mouth of the well. Jacob said to them, my brothers, where do you come from? They said, we are from Haran. He said to them, do you know Laban, the son of Nehar? They said, we know him. He said to them, is he well with him? They said, it is well, and see, Rachel, his daughter, is coming with the sheep. He said, behold, it is still high day. It is not time for the livestock to be gathered together. Water the sheep and go pasture them. But they said, we cannot until all the flocks are gathered together and the stone is rolled from the mouth of the well. Then we watered the sheep. While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she was a shepherdess. Now, as soon as Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban, his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother's brother, Jacob came near and rolled the stone from the well's mouth and watered the flock of Laban, his mother's brother. Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud. And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's kinsman and that he was Rebekah's son. And she ran and told her father. As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister's son, he ran to meet him and embrace him and kiss him and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things. And Laban said to him, surely you are my bone and my flesh. And he stayed with him a month. Then Laban said to Jacob, because you are my kinsman, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be? Now Laban had two daughters. The name of the older was Leah and the name of the younger was Rachel. Leah's eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and appearance. Jacob loved Rachel. And he said, I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter, Rachel. Laban said, it is better that I give her to you than I should give her to any other man. Stay with me. So Jacob served seven years for Rachel and they seemed to him but a few days because of the love he had for her. Then Jacob said to Laban, give me my wife that I may go into her for my time is completed. So Laban gathered together all the people of the place and made a feast. But in the evening, he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob. And he went into her. Laban gave his female servant Zopa to his daughter Leah to be her servant. And in the morning, behold, it was Leah. And Jacob said to Laban, what is this you have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me? Laban said, it is not so done in our country to give the younger before the firstborn. Complete the week of this one and we will give you the other also in return for serving me another seven years. Jacob did so and completed her week. Then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife. Laban gave his female servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel to be her servant. So Jacob went into Rachel also and he loved Rachel more than Leah and served Laban for another seven years. This is the word of the Lord. Have you ever been cheated or lied to? Or have you ever uncovered a massive deception from somebody else in your life? And I want you, as we begin this time looking together at God's word, I want you to remember and think about that feeling you feel when you uncover that somebody's been cheating you, lying to you. Now obviously it makes a difference who that somebody is. There's a large difference between my being lied to by the pizza delivery guy and my wife. And yet is there any more awful feeling in the world than to uncover deception from those who we most trust? Have you ever deceived? Have you ever lied or lived a lie to somebody else? What's the most deceitful thing you've ever done? Can you think of that as we begin this morning? Have you ever been caught in a lie by somebody who trusted you? And can you remember that feeling of being caught and of realizing how badly you've let down that other person who trusted you? If you have a Bible, I wanna invite you to turn with me to Genesis chapter 29. If you're new to the Bible, that is the very first book and a little path halfway through the very first book, Genesis chapter 29. We've been working our way, I've been working my way through Genesis for two and a half years now, only it's taking that long because in large part, I keep taking these intermittent breaks to preach on other things, to preach other books of the Bible and to give you a little pause. And just to catch you up to speed or to remind you since it's been a while or maybe it's your first time and you're just dropping in and we're past halfway through a book, we've really thus far in Genesis been tracing two large and unfolding and overlapping stories through the book of Genesis. Story number one, the story of the seed of the woman. Story number two, big story number two, the story of the blessing of Abraham. Those are the two big, large unfolding stories thus far and throughout the entire book of Genesis. Story number one, sin enters the world as Adam, Eve, the first man, the first woman are placed in a garden, are given one thing, they're forbidden from partaking of, they do that, that's what the Bible calls sin to disobey God and all kinds of havoc is unleashed. The world and their hearts in that moment is changed. God now comes down in judgment in response to their sins and even in the midst of judgment, he strikes a promise that someday, somewhere from this woman and from mankind, a seed is going to be born, a child is going to be born who is going to wage war with that serpent who deceived the man and the woman and with everything evil and unjust in this world, he's gonna wage war, this seed, this son and he's gonna win, he's gonna make everything right. That's story number one, the story of the seed of the woman and it begins all the way back in Genesis 3, verse 15. The second story begins really in Genesis chapter 12 with a new man, a seed of the woman, now generations later, who God is working with and speaking to in a special way and that man is called Abraham. Abraham, God had a very unique and special relationship with God spoke to him as a friend. Abraham is referred to in the Bible as the friend of God and if you can remember, God takes this one man who there was nothing special about him, he was not from the right place, he had not done all the right things and yet God takes this one man and he invites him out beneath the dark canopy of the skies, only this dark night was lit up with millions and millions of stars and he invites, God invites Abraham to look up at those stars and count them if he can and then God strikes three big, resounding, reverberating promises with Abraham. Now if you've been with us for a while and if you can remember back over those two and a half years those three big promises to Abraham were, do you remember, can we do this together? Amen, nothing encouraged, well lots of things encouraged me more but that does encourage me, people, place and blessing. Those are the big three promises God strikes with Abraham, people. He promises to take Abraham and Sarah who are barren and ever getting older and turn them into a nation of people. That will ultimately become the nation that we know as Israel but God promises to take Abraham and turn them into a people. Place, God promises to take Abraham who is a nomad and a stranger in a foreign land and give to him as an inheritance what we know as the promised land. The land of Canaan, the land promised to Abraham and his descendants, it would become to them because of God's promise, home. People, place and finally blessing. Wherever Abraham went, whatever he found himself in the midst of, God promised that he would be with Abraham. He promised Abraham his presence and his presence always implied blessing and ultimately salvation. People, place, blessing and that's where that second story really ties together with that first big story because that blessing promised to Abraham ultimately comes to fruition in that child, that seed to come who will destroy the serpent and all of evil in this world and make things right once more. That's the, if you've missed a lot of time, if you're new to the Bible or if you just needed a refresher, that's the big story and really overlapping stories of Genesis as we come to chapter 29. Now, those two stories have flown and streamed, downstream for a while and tumbled into the person of Jacob. Jacob, if you've forgotten, is the son of Isaac and the grandson of Abraham who had all those promises. Jacob is the second born son, which matters a lot in this story. He comes after Esau, his big brood of an older brother. Jacob, in spite of that, has inherited and not really inherited, he's found his way into his father's birthright, which should have belonged to Esau and he's furthermore found himself and found his way into his father's blessing, neither of which belonged to him by right as the second born son and yet he has them both. Why? All thanks to a special, a very special skill which he seems to have been born with and now has honed, namely Jacob is a master deceiver. He's a liar, a manipulator, he's a cheat. With his mother's help, he has manipulated his brother Esau and then his dying father into giving him his blessing, Isaac's blessing, which is passed down from Abraham, which in this story, I know this is strange to us, but in this story of Genesis and of the Bible, that blessing is everything. Jacob, where we last left off, has that blessing but is on the run, fleeing his murderous brother Esau some 400 miles north from home, headed for Haran, where his mom is from and where his mom still has living ancestors. It's there his father sent him to go and hopefully to find a wife. And finally, one last note where we left off, where we last left this story, in the chapter just before, so Genesis chapter 29, you can look over and see, at the end of the chapter, Jacob had a dream. Do you remember this dream of Jacob in Genesis chapter 28? He lays his head down on a rock for a pillow, he's exhausted and he has a dream and in the dream, he sees a ladder, a ladder reaching all the way from the dirt of this earth to the heavens and on that ladder, he sees angels descending and ascending and at the end of the dream, he sees at the top of the ladder, peering down from heaven, he sees God who speaks to him and reveals himself to be, I am the God of Abraham, your father and I am also the God of Isaac. And then this God of his grandfather looks upon this grandson who is a liar, a cheat and a scoundrel and he strikes those same three blessings of Abraham, now with Jacob, he promises to him, to make him and to turn him into a people and to give him a place and to always bless him and to be with him wherever he goes. Jacob, the lying scoundrel, now has the blessing of Abraham and Jacob, the lying scoundrel, now has Abraham's God as his God. That's a lot but it's important since it's been a while to catch you up to speed. That's where we are as we arrive to Genesis chapter 29 this morning. That's where we pick up the story today and I wanna trace in our time together this morning, just two themes with you from this chapter and these 30 verses, two big themes. If you're a note taker, you can follow along and see where I'm going here. First, I want us to watch together in this first scene, Jacob living under the smile of God, living under the smile of God and then secondly, we're gonna transition to the next scene, the final scene and we're gonna look together at Jacob living under the discipline of God. So living under the smile of God and living under the discipline of God, the first scene we'll look at together is verses one through 14 in your Bible where we find Jacob living under the smile of God. We pick up the story of Genesis and the story of Jacob in verse one, look together with me, chapter 29, verse one, we read, then Jacob went on his journey, so he had the dream, he wakes up the next morning and he goes back on his journey and he came to the land of the people of the east, that is the people beyond and outside of the promised land, not God's people. Verse one contains a really fun and very strange idiom, my translation I just read for you just says, Jacob went on his journey, your translation probably says something similar but the verse more literally translates not Jacob went on his journey but rather and Jacob picked up his feet or his legs and thus came to the land of the people of the east, it's actually the only time in the entire Bible this strange phrase is ever used. This is a month long journey, again some 400, 450 miles away from home and outside of the promised land to Haran, Jacob makes the journey all alone, remember Jacob has been a conniving scoundrel all his life and he's a mama's boy, he's not exactly suited for the wild, the wilderness in a journey like this, Esau is a hunter-gatherer, probably was very familiar with camping, Jacob cooked and if he were alive today no doubt would have played a lot of video games. No offense if that's your thing. Now Jacob's all alone on a treacherous journey constantly looking over his shoulder for being hunted by his brother Esau and yet we read in verse one this strange idiom that after that dream he wakes up and there's a spring in his step. I want you to see this, you watch Jacob in this chapter, something has changed about Jacob. From everything else we've seen of Jacob thus far in the story, something has significantly changed here, there's a renewed vigor to his life, he's left behind his parents' basement and the safety there and now you watch him in this chapter, he's hurling heavy stones and he's running up to a woman he's never met before and planting a kiss on her, this is not the same Jacob we've known all along, what has gotten into Jacob? Inspirational speakers and sort of self-help gurus will tell you that you and I and every single one of us needs to define our why. That got a laugh. And if you, but you get the basic idea, right? Like define, you need to know your why, W-H-Y. So if you wanna get somewhere in life, if you wanna get unstuck in life, you need more than a what, you know? I go to this job, you need a why, you need purpose and I would say, in spite of this laughter from over here, that at least in this one instance, there's lots we can mock about this, just to be clear, you're good, but at least in this one instance, they're not wrong. You do need a purpose, we all need purpose in life, otherwise you're just sort of floating through life, clocking in and clocking out, nine to five, every day you set your alarm clock for another day to do the same thing and you're really, if you think about it, no different from that hamster on that wheel around and around and around and around. You can run pretty far like that and you can go pretty hard, you can achieve lots of things, especially when you're still young and you think you're gonna live forever until someday you wake up, you realize you have no purpose, you have no reason, no why for why you're doing this in the first place and then you wake up finding yourself despairing of life and wondering what the point of it all is, all because you never found a why. Mankind was created for adventure, for a quest, to journey after something. I know how cheesy that sounds, but that's why God made Adam and gave him two legs and lungs to breathe and put him in a garden where there were trees and mountains and predators and snakes and wild animals and gave him a quest to do. You were made for adventure, that's why God gave an opposite sex. It's not just all men, there's not just all women, there's not just androgyny, right? You all need purpose, you men need purpose, you women need purpose, you kids need to find purpose in your life, you need to figure out your why. Mom and dad and teachers are not always gonna be there to say, hey, today, Sonny, it's this, this, and this. Someday, you're gonna have to figure out what this, this, and this is and you're gonna have to figure out why. God means to give you purpose and part of the point of the Bible is God means to define that why for you. Maybe that's the chief difference between what I'm saying and the self-help section. God, the wrong purpose after all is ultimately no better than no purpose, even if it does lead to a much healthier lifestyle. You wanna find out, I wanna find out God's why even more than we wanna find out my why in life. What does God want for me? What is God's purpose for my life? The Bible teaches that you were made for him, meaning you were made to know him and made to journey with him and towards him, to follow him, to obey him on the infinite journey which even surpasses this life until you realize that and set off on that quest. You'll never know what this life is all about. Jacob has discovered God. His father's God, his grandfather's God has finally come and spoken to him. His life looks different now. Suddenly, he's discovered his why as he's discovered the God who made him. Now, I want you to notice everything he does and everywhere he goes, at least in the first scene here, well, it seems like God goes before him. Notice with me, take a look. Look back at the passage. First of all, he comes to a well. Look at verse two. As he looked, he saw a well in the field. Now, this is important. Wells were a really big deal in this ancient, arid culture. I listened to a podcast this week on the history of Las Vegas. I've never been to Vegas. I'm sure many of you have, but it's obviously a major city of cultural significance, for better or for worse, but it's smack in the middle of the Mojave Desert. Have you ever woken up someday to wonder who thought to put a city there? Why is Vegas Vegas? Why is it there? You ever thought about that? I bet a lot of you spent a lot of time thinking about that. Well, I listened to a podcast this week, so I know. To get to Los Angeles, you've got to go through that desert. You've got to go through the Mojave Desert. And right in the middle of that vast desert is a massive system of springs. You want to guess where that massive system of springs is? It's Las Vegas. So back in the day, to get from Salt Lake City, you're a Mormon, you want to go from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles, you got to go through that desert. That became, that system of springs became a significant point of refuge and resting. And those springs turned into a town, and that town turned into a city, and then that city turned into a strip, and now Vegas is Vegas, all because there's water there, and water is life. In this culture, a well is so many things. It is a social hub for gathering information. It's also a source of life. This is a massive well here, which became a hub for all these shepherds you can see east of the Promised Land. Verse two tells us that the well was covered by a great stone, a massive stone, which would have sealed the well and protected it from animal intruders or other things that could contaminate this precious water source. And we read that it was the custom of the shepherds to wait for each other, wait till everybody's there, and then when everybody's there, to remove the stone together, because it was so large and so heavy. Now, earlier in Genesis chapter 24, you might remember, Abraham, Jacob's grandfather, sent his servant to Haran, the same area, to search for a wife for his son Isaac. And the servant arrived, where of all places? To a well, and at that well, he happened upon Rebekah, who ultimately, it was all these remarkable things God was doing, ultimately became Isaac's wife, and now the mother of Jacob, all at a well, which obviously begs the question, is this the same well? And is God at it again? Jacob arrives at a well. Next notice, he discovers that the men there just happen to be where, from all places, from of all places, from where? Haran. Look at verse four. My brothers, where do you come from? And they said, we are from Haran. Now, again, bear in mind, Jacob's on a long, long journey here. He's searching for Haran. There are no signs here. He does not have Google Maps. Imagine his excitement when he discovers that the men he chanced upon here happen to be from where he's going. Oh, he's close. Next notice, he discovers that these men not only are from the right place, they happen to know of Laban, his uncle. Verse four, he said to them, he was just trying his luck here. Do you know Laban? Laban, anybody? The son of Nahor? And they said, yeah, we know him. Laban, Jacob's looking for his uncle, Laban. They know him. He's getting warmer and warmer and warmer. Finally, that very moment, who happens to show up? But Laban's beautiful daughter, Rachel. Look at verse six. He said to them, to the shepherds, Jacob said, is it well with him? Is he alive? Is he healthy? Is he a sane person? Is he safe to be around? Is it well with him? They said, it is well. And look, Rachel, his daughter, is coming now with the sheep. Friends, this is so eerily reminiscent of chapter 24 where Abraham's servant, again, came to the same area, possibly the same well, searching for a wife for Isaac, only to discover that clearly God had arranged everything already for him. It seems like Jacob is walking the same path. Do you see what I'm showing you? He's got a spring in his step. He's got God on his side. And now all of a sudden, it seems like everything is just laid out before him, like the table is already set. Every, you guys have seen those videos? I've seen these recently where it's like a little competition that young people will play, where they'll lay out a path of like boxes. And so there's like six pairs of boxes. And one of the boxes will be full, like a 12 pack of soda. And the other box will be empty and you don't know which is which. And so you have to guess. And if you jump on the box and it deflates, you're out. Do you know this game? The teenagers know what I'm talking about, right? It's like, Jacob's like a man walking here and he just walks random directions and every step he takes, he could fall into a pit, but no, he steps on the box that's full and he reaches his destination. Why? Because God is with him now. Ordering his steps, directing his path, which is exactly, look back at chapter 28, verse 15, which is exactly what God had promised him in that dream where he revealed himself to him. Behold, God says to Jacob, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go and will bring you back to this land for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you. Do you see that's exactly what's unfolding here. God is coming true on that promise. I want you to think about your life and all the different things that have happened along your journey and your path of life. All the things that have brought you here today to whoever you are and to this moment sitting right here with us together. People who were put in your path. I mean, if you're married, think about all the bizarre things that happened to you by chance to bring you to your spouse. The people who were put in your path, the pivotal moments where things could have gone one way, maybe they should have gone wrong, should have gone another way, but it turned out another way somehow at the last second. All the decisions you made, the bad decisions you made, which were somehow seemingly overruled against your will so that you went another way. I'm not saying, I wanna be clear that everything has always worked out for you. I know that it hasn't. And it's not going to for Jacob either for what it's worth, as we're gonna see in just a moment in point two. But can't you see, can't you reflect this morning wherever you're coming from, how so many things, seemingly random things, even accidents and mistakes have ordered your life in such a way that, well, you're here, aren't you? You're here today, you're here this morning, sitting underneath this word, which if this word is what it claims to be, contains the very words of life, even eternal life. Can't you see how God has ordered your steps? That's what Jacob, we're watching Jacob discover here for the first time. It's what, if you remember, Ruth and Naomi discovered together. It's what really so much of the biblical story is about in demonstrating this theme, an invisible sovereign hand ruling, going before us, who's smiling upon us. Jacob's feeling good here. Who wouldn't? Walking beneath the smile of God, having a dialogue here, possibly rude, they're possibly lazy, possibly both. This group of shepherds at the well, he's having a nice little chat with them. And then in the middle of the dialogue, Jacob's words trail off as off in the horizon, he spots the silhouette of Rachel, Laban's daughter, his cousin, biblical times. We don't have pictures or film here. All we know is that Jacob likes what he sees. Now, many will disagree with what I'm about to say, but men are mostly normal human beings until a pretty girl shows up. Then everything gets louder, competition intensifies, showmanship ensues, sideways glances. Did she sit? Because everybody knows that every woman is obviously looking to marry the man who can jump the highest. That's the most suitable spouse. It's honestly, if any of you out there have studied science, men's behavior in this sense is very similar to gorillas or species like that. Look at verse 10. Now, as soon as Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban, his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother's brother, maybe there's still a little bit of a conniving, power-hungry soul in him after all. Sees the sheep of her as well. Jacob came near and rolled that stone from the well's mouth. Do you see? And watered the flock of Laban, his mother. Nevermind all you shepherds. Give me your sheep, Rachel. Let me water them all for you. Jacob waltzes right over to that well and this conniving, cowardly mama's boy manages to remove the stone all on his own. Who knows if this did significant vertebrae damage that he would deal with for the rest of his life. But what we're supposed to see here is obvious, the power of love. You read this, maybe you think it sounds silly, but you all accept the videos of mothers lifting cars to save their little children. The power of love here. Jacob is so stricken by love, we might even say he's so drunk in love in this moment. He dashes from that stone, he throws that stone off and he dashes from that stone to Rachel and plants a kiss on her, verse 11. Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud. There's so much going on right here, just an explosion of bizarre emotions. This is the only time in the entire Bible that any character is recorded to have kissed somebody not his wife or his mother. Only time in the entire biblical story. Now whether it's romantic or familial, carnal or spiritual, it's remarkable. He kisses her and then he just bursts into tears. Verse 12, and Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's kinsman. I mean, we don't know how young she was, how old she was, but she's gotta be just completely caught off guard. And then he announces who he is, he's her father's kinsman, and that he was Rebecca's son. That's her dad's sister, her aunt or aunt. And she ran and told her father. Back in chapter 24, when Abraham sent his servant to find a wife for Isaac, the servant comes to the well, prays the prayer, and then the first woman he sees is beautiful Rebecca. He then covers her, if you remember, he covers her in gold necklaces and fine jewelry. And he tells him his remarkable story of his master sending him and God answering his prayers and shows she, Rebecca, takes all that bling and runs back to her house and she tells her family. And then do you remember Laban, her brother, much younger then, runs back with her. Genesis says, Moses says, seeing all the gold. Runs, he sees an opportunity here, runs out to the servant and invites him very generously. Or is it to stay with the family? Now, all these years later, do you see history is repeating itself? Laban's nephew shows up, Rebecca's son, meets his daughter, also at a well. He takes off running to meet him, verse 13, and as soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister's son, he ran to meet him, only Jacob has no gold. He has nothing really but a camel and a few belongings, maybe a pouch of clothes. The text doesn't say so, but we can imagine Laban's disappointment here. Nevertheless, he welcomes his nephew into his home. Verse 13, we read that he, Laban, embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house. And then Jacob told, I want you to stare at these words in verse 13, Jacob told Laban all these things. Jacob, for a month, the passage says, tells Laban, his uncle, everything. What does everything mean? We don't know, but I take it to mean everything. All these things. He tells him about his life. He tells him about his lies and his manipulation, all from his past. He tells him about his poor blind dad who he cheated. He tells him about his deadly brother who's hunting him. And he tells him about how in spite of all that, he has the blessing now. He tells him everything. He tells him all these things. And verse 14 says, Laban said to him, surely, look at these words, surely you are my bone and my flesh. Now, those words very much reminisce one other scene in the Bible, namely Genesis two, where Adam meets his wife. Who God has crafted for him. And Adam says, at last, and all those animals, the foxes, the giraffes, the snakes, no, no, at last, bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. Laban here, similarly, is ecstatic to meet one like him, his kinsman, his own blood, his estranged nephew. But I want you to see, there are more to Laban's words here, which I think the author of Genesis, Moses, intends us to see. In Jacob, the scoundrel, Laban sees more than a little bit of himself. In Laban, we'll very soon find out, Jacob has met his match, and then some. Aha, my bones and my flesh, a man after my own heart. And thus the first scene ends, with Jacob taking refuge in his uncle's house for a month. Now, that brings us to the second scene, in verses 15 through 30, where things steadily and then severely take a hard turn, as Jacob finds himself now living under the discipline of God. So I wanna shift here to observing Jacob, and think about us, and what it means to live under the discipline of God. The author of Genesis, you see in verse, really from verse 14 to verse 15, the author now moves us a month forward in the story, and Laban comes to Jacob with what seems like a very generous proposition. Verse 15, then Laban said to Jacob, "'Because you are my kinsman, "'should you therefore serve me for nothing? "'Tell me, what shall your wages be?' There's amazing craft behind every single word Laban utters in the entire story. Once you see who he is, everything he says comes to further and really darker light, if I could put it like that. It looks like on the surface, what does it look like? You know, are you gonna work for me? Evidently, Jacob has been working for Laban, he's just joined him in herding sheep or whatever. And Laban comes to him and he says, well, are you gonna work for me for free? Name your wages, what does that look like? It sounds like generosity, doesn't it? But again, once you realize who Laban is and what he is, you see quite clearly that he's looking for an opportunity to extort Jacob and take advantage of him. Some people, and you all know this, some people only see in other people what they can get out of them. And here's what's so difficult and so nasty. These people are often some of the most likable people you'll ever meet, whose words sound the kindest, at least in the short term, because they've become masters of manipulation. They've learned how to use words and gestures and their physical appearance even to exploit people for what they want. Laban is a textbook example here of that sort of person who we've all met. Here after the author from Laban, which turns out to be twisted, after that offer, the author inserts an ominous footnote for you, dear reader. Look at verse 16. Now Laban had two daughters. This is right in the middle of a dialogue, of a business dealing. The author inserts himself. Now Laban had two daughters. The name of the older was Leah and the name of the younger was Rachel. Leah's eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and appearance. And Jacob loved Rachel. This is like when you're watching a show and you're following the plot line and you've got the main characters. And then in a moment, in a scene, some strange character is introduced who introduces some absolutely, some harebrained plot. And you think to yourself, no, they're not gonna do that. That's absurd. But then you have a second thought to yourself, wait a second, Matt, this is television. That's absolutely exactly what's about to happen. Why else would they have showed me that? That's what's happening right here. The author's letting you know something devious is about to happen. Laban has two daughters. Rachel has a sister. Rachel, by the way, can be translated as you, as in a young female lamb. Leah can be translated as cow. You do with that information, whatever you would like to do. A lot of ink has been spilled on the meaning of this strange Hebrew phrase, weak-eyed Leah. For example, a lot of people suggest in the ancient Middle East, the eyes ruled in terms of physical appearance. And so what was most prized was a sparkle in the eye. Maybe that's true, maybe not, but regardless, you all know what this means and you've known it from the first second you've read it. Jacob has eyes for Rachel, not Leah, end of story. Sometimes we don't know what it is. The heart, the eyes want what the eyes want. So here with Jacob, Jacob is not a torn man. He's not divided. He has tunnel vision for Rachel. And so he makes his move with Rachel's father and he says, look at verse 18, and he said, I will serve you seven years for the younger daughter, Rachel. I know this is so strange in our culture, but this is very normal there, except one thing, even culturally, even then, this was a very above and beyond generous offer. This far exceeded any dowry even translated into years of servitude. He's showing how much he values Rachel and he's wanting to make sure he's earned her. Verse 19, Laban says in response, again, watch his words, feel his words. It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to any other man. Stay with me. Again, once you see Laban for the manipulator that he is, everything he says is just teeming with treachery, arrows from his mouth, all dipped in honey. Verse 20 is such a beautiful commentary on the power of love. Women, brace yourselves, ladies, for verse 20. So Jacob, Valentine's Day is coming up. So Jacob served seven years for Rachel and they seemed to him but a few days because of the love he had for her. I remember one time, just briefly, I was engaged to Natalie, my wife now, and there was a complication, a hindrance in our engagement. And so I called my dad and I vented to him and he said, son, just think about Jacob and Rachel. Maybe this is you working seven years for her. Honestly, that's terrible advice, but it was really helpful to me and it meant a lot to me and it really helped to put a wind in my sails. Seven years seemed to Jacob but a few days. Again, this goes back to purpose, doesn't it? To knowing your why. Jacob knows exactly why he wakes up every morning and what he goes to work for for Laban every single day and what he's waiting for for seven years. Every single day, he knows his why until finally in verse 21, the day comes. Look at verse 21, the long-awaited day. Then Jacob said to Laban, all right, give me my wife that I may go into her for my time is completed. I want you to see, I don't know if this is clear as you read this, but the wording here suggests that something is off. There's been a wrench in the play. Jacob has been counting down the days for seven years. Seven times 365, according to my calculator, is 2,555 days. The Jewish calendar, according to Google, is 360 days. So that brings us down to seven times 35, topped off of bottomed out of 2,555. That brings us down to 2,520 days and every last one of them, Jacob has marked off the calendar, 2,519 days left, 999 days left, 200 days left, 99 days left, 11 days left, one day left. He never lost count for a moment, but here we are on victory day and nothing happens. There's no countdown. Maybe he starts to think, oh, they're pulling a big surprise party. There's no surprise party. Laban's busy. Laban forgot. Read Jacob's words again. Give me my wife now that I may go into her for my time is completed. Laban seemingly relents. Verse 22, so Laban gathered together all the people of the place and he made a feast. All right, good, but can't you feel seeing what we've just seen of Laban? Can't you feel the mounting suspense here? Verse 23, but in the evening, Laban took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob and he went into her. Now, when MC read those words, that verse, were we all hearing this for the first time? Like we were, we opened the mailbox and we got Moses' letter, Genesis, and we've never read it before. This didn't happen live, I assume because of familiarity, but were we to read this live, every single other room would've collectively, ah, and behold, he woke up the next morning and it was Leah. I know one of the things you're all asking, hang on a second, seven years, total devoted love, tunnel vision, Jacob didn't know? That's, what? What kind of love is that? How is that even possible? Very briefly, three basic explanations. Darkness, veils, drink. Darkness, there are no lamps. This is the ancient Middle East, a long time ago. It is dark and that means darker than dark. Remember Ruth in the night, scenes like this happen a lot in the Bible and they're much more plausible if you think about when the Bible occurred, darkness. Second, veils. The traditional wedding ceremony involved covering the bride entirely beneath a veil. She was given by the father to the husband, shrouded in a veil and the point was, nobody was to look upon her until she was given to the husband. Thirdly, drink. This is a feast, this is a banquet. Surely there was wine, how much wine? How much did Jacob consume? I don't know, but I do know after seven years of labor, Jacob consummates the marriage and somehow wakes up to find himself having done so with Leah, the older sister. Verse 25, and in the morning behold, it was Leah. It is so hard to imagine Jacob's horror here, especially when you consider in this culture, there is no undoing what's been done. This is final. And Jacob said to Laban, what is this you have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Now watch these words. Why then have you deceived me? Now hold on a second. What did you just say, Jacob? Why then have you deceived me? There's no other moment in the entire Bible more pregnant with irony than this one. Think about it, the chapter before, Jacob dressed up as Esau, put on animal skins, came to his blind and dying father who touched him, smelled him, and in his confusion gave him the blessing, believing he was giving it to Esau. Now Jacob is blinded himself by darkness or by the drink or by both and mistakenly marries Leah. Jacob is, think about it, Jacob is the younger brother who cheated his older brother out of his birthright and then his blessing. Now Jacob has eyes for the younger sister, but a wall now stands between him and the younger one he desires, and the wall is the older sister. Then Jacob, the deceiver, with blood boiling, looks at his awful uncle and says, why then have you deceived me? Do you feel the irony behind his words? Laban's response is amazing. I mean, think about it, Laban has just been caught in an awful, unconscionable deceit. This is the sort of stunt you pull when you're on the way out of town in the night and you never have to see that person again, yet Laban looks him right in the eyes and shamelessly says, verse 26, Laban said, it is not so done in our country to give the younger before the firstborn, he would have made a spectacular presidential candidate, Laban would have. Not in my notes, totally gonna get bad feedback on that one. Flashback, seven years before, do you remember? One month, for one month, Jacob told Laban everything. All his past, all the sins, everything he'd done to Esau, everything he'd done to his father, all his lies, which had led to his flight, which has led to him coming in desperation to Laban, and now Laban, the arch deceiver, takes Jacob's past, crafts his word, and twists the knife. It is not done so in our country, hear this, to give the younger before the firstborn. Jacob has finally met his match, my bone and my flesh indeed, and the deceiver has been deceived. No words are recorded of Jacob in response to his uncle here, surely he's silent, surely he realizes in this moment exactly what's going on with Laban, even more perhaps what's going on with God, as now finally his sins have caught up to him. Genesis 29 is, like so many chapters in Genesis, is so jarring that it's almost disorienting. You read all of part one, Jacob's met God, and everything just works out his way. It's a new day for Jacob, a new way of life, he can't make a wrong move, is there a spring in his step? It looks like he's just gonna bankroll his way straight to God in heaven. Part two, at the climactic moment, the wedding feast, everything's so great, all of Jacob's past skeletons all at once return to haunt him. All of Jacob's past skeletons all at once return to haunt him, and his life becomes complicated in the worst kind of way, you ever felt like that? Like, yes, yes, like, okay, God, I got God now, I'm with you, yes, God, smile, yes, oh no. Everything from a past has come back. But here's what I want you to see as we begin to wrap up. The same God is behind both of these scenes. As the artist, and even as the director of all of Jacob's story, part one was not a mirage. God really was with Jacob, really was directing his steps, really was smiling upon him. Part two was not abandonment. God was still with Jacob, and Jacob was going to need to learn to believe that and to rely upon God in this circumstance in a very new kind of way, as all his new roses turned to thorns. Hebrews 12, you don't have to turn there, but at the end of the Bible in the New Testament, Hebrews 12 teaches us about the loving discipline of God. The author says that God's discipline is an expression of a father's love for his children. Hebrews 12, six, for the Lord disciplines the one he loves. God is treating you as sons, as daughters, for what son is there whom his father does not discipline? We know this as parents, you know, and eventually we figure it out, even as children, if we don't like it in the moment, we know that the very worst thing you can do is to just ignore or give in to a wayward child. If you don't correct a child, they will destroy themselves. It's loving the discipline, and it's exactly the same, Hebrews is saying, with God. The author knows how painful it is in the moment to experience God's discipline. And so he reminds us of what it's producing in its long-term, Hebrews 12, 11, for the moment, in the moment, all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it. And so the author concludes in Hebrews, the section on discipline by calling us, us who are under God's discipline, now or later, to see it for the loving kindness and tender care of God that it is. He says, therefore, lift up your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees. Stand up, look up, eyes up, and make straight paths for your feet so that what is lame may not be put out of joint, but rather be healed. God is healing you, he says. See it for what it is. Listen, Jacob has been a scoundrel his entire life, and yet through his deceit, he got the blessing. That's the scandal of Genesis. Again and again and again. God keeps choosing, keeps blessing the losers, the cheaters, the scoundrels. Now, in a sense, as Christians, we delight in that. I see some smiles even right now. We love that because we know that means we've got a chance. Grace, yeah? But there's another side to the story of grace, which we're seeing this morning in the discipline of God. You see, Jacob has not just gotten away with all his sins from all his past, and he cannot outrun them forever. They catch up to him in his dirty Uncle Laban, who I believe God uses, not to retaliate. That's not the point. Now he's gonna punish Jacob, so just in case he thought he got away with him. That's not the point, but to discipline Jacob as his son, to make him into all that God means for him to be. Some of us, some of you, are here this morning. It may be you are experiencing, even now, the loving discipline of God. Our sins are forgiven the moment we trust in Christ and take him as Savior and King, and yet there are consequences in this life for our sins. And if that is you, and if you are a Christian, and it will be true of you, whether it's true right now if you're a Christian, or it will be true tomorrow, or in a month, or in a year, we all are meant by God to experience his loving discipline. Let me give you two words of encouragement, if that's you today or for when that's you tomorrow. First of all, see it for what it is, the loving kindness of God, your Father. God loves you like a son, like a daughter. That is entirely why he disciplines us. There are no mixed motives in God. Yeah, I wanna teach him a helpful lesson. Also, I wanna get back at him a little bit. That's not how God works. He's entirely motivated by love to help you. For him to leave you alone in your sins would be the most destructive thing in the world for you or me, do you see that? That's actually where the real danger lies. You're here this morning cold and calloused in your sins. You are the one who should fear and tremble, not the one who's being disciplined by God. To be left alone by God in our sins, that's death. Secondly, I wanna encourage you, you don't need to walk through that alone. Today or tomorrow, the local church is given by God for you to walk with you. All we are is a group of people, the local church, all we are is a group of people from one angle who have agreed, yeah, we're sinners too, looking for a savior, sign me up. What Laban did here to Jacob, learning of all his past sins and then using it in time against him is the anti-type of what a church is to be and how church members are to be towards one another. That's not what we do with each other's sins. And that is true because Jesus, the head of this body, the captain of this ship, touched lepers. And welcomed prostitutes. And befriended himself liars and cheaters and scoundrels and then died for them all. Now, we don't do that perfectly. Full disclosure and advertisement to those of you on the fence right now with what I'm saying. Sometimes we do fail and we will fail. But that's what we're trying to do as we follow his lead. So let us walk with you and help us to grow into a place where it's more and more normal to share our struggles, to be humble and humble and humble. And to be open to sharing the good news. And to not be afraid and not to hide them. So many people come to church and they come to church and they just resurrect walls and they put up guardrails. And there's lots of reasons for this. They've been burned before when they tried to do what I just told you to do. And they got burned by it. Or maybe they assumed that whatever their skeletons are, they're the only one. Even if there's no other in your life where you don't have to do that, where you don't have to pretend, where you don't have to hide. In fact, if I could say this, the one category of persons who are disqualified, not by me, not by this church, disqualified by God from this salvation are those who perpetually pretend that they are okay or even convince themselves that they are good enough. No, the son of God did not become man and die for people who were good enough. Die for other people besides you. Die to give you a little boost because you're already pretty good and you're on your way and you just need one little extra boost in his death and blood. No, he dies for sinners and only for sinners. That's the only qualification here, to know and to own that you're a sinner. And so you look for a savior. So if you're here this morning and you're wondering what Christianity is all about and you're thinking it's a bunch of people who've got it all together, that's entirely not the point. It's a bunch of people who have agreed together. No, we've all messed up. We've all fallen short of the glory of God. That's why we're looking to Jesus. One of my favorite things that we do again and again, just a weird thing that Christians do that doesn't happen in a lot of other circles outside of like recovery type situations is we share testimonies and they're all different. They're all unique. They're also all the same. Have you ever thought about that? Hi, I'm such and such. And this is the scoundrel that I used to be. And I'm gonna tell you five reasons why you should actually never trust me. But that's actually what brought me to the point of ceasing to trust myself so that I looked to God and looked to Christ and began to trust him. So here I am and we all cheer. Yes, another liar, cheater, in, they're in, take them in, come on. That's the point of the gospel and of the local church community. Nobody's, we clap and we hug over another liar. The passage ends and we'll pick up next week with one man taking two sisters, both to be his wife. What could go wrong? I don't know how you think I meant that, but some of the, I meant it in the best kind of way. Come back next week and we'll watch everything go wrong once again and then God make everything right once again. Let me pray. God, we thank you for the wonders of grace. God, help us to never grow accustomed to the scandal of grace. And God, help us to receive your loving discipline as grace as well, as further grace upon grace. We pray you would help us in Jesus' name, amen.
