The sermon passage for today can be found on page 986 in the Blue Bibles. It's 1st Thessalonians 2 1 through 12 For you yourselves know brothers that are coming to you was not in vain But though we had already suffered and been shamefully treated at Philippi as you know We had boldness and our God to declare to you the gospel of God in midst of much conflict For our appeal does not spring from error or impurity or any attempt to deceive But just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel So we speak not to please man but to please God who tests our hearts For we never came with words of flattery as you know, nor with a pretext for greed God is witness nor did we seek glory from people whether from you or from others though We could have made demands as Apostles of Christ But we were gentle among you like a nursing mother taking care of her own children So being affectionately desirous of you, we were ready to share with you. Not only the gospel of God But also our own selves because you had become very dear to us for you Remember brothers our labor and toil we worked night and day that we might not be a burden to any of you Well, we proclaim to you the gospel of God Your witnesses and God also how holy and righteous and blameless was our conduct towards you believers for you now No How like a father with his children? We exhorted each of you and encouraged you and charged you to walk in a manner worthy of God Who calls you into his own kingdom and glory? If you're if you're growing up was or is anything like mine Then your daily experience Wasn't your parents continually telling you lots and lots of new things so new instruction Comes occasionally as necessary for the but for the most part once you hit a certain age You've kind of already learned the basic necessities of survival in your household from then on for the most part It's mostly reminder It was your parents telling you a lot of stuff that you already knew and this is not Contrary to what maybe you have thought or did think or do think because your parents are being difficult. It was on the contrary because We people every single one of us were prone to forget So you get reminders? You know, you need to clean your room. You know, you need to take out the trash You know, you need to close that door so parents, maybe maybe you're on the other side of that now and Maybe as you think about it, you notice how much of your parenting would you say is Telling your kids something new versus telling them what you know, they already know Like much of life what we see in the Bible is that much of gospel ministry is Telling Christians what they already know Much of gospel ministry is very simply reminder and Doesn't seem like this is a bad thing. I think this is what we have going on here in 1st Thessalonians chapter 2 Paul spends a whole chapter in reminder mode So Paul tells the church here in this chapter Four times over that he knows that what he's telling them is stuff that they already know look there in verse 1 He starts off. He says, you know Verse 2 he says it again, you know down in verse 9. He says you remember verse 11 He says it again, you know, these are things that they already know evidently Paul saw that there was need for reminder in the church But reminder for what? Exactly, and why why would he spend? 12 verses Telling them what they already know Maybe think about these two questions as we jump in. So first off What is the reminder that Paul is giving them? It seems to me the reminder that Paul's giving them is very simply that the church can trust Paul's words about the gospel That's what he's saying. Let me remind you you can trust what I've said So Paul senses a need to remind the church in Thessalonica that he and the other Apostles with whom he's done ministry in that city They're the real deal They can be trusted We can see this in the way that he reminds them of the the fruit of their ministry see that in verse 1 You yourselves know brothers that are coming to you was not in vain So we didn't come to you and preach and it come up empty. It came up fruitful. That's what happened among you You need to remember this We see it in in the rest of the passage We'll get into it in a minute how he reminds them of his motives in ministry. He goes into this a lot He says the source of our ministry it didn't spring up from all these false things It sprung up from genuine concern for you. We can see it how he reminds the church of his methods in ministry So the way we've gone about remind ministry, he reminds them, you know, how we went about ministry among you, you know, you know So first Thessalonians 2 it's an apologetic for it's it's a it's a defense for Paul's apostolic ministry Chapter 2 is Paul looking at the church and reminding them saying you can you can trust me you can trust us But why is he saying this so so why this reminder why first Thessalonians 2 In short they and we will at some point in some way We will be tempted to forget that we can trust Paul's words about the gospel So we don't we don't know exactly What it was about the situation in Thessalonica that necessitated all this reminding from Paul. So unlike other Situations the book of Acts doesn't tell us of any existential threat going on to the church in Thessalonica The rest of this letter it's it's it's not like Paul's letter to the Corinthians where there were obvious kind of on the ground threats to the gospel in this church But what we do know from Acts and from this letter is that there was still a big problem and the problem here is That Paul is not able to be physically present with the Thessalonians He had been there But as he's writing he's not Which means as we saw last week This church is in a particularly vulnerable Unprotected position So Mike Jones will really get into more of this next week at the end of chapter 2 and of in the chapter 3 into chapter 3 But think about their situation so Outside what we know from the book of Acts is it is the Apostles only spent a few weeks? With the church in Thessalonica. So outside of a few weeks that they had with Paul and Silas This is a church that has never seen the gospel lived out They have never seen an extended season of faithful gospel ministry Which means that this church is a church which could be especially susceptible to counterfeits counterfeit preachers counterfeit ministries counterfeit Gospels if they were to come along So in this letter Paul seems a bit anxious anxious that maybe some charlatans are gonna come along in Thessalonica Maybe even in the name of Christ, maybe even looking a lot like the Apostle Paul but with completely different motives completely different methods and maybe even a completely different message and Paul as he's writing he just can't stomach that so remember from last week One of Paul's emphases was that this is a church who received the gospel in the best way that any church can receive the gospel We saw this at the beginning of chapter 1 we see it in the next verses of chapter 2 Verses 13 through 16 and he just can't stomach the thought of this church Which has begun so well being drawn away by smooth talk or slick methods of others who may come along with really bad motives So what so what could Paul possibly do being away from them? So, how could Paul from a distance? How could he get ahead of the threat of false teachers and false Gospels? What could Paul say that would add lasting weight lasting validity? To the message that they've heard what could Paul remind them of that would confirm that he himself is the real-deal Apostle that his ministry that his message is true Well before we get into what Paul says we should ask So so I wonder with you. How do you know if someone's ministry is legitimate? How can you tell That the ministry that someone is preaching is true. I Think I think many of us would go to things like well, their theology is Orthodox Or we'd say they're they're very obviously gifted teaching Or we say well, I listen to them in their arguments. They're airtight what they say. It's uncontrovertible and These things are good and true Or could be good and true But what about Paul what does what does he say so here is Paul Writing to this beloved church with an aim to convince them that they can trust that the message he's delivered to them is true He wants them to be rooted and established in the one true gospel. So so to what does he appeal? What does he remind them of does he does he tell him of his training? Remember how I was trained in the gospel does he tell him of his gifts? Does he tell him of his acumen? Does he remind them of the airtight arguments that he had while he was among them? Well At least here no, it's none of these things Instead Paul makes the argument that the church in Thessalonica that this church in northern Virginia we can trust the message Because it's been validated by his character his character Look at verse 10 of chapter 2 you are witnesses Paul says and God also How holy and righteous and blameless was our conduct to you believers Paul is telling us that the thing that authenticates the truthfulness of the Christian message is the Christian character of the one giving it At least in this case. I Think this is worth us thinking about so So think about your own life Think of the people in your life by whom you have been or are being theologically Spiritually morally formed And here's the question do you know their character? So so maybe they know a lot of theology maybe they have airtight arguments for the faith, but are they godly Does their life match the message? So, I know there are I know there are books there's the internet all of that It's not realistic for us to personally know every person from whom we learn about the faith but if first Thessalonians 2 teaches us anything, it's that we got to have a category for the fact that character matters in Christian leaders as Believers we must care about the character of the people to whom we're entrusting our spiritual formation It is biblically required that the life of a true pastor a true spiritual leader match the content of the true gospel a Person's life their ministry their motives their methods. They must commend the gospel or they're not the real thing This is what makes them worthy of trust in what it's what makes the gospel very practically Acceptable that is it makes people able to receive the gospel So just think about it how many how many people are currently Deconstructing the entirety of their belief system because the person who taught it to them turned out to be morally bankrupt This is why Paul at least here in this letter as he seeks to authenticate the trustworthiness of his message He reminds the church here not of his theology his training his giftedness He reminds the church of his character about about the fact that he himself has commended the message with his own life Listen what he says there in verses 3 through 6. So here you'll notice as we read it He uses the word not a lot, right? So basically here in verses 3 through 6 Paul is giving us kind of the photo negative of gospel ministry Right if you want to see what it's not then we can look at these knots right look at verse 3 He says our appeal does not spring from error or impurity or any attempt to deceive All right Paul's drawing up drawing our attention to the fact that the reason why someone enters into and carries on in the ministry it totally matters It does matter So we've got to be aware as the church We've got to be aware of the fact that just because someone has a title or position or a following or a platform None of this in itself means that they're actually seeking the good of the people To whom they're supposedly ministry What we learn from this photo negative of gospel ministry is that it's totally possible for someone to be in quote-unquote Christian ministry with very un-christian motives What could this look like how would we tell he goes on look back in verse 3 through 6 He says our appeal does not spring from error or impurity or any attempt to deceive But just as we've been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel So we speak not to please man, but to please God who tests our hearts For we never came with words of flattery as you know, nor the pretext for greed. God is witness Nor did we seek glory from people whether from you or from others though? We could have made demands as apostles of Christ Paul Paul says that he himself he never came with impure deceitful motives But it brings up the question if someone did someone did come to the church with impure deceitful motives, what would that look like? What are some impure motives? Which if combined with some sense of gifting could land someone in a in a position in ministry a platform in Ministry It seems like one of the things that he's describing is it's something like vanity or pride Maybe we call it vain glory So verses 4 verses 6 Paul speaks very plainly of the fact that there will be some spiritual leaders Who are in it because they love the praise of men They love to please people There will be people in ministry who love to be in ministry because they love to be in front of people and tell people what Their flesh wants to hear So listen, I just encourage you as a as kind of a point of application If you find yourself listening to a teacher who always tells you what your flesh wants to hear. Maybe that's a red flag This Paul says is called flattery It's flattery flattery is when you you construct words to gratify someone's vanity to scratch What their itches what their ears itch for so flattery Flattery does this in a ministry it it seeks to understand what people need to hear in order to feel good about themselves or to or to kind of bolster the positions that they've already come to and Then it proceeds to heap on words that would affirm that And this is why flattery and the gospel are diametrically opposed They're oil and water Because you cannot simultaneously Indulge someone's vanity and at the same time confront their sin and tell them of a need to be saved from their sin There are people we got to know there are people who make a living there are people who make a killing Putting on a hat of spiritual or political or social authority and telling a certain subset of people exactly what they want to hear and This may be entertaining. It may be satisfying but it's not ministry It's vanity It's flattery This is one reason why or a path that a false teacher may find themselves in a position of authority Another is greed Paul flags this in verse 5 He says for we never came with words of flattery as you know, nor the pretext for greed God is witness Why do false teachers target Christians, why do they target the church because there's money to be made there So in the New Testament context including here in these early churches It was totally possible and normal and expected that self-appointed apostles would come through a city and pray on believers They would they would take hospitality. They would take money. They would they would assume some point of status. They would accumulate wealth and This is why if you think about it in context This is why Paul was so adamant that even though he would have been well within his apostolic rights To make a living off his preaching of the gospel. He says that's good and right. I should do that I could do that. He refused to do so in certain places like Thessalonica. Why? Why why did he choose a man who was totally gifted especially called Why did he choose not to make his living off the preaching of the gospel? It was that he wanted to make sure that people knew that the purity of his motives in that early church He was self-supported in these areas. He took not a dime from these churches to whom he was ministering For the sake of the reception of the gospel message He refused to be lumped into into that group of preachers who preached for a false gospel for greedy gain He wanted to be able to look back on his ministry which he could and say I came to you and I took not a dime I gave you only the pure gospel. You need to remember that so Paul wants the church. He wants us to know There are people who put themselves out there as ministry leaders who are greedy for gain It's not this isn't difficult to do is it especially today with all the platforms that are possible You can write a book that scratches an itch you get a go on a conference tour you start a YouTube channel Whatever it is possibilities are endless. There's a lot to be gained in a platform of ministry The question is worth pondering So listen, if you if you're maybe if you're if you think of the people you follow if you're following a popular Maybe a controversial public influencer. It's not it's not crazy every now and then hit pause and just ask All right. What is this person set to gain from this platform? Might be a helpful question The question for us I think in light of what Paul is saying here is are we being watchful as Individuals as the church are we being watchful? So I'm not paranoid right? We're not looking for the devil under every rock But are we being watchful? Are we being discerning? Do we have a category for the fact that there are some people who use the name of Christ For vain vanity for for greed as a means of gain Do we have a category, you know Paul uses the word deceit To say that to say that some people set out with the seat it it inherently means it kind of has within it the the The truth that it's gonna be the false Gospels are sometimes gonna be hard to detect. It's deceitful It'll sound good it'd be hard to discern So It's just helpful for us to know false doctrine has no camp, right? It's a chameleon It'll change itself to look and feel good to to whatever way we define good Are we watchful? This is the this is the photo negative of gospel ministry. Paul wants us to be aware of it But if this is the if this is the photo negative then what is the real picture so what's the what's the alternative To a ministry of flattery and vanity and greed and if Paul was not among them If he wasn't among Apostles who operated like that with those motivations with those methods, then what was he like? Look at verse 3 again He says our appeal does not spring from error or impurity or any attempt to deceive But just as we've just as we've been approved by God being trusted with the gospel So we speak not to please man, but to please God who tests our hearts All right, so So why was Paul not deceitful? Why was he not vain or or greedy for gain in his ministry? Why could the church? Why can we trust Paul? He says one thing is because his was not a ministry of flattery rather it was a ministry of stewardship You see that in verse 4 So what Paul had The gospel it did not come from him It was not his so the gospel of salvation in Christ. It belongs to God and in God's providence God had given he had entrusted this gospel to Paul Paul had not come up with a solution to people's problems, which he was now peddling on Shark Tank, right? No, Paul had been given something He'd been entrusted with something and he had zero ownership permission to alter it or to barter with it The gospel which belongs to God which has been eternally decreed by the Father Son and Spirit Has been entrusted to Paul his role now is what what's a true minister of the gospel? It's a steward His role was faithful stewardship not vanity not greed not flattery stewardship This is the real thing. This is the real ministry ministry is stewardship of the gospel And His point with the Thessalonians need to remember is That he was stewarding it. So very carefully he was while he was among them He was seeking to commend the gospel in every way by his motives and his methods And he's saying listen if you look back on this if you remember this if you cling to this Then you'll also remember against any other counterfeit minister or message You'll remember that what I said was true then you can cling to it even when I'm gone It's really interesting that this is a this is a letter which unlike other letters Paul Demands actually at the if you go to the end of the book chapter 5 verse 27 He demands that this letter be read in front of all the other members of the church He says I put you under oath before the Lord that this letter be read with all the other brothers Why is this why would he be so emphatic? Because then and now Paul knows that opposition to the gospel to the one true message. It's going to come So because of sin because of the flesh because of the world because of the devil We are going to encounter messages that tempt us to question what's been handed down to us by the Apostles I'm assuming that this has happened to us this week. Has anybody experienced that even this week? Anyone in light of the current cultural climate Have you been tempted to maybe rethink or maybe rework the message that the church has heard for the last 2,000 years? It's been handed down from the Apostles I'm sure we have The temptation is there it's real But here's the message Paul is giving here We the church you church We can take Paul at his word You can take Paul at his word You see what he's saying his preaching did not stem from error he was not wrong It was not diluted by his personal impurity or deceitful methods or ends Paul's is a message which has not been contaminated by sketchy motives He was not manipulated or motivated by by greed or the praise of men Paul's message as preached in his day as preserved in our day. It's true It's undiluted truth so listen when Paul says There's a lot of our New Testament, right? all these letters written by the Apostle Paul inspired by the Holy Spirit written through him and When he says here in other letters that Jesus is the eternal Son of God we can take him at his word. It's true When he says that Jesus humbled himself took on the form of man. He's not lying When Paul says that Jesus lived a life completely without sin That Jesus allowed himself to be crucified and at the whole point of the crucifixion was that Jesus was taking on him on Himself a curse for sin that hung over all people When Paul says that Jesus died for sinners To bring us back to God when he says that Jesus rose from the dead and that he was glorified and then he's coming back for us and we'll live with Him in glory forever and listen when Paul says when he says that there's a certain way to live life, which has boundaries And those boundaries are actually freedom their freedom from the sin to which we were once enslaved When Paul says all these things things on which we bet our lives things on which we bet our eternity The point is this he is not lying This is the message that he received from God himself This is the message that he bolstered by his own life That he commended by his own way of life among among the church in Thessalonica, and he's telling the truth Paul was not spouting some man-made message for greedy gain or self-promotion when Paul said all these things in Thessalonica when we read them in our Bibles, we must know we can believe that they're true It's true The message that we've received The message that you've received Christian the message on which you've banked your entire eternity is true You're not the crazy one it's kind of the message of the New Testament Listen, when you you're not crazy for believing in the incarnation. You are not crazy for believing in the crucifixion You're not crazy for believing the ascension. You're not crazy for believing in the second coming You're not crazy for believing that when Jesus offered up his life for sin That that was the payment for your sin that you've been redeemed by that blood That's true That's the message that's been handed down to us and it's true you can believe it you believe it now and you'll see it later So Paul sought you see what he's doing here He's he sought to live his whole life his whole ministry in a way that commends that message He takes so much care in his character and his motivation all these things to be to commend This this amazing message and that's what he wants them to remember, you know, you know, you remember, you know And that's why here in chapter 2 we have not only the photo negative we also have the picture itself of true gospel ministry So we spend our time so far. We're seeing seeing what ministry must not be We'll we'll round it out for these last few minutes to think about the real thing so what What does faithful gospel ministry? What is faithful gospel stewardship look like? How would we know it? How would we tell? Once we've seen the real thing Is anybody ever worked as a bank teller anybody here? I never have I have friends who have they and that one of the jobs of bank tellers to tell is to be able to recognize counterfeit currency and And the main way you recognize the counterfeit is that you study the real thing You know the ins and outs of the real thing I think this is has to be true of the church with the gospel and I think it has to be true with with Gospel ministry. We need to know what the real thing is so that we can recognize a counterfeit Thankfully we have a good picture of that here All right. So what is faithful gospel? Stewardship and faithful gospel ministry look like ministry that commends the message. There's a lot here. I want to see four things though four things Number one true gospel ministry is courageous a Counterfeit ministry sets out for personal gain But true ministry sets out for and is ready for personal loss. It's courageous Look at look back in verse 2 Paul says but though we had already suffered and been shamefully treated at Philippi is as you know We had boldness in our God to declare to you the gospel of God in the midst of much conflict Philippi the What happened in Philippi was completely embarrassing. It was shaming for the Apostles. They'd been they've been singled out. They've been stripped They've been beaten. They've been imprisoned all these things They knew that when they moved on to another town This was likely what was gonna happen and Paul says, you know what happened? And you know that when we came to you, you know exactly what we did We held up the gospel to you just like we're called to do You know again By means of application. I think a good question I think a good question to ask concerning the people that that we listen to that we follow You know, it's a good question is not only what this person is set to gain by the their ministry Maybe another good question is what this person is willing to lose because of their ministry Gospel ministry is courageous counts the costs and it steps forward a Second thing true gospel ministry is tested It's tested like verse 4 but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel So we speak Not to please man, but to please God who tests our hearts Paul Paul wants to make it make it really clear that he's not just some guy who has a sense that he's God's man Right, so Paul knew through personal experience he knew through inward conviction He knew through outward validation that he had been chosen and approved and set apart as God's messenger This is why when he when he writes and he strokes other churches who are selecting leaders. He asked them to do what? He asked them to examine those who would be their leaders their pastors Test them test their character test their gifts only after they pass these tests. Should they should they be listened to as spiritual authorities? It's in this light that Paul's holding out his own life example to them when he's seeking to come in the message of the gospel Verse 4 he says it right there. We have been approved by God who tests the hearts Paul knows He has two witnesses to his character He has the church itself who can see the outward ministry and he has God himself who sees his heart God tests us verse 10 you are witnesses and God also how holy and righteous and blameless our conduct toward you believers Obviously obviously the Lord has no perfect servants holding out the gospel here on earth. It's not what we're saying What we are saying is that is that the Lord does require legitimate godliness in his servants We read the qualification for elders earlier on in the service, right? What are they with the exception of being gifted to teach? What are they? but character qualifications What a Christian should be an elder is he must be and Again in our in our time of kind of unprecedented access to teachers write books blogs online, whatever it is The point is Listen before we go kind of making life-altering decisions based on what some of these popular popular teachers say It'd probably wise to ask By whom has this person been approved? What tests of character has this person passed is he godly how would I know a True gospel minister is one tested and proven and approved not only in gifting but in character And what's this what does this character look like I think we see this in Paul's next point number three True gospel ministry is motherly True gospel ministry is motherly look at verse 7 But we were gentle among you like a nursing mother taking care of her own children All right, Paul would have us to pause and imagine for just a moment imagine a mother Holding caring for her newborn baby. So have that picture in your mind, right? What must be true of that mother? She must be patient Right. She's no she must know that she's gonna get spit up on right that there's gonna be irrational crying and complaining And complaining she must be calm right she is the one in this relationship who brings the emotional temperature down She must be present she's with the child it's no good being apart She cannot be rough With this child she risks actually legitimately hurting the baby It does no good for this mother with her position of authority to throw her weight around with an infant But she loves this child so she's gentle with it in this Paul says That's gospel ministry You know, it's not uncommon for us to Think about the reality that that motherhood is ministry, which it is But we rarely think about the reality that for true gospel leaders Ministry is actually motherhood It's gently it's patiently it's calmly it's lovingly caring for spiritual children This is ministry There is an appropriately maternal nature to true gospel ministry. It's not severe. It's not harsh It's not hard. It's not dunking on people on the internet. It's not owning people It's tender. It's warm Look what he says in verse 8 So being affectionately desirous of you We were ready to share with you not only the gospel of God, but also our own selves because you had become very dear to us Ministry being maternal Means that there's an inherent self giving there's a there's a sacrificial element to ministry, right? So again, think of that mother with her newborn baby All right mother and baby they're together now which one of those Which one of those two people in that situation is required to give themselves away for the other? Who who's required to do the sacrificing who's the giver who's the one giving literally themself away to the other It's the mother, isn't it? And Paul says in gospel ministry It's the leader. It's the minister This is how you know He's the real thing The leader is not there for selfish gain. He's not there for accolades. He's not there for promotion the leader is there to care for to tend to to nurture to protect and he does this by giving his own life a Mother's life a Mother's life is a continual giving of herself away to her child And Paul says this is what gospel ministry is. It's how you know, it's real so Listen as you as you choose who to follow in your Christian life as you choose your pastors as you choose your other spiritual mentors your influences It's probably wise to ask do they pass the maternal test Are they gentle with people or do they tend to speak and act harshly are they patient or do they seek to intimidate a Leader who throws their weight around like a bull no matter how theologically sound they are is not doing true gospel ministry and Following such a person When you hit your wagon to that train It's it's dangerous to your own spiritual health The manner in which gospel ministry is conducted it matters It matters in a true gospel minister, according to Paul is gentle among people like a mother with her own kids, it's a picture All right fourth and and finally a True gospel ministry is fatherly The true gospel ministry is fatherly look at verse 11 and 12 For you know how like a father with his children We exhorted each one of you and encourage you and charge you to walk in a manner worthy of God Who calls you into his own kingdom and glory? All right. So what we're saying true true gospel ministry. It's both maternal and paternal, right? It's motherly and fatherly and this makes sense Because God himself who is a father is figured as both paternal and maternal in the Old Testament Isaiah 66 13 he compares himself as one whom his mother comforts So I will comfort you you shall be comforted in Jerusalem Psalm 103 as a father shows compassion his children. So the Lord shows compassion to those who fear him God God dearly loves his children. This is the theme of the service This is the story of the Bible and in that love he comforts his children like a mother and he has compassion on them like a father and what Paul is saying is That these same character rest characteristics must be true of those who've been called to represent Christ here on earth as spiritual authorities in the church a Pastor commends. He authenticates the gospel of God to his people by the obviously imperfect But legitimately earnest way that he seeks to parent them in the gospel maternally and paternally For you know, he says how like a father with his children. We exhorted each one of you Encourage you and charge you to walk in a manner worthy of God who calls you into his own kingdom and glory in glory Maternally a pastor will be gentle will be caring Paternally a pastor will be encouraging and comforting. He's one who spurs us on to keep going in the faith when we're tempted not to There's just love what Paul assumes will be true of a pastor of people who are appropriately fatherly It's just amazing. So in this kind of ministry, there will be Exhortation and encouragement, right? So those two two words there in verses in verse 12 The two words are basically kind of conveying conveying the same idea encouragement comfort assurance So the picture of a fatherly gospel ministry is one which will in which encouraging words will be the norm This is just what's happening in a in a fatherly ministry encouragement exhortation care I Wonder I wonder can you think of the last time someone took the time to say something specifically encouraging to you? Maybe you can't But maybe you can What's the effect of genuine encouragement? It's it's wind in the sails, isn't it? It's it's breath for your spiritual lungs that when you're breathing feel shallow Encouragement is meant to be such a gift found within the church yet. Does anything come less easily to natural man than encouragement? Think there are just so many things that stand in the way of encouragement aren't there? pride Maybe just the fact that we're actually blind to good things and other people Self-centeredness jealousy conceit Listen here's an application for you. Here's a to-do for you. Would you do this? Would you would you think and would you just would you think about spiritual life that you see in the church? Would you make note of it and would you verbalize it to someone? Make note to encourage someone in the church So according to according to this passage leaders ought to be setting the pace in this Right. So pray that we would But also you make a note Think of something that's true of someone because of the gospel that wouldn't be true of them. Otherwise And point it out to them Encourage them The the picture will wrap up here but the Picture of a fatherly gospel ministry. It's also one in which serious sincere gospel charge is given People are employed there. They're they're pleaded with they're charged to mold their lives to the shape of the gospel We need this we need people to spur us on in the faith We need it The truth is we are we are all susceptible to slowing down to slacking to to losing steam We are susceptible to to faltering in our motivation towards discipleship and obedience Right, maybe we maybe there are sins that we left long ago that all of a sudden we're coming back to them Maybe maybe we left lifestyles because of the gospel, but now now the grass seems greener on that side again Maybe maybe just this whole Christian life is just exhausting We talked about it last week when we sign up for the gospel. Oftentimes we sign up for a life That's harder than the one we had before If that's you let me let me implore you Jesus Jesus is worth it eternal life with him is worth it Jesus Christ is worth your whole life. He is worth you giving up that sin He is worth giving up that relationship that you knew you had to leave Christian remember, let me let me remind you what the grass looked like on the other side Remember you used to live in a kingdom of darkness and you were miserable there You weren't even a citizen there. You were a slave. That's how the Bible pictures are our lives outside of Christ But the truth is that now God has called you out of darkness and into the light of the kingdom of his beloved Son You who used to be a slave you're now a son You have God as your father You have Jesus as your Savior and your eternal brother and you have the Spirit as your helper and a guarantee of your eternal life That's coming. That's what you have now on this side And now you live to wait for Jesus to come from heaven So, let me implore you keep walking in a manner worthy of the God who called you into such a new hope-filled life keep Walking keep going do not give up Do not give up You you know this you know it don't you You know this the gospel the gospel has not come to us in vain the gospel did not come to you in vain It changed your life Keep believing it and keep living in light of it. I Love that each week We have this immediate application of what we hear We have a very straightforward way that we can remember that we can believe and that we can live Out the reality of the gospel and that's what we come to now in the Lord's Supper. Let's pray together and then we'll celebrate Father in heaven we we praise you For being the one who is worthy of our lives, we know that we've been created by you We know that we created for you. We know that in Christ. We've been redeemed to live with you forever We pray that now as we obey in this ordinance that you would Spur us on that you would encourage us by your spirit to live by faith in The one who's coming again, and we pray this all for his glory in Jesus name. Amen
