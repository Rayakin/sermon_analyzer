I'd invite you to open your Bibles to 2nd Corinthians chapter 11 I've got a long passage to consider this morning. We're gonna try to get all the way through chapter 12 verse 10 So instead of reading it all at once now, I'm just gonna read it in bits as we go along We'll get to everything in there Lord willing, but I think you'll really be helped to have your Bible open so you can follow along. I Object to all punishment whatsoever. I Don't want to punish anybody But there are an extraordinary number of people who I want to kill Not in any unkind or personal spirit But it must be evident to all of you You must all know half a dozen people at least Who are no use in this world? Who are more trouble than they're worth? And I think it would be a good thing to make everybody come before a properly appointed board Just as he might come before an income tax commissioner and say every five or every seven years Just put them there and say sir or madam Now will you be kind enough to justify your existence? If you can't justify your existence If you're not pulling your weight in the social boat if you're not producing as much as you consume or perhaps a little more Then clearly we cannot use the big organization of our society for the purpose of keeping you alive Because your life does not benefit us and it can't be a very much use to you yourself Well, so wrote the Irish playwright and polemicist George Bernard Shaw One can hope that Shaw's tongue was firmly planted in his cheek as he wrote that But he does touch on a rather large and important topic How do we justify our existence? Can we give a reason why it's better that we're here? then Not being here Shaw's words gave rise to a fun little exercise that was put on by a 21st century arts magazine The feature in this sort of cultural review was called justify your existence And they would get small sort of up-and-coming bands to come and talk about their music And then that band was challenged to fulfill the titular challenge and to justify their existence One letter of 2nd Corinthians the Apostle Paul is being challenged by some false teachers that had come into the church there in Corinth And while they weren't exactly challenging Paul to justify his existence In our passage for this morning, we see that the Apostle clearly felt the need to justify his authority To justify his behavior and to justify the message that he preached So if you look there in chapter 11 of 2nd Corinthians in verses 5 to 12 You get a sense of some of the complaints that were being lodged against Paul Again, as we read this letter, we're listening in on one side of a telephone conversation So we have to sort of use some sanctified imagination to recreate the situation there But we read in 2nd Corinthians chapter 11 starting in verse 5. Paul writes this he says indeed I consider that I am not in the least inferior to these super-apostles Even if I am unskilled in speaking I am not so in knowledge Indeed in every way we have made this plain to you in all things Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself so that you might be exalted because I preached God's gospel to you free of charge I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you And when I was with you and I was in need I did not burden anyone For the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied my need so I refrained and will refrain from burdening you in any way As the truth of Christ is in me this boasting of mine will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia And why because I do not love you God knows I do And what I am doing I will continue to do in order to undermine the claim of those who would like to claim That in their boasted mission, they work on the same terms as we do Okay, so there's a lot there but we learned some important things about Paul's opponents there in verse 5 He sort of drips with sarcasm As he calls them those super apostles In verse 12, he heaps scorn on their claim to work with the same authority and the same purpose According to the same terms that he and his ministry team works We'll think more about these opponents these super apostles in a couple of minutes But what's interesting here is the way they were attacking paul's ministry There in verse 6 he concedes that he is not the only one who is There in verse 6 he concedes that his rhetoric wasn't as refined as theirs You might remember this was a really big deal for the the softest teachers They prized the ability to tie people in knots with elaborate and eloquent speeches That was how they measured your worth and your value as a teacher But in contrast paul admits there that he was Perhaps unskilled in speaking. He wasn't the most dynamic orator Maybe he mumbled Or or stammered or just had the kind of voice that no one wants to listen to But what mattered for paul as we've seen was the content of his message christ Crucified for our sins risen from the dead in victory. What mattered to paul was not the manner of his speaking But as we've seen throughout our study of the two letters to the corinthians that we have in the scriptures What mattered to paul was that the holy spirit attended his preaching with displays of soul-saving power? He says there at the end of verse 6 whatever he lacks in eloquence and skill he says he more than makes up for in knowledge The other charge that seems to be leveled against paul was that he didn't take any money from the corinthians During the 18 months when he lived amongst them. You see that in verse 7 where he asks rhetorically and Ridiculously if he was sinning By working for the corinthians preaching the gospel to them free of charge Again in those days you judged the the worth of a philosopher by the rate that he could command If someone could charge a lot of money And had a lot of rich important powerful wealthy students Well that added to your prestige as a teacher But when paul was at corinth, he didn't take any money from the church there In fact, we know that he worked making tents to support himself And as he says there in verses 8 and 9 he took money from other churches even poorer churches Right. He had other churches the churches in macedonia. They were financially poorer than the corinthian church But they were much more mature spiritually and so paul was comfortable taking money from them knowing that that Basically the corinthians couldn't handle it If he wanted money from them, they would get confused about his motives. They would use that as a way to attack him for the apostle This willingness to work free of charge was something to boast in he says there in verse 10 It was proof verse 11 of his love for them So That's the nature of the attack on paul That was the challenge that these super apostles were leveling against him. This guy is of no account. He works for free He's not even a good speaker What we see in the rest of of this passage in chapter 11 in the first 10 verses of chapter 12 is something of paul's counter-attack We see his attempt To rescue the hearts and minds of the corinthians from these false teachers for the sake of christ And so let's look at the this passage and let's see specifically three things that are on paul's mind as he responds to these super apostles First, let's see paul's concern for the church Second, let's see paul's counter-offensive Against these false teachers And then finally, let's see paul's contentment in the lord's power So Paul's concern for the church his counter-offensive against the false teachers and his contentment in the lord's power So let's look first at paul's concern if you start there in chapter 11 verses 1 to 4 We see paul writes I wish you would bear with me in a little foolishness do bear with me For I feel a divine jealousy for you Since I betrothed you to one husband to present you as a pure virgin to christ But i'm afraid that as the serpent deceived eve by his cunning Your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to christ For if someone comes and proclaims another jesus than the one we proclaimed or if you receive a different spirit From the one you received or if you accept a different gospel from the one you accepted You put up with it readily enough So paul asks the church there to put up with a little foolishness You see this word fool or foolishness is all throughout this passage, right? It may have been a word that Paul's critics were using about him Right. We've seen oftentimes in the corinthian letters that paul likes to weaponize his opponent's language and use it against them The idea here is paul's acknowledging that to some extent he's being forced to fight fire with fire He's being forced to respond to fools with folly The super apostles are boastful They are these false teachers in the church at corinth are are constantly pointing to their credentials And so here in our passage paul says that he's going to join them in a little bit of folly. He's going to boast He's going to present his resume his spiritual credentials to the church at corinth Now to be sure he's going to do it differently. He's going to do it as we see in a christ-honoring way But he he sees here at the outset that this whole exercise is fundamentally foolish. It's not the way he wants to operate But there in verse 2 he explains why he feels the need to engage in this argument this way. He says he feels a divine Jealousy for them Literally, he says I feel a zeal from god The phrase that paul uses there seems to clearly be intended to echo back to numbers 25 If you remember the story there of of phineas in numbers 25 The idea is that phineas was outraged By the impurity by the false worship that was being manifested amongst god's people And so he took drastic measures to put it to an end You can read that story if you don't remember it in numbers 25 this afternoon And that's what we see here. Paul has that same kind of phineas-like zeal passion Jealousy to see the corinthians walking with the lord faithfully And so he uses a word picture there in verse 2 in that culture a father would betroth would would engage his daughter to a groom and in the same way Paul says I feel like a dad That has has set you all up who has committed you engaged you betrothed you as a bride for the lord jesus But just as it would be a scandal for a would-be bride to start shacking up with other men So paul is concerned that the corinthians are being spiritually unfaithful to jesus that they're pursuing other lovers so to speak There in verse 3 he's concerned that they're being deceived just like eve was deceived by satan back in the garden of eden He's worried that these false teachers will lead the corinthians Astray he says in their thoughts so that they'll no longer be pure and devoted to the lord jesus in their beliefs And so you see the issue there in verse 4 Paul is concerned That the corinthians are far too patient That they're willing to put up with things they are too accepting of false teachers and false doctrines and as a result they are vulnerable to the devil's deceits These false teachers paul says came in and they preached and proclaimed a different jesus Paul doesn't shed much light on it there in verse 4 but given his passion For proclaiming the folly of christ crucified in weakness and giving his given his opponent's apparent passion for glory and impressive powerful displays of human wisdom It's likely that these false teachers were presenting to the church something like a superhero jesus Right a triumphant jesus that solves all your problems instead of the man of sorrows Acquainted with grief that paul had proclaimed to them The spirit paul says that comes with this false. Jesus Was certainly not the holy spirit of god The gospel there in verse 4. He says the message of salvation that proclaims this false. Jesus Paul says that's not the gospel that I proclaimed So he's concerned that the church is too willing Too quick to accept this false gospel of a false. Jesus brought to them by a false spirit So Church we As a congregation need to be discerningly intolerant Now tolerance is a virtue It is good to be patient with people who are weak or confused Or perhaps simply different than we are It is good for people to feel loved and welcomed But there are limits to this virtue There are situations that call for other virtues There are times when tolerance is the wrong play If someone wants to abduct your child You shouldn't be tolerant If a mechanic wants to put the wrong brake pads on your car You shouldn't be tolerant And so paul is saying to the corinthians and to us This is not the kind of thing you can put up with This is not the kind of thing you tolerate you can't afford to be accepting and flexible and patient When it comes to this kind of spiritual poison That's why I said we need to be discerningly intolerant Right. We don't embody the priorities and the principles of the lord. Jesus by by simply being strident and harsh With those with whom we disagree We don't want to be divisive We don't want to be a church that's willing to go to war and separate from our brothers and sisters and and lob bombs over relatively unimportant issues Right. We don't want to treat our brothers and sisters as enemies just because they have different positions from us on things like baptism Or or politics or vaccines or quarantines or masks or or the end times? But When it comes to the proclamation of jesus The fully divine fully eternal fully human son of god in flesh crucified for our sins risen from the dead in glory Ascended into heaven one day returning jesus the lord to whom we all owe all obedience and allegiance In short the jesus that we confessed earlier using the words of the nicaean creed when it comes to the proclamation of that jesus We can tolerate no other message When it comes to the proclamation of the gospel salvation Not by anything we do Not something that we earn But something that comes to us by god's grace through faith alone when it comes to that gospel message that paul preached Church, we can tolerate no other message Because ultimately no other jesus can save you no other gospel can save you the holy spirit of god Only works through the message of jesus Any other message comes with the spirit of the enemy So we need to be discerningly intolerant We need to be a congregation committed to sticking closely to the message of the gospel Rehearsing it over and over in our life together building our life around it And we need to pass it on faithfully to the next generation So young people here this morning you Under god's guidance under god's care. You are tasked with the responsibility Of believing the gospel that you've heard in this church And then making sure that it goes forward Making sure that the church continues to proclaim that message long after i'm gone and after your parents are gone The old saying is that When the message of salvation comes the first generation believes the gospel The second generation assumes the gospel And the third generation loses the gospel And friends we we can't afford to let that happen We can't assume that the gospel message is clear enough that everyone knows it that everyone understands it Because it's the gospel message the message of the jesus presented to us in scriptures proclaimed by paul is the only message that saves So that's paul's concern He's concerned that the the church is too tolerant of these false teachers The next thing to see is paul's counteroffensive against them look there in verses 13 to 15 He says for such men are false apostles deceitful workmen disguising themselves as apostles of christ And no wonder for even satan disguises himself as an angel of light So it is no surprise if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness Their end will correspond to their deeds Okay, so paul's taking the gloves off here what he's been sort of speaking around and alluding to he now makes explicit These super apostles in quotes are in fact fakes and liars false apostles deceitful workmen These are not misguided well-intentioned believers He says they are spiritual predators sent from the evil one Paul says ominously there at the end of verse 15 their end will correspond to their deeds Right unless they repent they will face the judgment of god But the question is how on earth did these Interlopers work their way into this church that paul had planted How did they manage to dislodge the apostle from the corinthians affections How did they manage to supplant his pure gospel with their false doctrine? Well, they didn't do it by coming out and being honest They didn't introduce themselves as false teachers They didn't say hey just to be clear. We are in it for the money and the prestige Uh, just to be clear if you follow our teaching you will certainly go to hell No instead What we see is that they used deceit verse 13 Deceitful workmen paul calls them they disguised themselves. They're in verse 13 as apostles of christ They're in verse 15. They disguised themselves as servants of righteousness And listen, this wasn't an accidental strategy This wasn't something that just happened upon these false teachers were calling plays right out of the devil's playbook They deceived because satan himself is a deceiver Remember paul's worried that they're going to be deceived just like eve was deceived by the evil one back in the garden Right. The evil one knows that no one would follow him if he were honest about his intentions If he told the truth about his temptations and where they lead no one would ever go after him And so what does paul tell us that he does? He disguises himself as an angel of light He he wraps his spiritual poison in a candy coating to make it seem sweet and delicious Until it's too late He makes his lies Seem attractive he buries the hook deep in the bait. He makes his perversions seem righteous So friends this means that we need to be discerning Again as a church, we cannot afford the luxury of being gullible or naive or overly trusting The picture that paul paints for us here is of an evil one who is constantly at work trying to gain access to christ's church And generally you're not going to gain a lot of traction walking into a christian church and announcing that you're there to introduce apostasy and compromise and schism and deceit And so his strategy is to use falsehood to make lies seem true by Maybe connecting elements of falsehood to truth By making a half truth seem like the whole truth By putting a plausible spin on a spiritually destructive idea And again, I think if we look at our day and age we see this Principle this dynamic at work. We see the outside world working its way into churches under the guise of righteousness And we see congregations divert their energies from the proclamation of the gospel to advocating for all sorts of political causes on the left and on the right And I trust that churches did that not in an intentional effort to abandon the message of salvation But because they thought they were standing up for what is right All right, we see congregations Affirming behaviors and practices that are clearly incompatible with following christ And again, I don't think they did that because they self-consciously wanted to give up the gospel Because it seemed like a loving and kind thing to do I think we see this in the way the gospel gets twisted around in our churches Whether it's the prosperity gospel That takes a truth God loves you God will provide for you. God cares for you. God gives good gifts to his children They take that truth and pervert it Into the only thing god will ever give you is all the money and all the health you want All god cares about is providing you with with stability and happiness Or even legalism Which takes the truth That god is very holy And that we are called to obey him And that no one can be a follower of christ without acknowledging his lordship and following after him taking that truth And turning it into a message of self-salvation through self-effort Right all of those things from outside the church and inside the church are threats to the church that come to us in the guise of friendship That come saying hey be holy be loving be courageous They come as angels of light They come with bible verses usually out of context They come with biblical terms and seemingly godly concerns But you know, they're false because they they tempt us To latch on to another jesus to a different gospel, even if we might still for now Affirm the the truths that we've been taught So church we need to be discerning We need to make sure that all of the elders that we recognize as a church In the words that paul writes to titus We need to make sure that all of the elders we recognize as a church hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught So that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it As individuals we need to be alert Right you you walk through a minefield Through a minefield Differently than you take a walk in a park, right? The awareness that there is hidden danger Makes you vigilant And so here paul is warning us That the devil is actively hiding his spiritual traps from our perception And so we have to be aware when you pick up a book Where you see a preacher on tv where you hear someone on a radio or you listen to a podcast don't assume that they're trustworthy Just because they quote the bible Just because they say some things that sound plausible Avail yourself of trustworthy teachers avail yourself of resources that will help you understand the bible Well help you grasp the true gospel that the church has believed and proclaimed since the beginning And stare closely at those things so that you can spot a counterfeit when it comes The devil doesn't get into the church by being honest. He disguises himself as an angel of light Paul's concern is that the corinthians are too willing to embrace a false gospel He launches a counteroffensive against these false teachers and their satanic deceit And so let's look at our third point that is paul's contentment in god's power There in verses 16 to 21 of chapter 11 We read this I repeat let no one think me foolish But even if you do accept me as a fool So that I too may boast a little What I am saying with this boastful confidence. I say not as the lord would but as a fool Since many boast according to the flesh I too will boast For you gladly bear with fools being wise yourselves For you bear it if someone makes slaves of you or devours you or takes advantage of you or puts on airs Or strikes you in the face To my shame. I must say we were too weak for that Well, as I mentioned earlier in this passage paul is indulging what he calls a little foolish boasting We're there in verse 18 boasting according to the flesh He would rather not have to lay out his credentials, right? That's why he says there in verse 17 This is not as the lord would right? This is not the way the ministry of christ should look But he's being forced to play a game. He'd rather not play He can't abandon the church to these false teachers And so he has no choice He gets pretty sarcastic there in verses 19 to 21 as a as a deeply sarcastic person I feel justified in my life choices by some of the things paul says here He says I need to be a fool in order to reach you because apparently you love fools You are so wise you gladly bear with all sorts of nonsense. You have wisdom to burn You're so wise you can afford to be stupid he says There in verse 20 you seem to bear it very well When these false teachers mistreat you they exploit you they deceive you enslave you devour you and for some reason You can't get enough of it Paul says there at the beginning of verse 21. I'm only sorry that I was too weak to pull that off When I was with you, I couldn't manage to abuse and manipulate you That seems to be the way to get your attention He said instead I had to be kind And gentle and loving And again just to be clear he's being sarcastic here Paul moves on to compare himself to these false teachers. He says they're in the middle of verse 21 But whatever anyone else dares to boast of I am speaking as a fool I also dare to boast of that Are they hebrews? So am I are they israelites? So am I are they offspring of abraham? So am I So it seems these false teachers must have come from a jewish background And so here paul goes toe-to-toe with them on their credentials. He says they don't have anything to boast in That I can't boast in But then he takes a turn there in the middle of verse 23 He says are they servants of christ There at the beginning of verse 23. Are they servants of christ? I am a better one I am talking like a madman and then Paul proceeds to turn everything on its head. He does a little bit of gospel judo here Right, we expect him to keep now heaping up his accomplishments He says okay You're a jew me too. You think you're a servant of christ? I'm a better one and we expect paul's going to say let me tell you all the churches I planted Right. Let me tell you all the amazing things i've done Let me tell you about the time on the damascus road. The lord. Jesus appeared to me personally and commissioned me for this work Right. Let me let me tell you about the gospel that I heard directly from the man. Jesus himself Right. That's what we expect paul's going to do But instead he goes from comparing his privileges his spiritual lineage and he he begins instead to celebrate his suffering and his weakness Look there in the middle of verse 23 or actually start at the beginning of verse 23 again. We read are they servants of christ? I'm a better one I'm talking like a madman Okay. And again, this is where we think we're going to get a list of paul's accomplishments, but he goes on and he says with far greater labors Far more imprisonments. This is the middle of verse 23 with countless beatings often near death Five times I received at the hands of the jews the 40 lashes lest one Three times I was beaten with rods once I was stoned three times. I was ship shipwrecked a night and a day I was adrift at sea on frequent journeys in danger from rivers danger from robbers Danger from my own people danger from gentiles danger in the city danger in the wilderness danger at sea danger from false brothers In toil and hardship through many a sleepless night in hunger and thirst often without food In cold and exposure and apart from all other things. There is the daily pressure on me of my anxiety for all the churches Who is weak And i'm not weak Who is made to fall and I am not indignant? If I must boast I will boast of the things that show my weakness The god and father of the lord. Jesus. He who is blessed forever knows that I am not lying At damascus the governor under king eritus was guarding the city of damascus in order to seize me But I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped his hands So paul has pulled us back on the tracks He's going to indulge in a little foolish boasting But he says he's only going to boast in things that show how weak he is He's not going to boast like these godless super apostles about his knowledge and his money and his eloquence and his accomplishments Instead to show that he's a superior servant of christ He gives us a list of sufferings and weakness and humiliation And humiliation For the sake of time i'm not going to go into each one of the things that he mentioned You can take a look a tour of the book of acts and find a lot of the things that paul talks about Here in second corinthians 11 are recorded for us in the book of acts But the point of all of those things the reason why paul heaps them up the real thing He wants to boast in the real evidence of the legitimacy of his ministry Is just how much he suffered He has all the credentials that those false teachers could claim as israelites But they could not hold a candle to his far greater labors far more imprisonments countless beatings often near death Paul's not finished Sort of laying out his spiritual resume though There in chapter 12. He continues on he's got one more thing. He wants to bring to the corinthians attention He says there in verse 1 of chapter 12, I must go on boasting Though there is nothing to be gained by it. I will go on to visions and revelations of the lord He says we've covered heritage as an israelite check We've covered incredible suffering and humiliation check Let's talk about visions and revelations from god He says you're impressed by these super apostles Tell me tell me if they've had a vision if they've had a revelation like i've had as an actual real apostle That might be surprising to us to to hear paul speak in those terms It's a bit unusual, but we do know that he had as I mentioned earlier a vision of the lord Jesus on the road to damascus. He was going there to to destroy the church. He was arrested by the risen lord. Jesus Confronted in his sin and that's how he became a follower of christ We know that other apostles like john had an extended vision when he was in exile On the island of patmos. That's the book that we call revelation at the end of our new testament And so here we find paul lets us in on another such experience A vision a revelation we read about it there in verse verses two to six Paul says I know a man in christ Who 14 years ago was caught up to the third heaven? Whether in the body or out of the body. I do not know god knows And I know that this man was caught up into paradise whether in the body or out of the body. I do not know god knows And he heard things that cannot be told Which man may not utter? On behalf of this man, I will boast But on my own behalf I will not boast except of my weakness Though if I should wish to boast I would not be a fool if I would be speaking the truth But I refrain from it so that no one may think more of me than he sees in me or hears from me So there in verse 2 paul speaks about something that happened 14 years ago to a man in christ that he knows And I think it's pretty clear that paul is talking about paul here Right. He's speaking in the third person to to distance himself a bit From the things that he'd rather not talk about As we see he's going to take this thing that happened to this guy And he's going to apply it to his own life and ministry So it seems pretty clear that he's really the person that he's talking about here But what happened is that 14 years ago? He was caught up. He says in verse 2 to the third heaven There in verse 3 he he clarifies into paradise Now it's not perfectly clear what paul means by the third heaven When the ancients spoke about the heavens it could kind of mean three things They could refer to the heavens as the sky so simply the place where the the birds fly and the clouds float They could refer to what we call out maybe outer space Right where the where the moon and the other planets are sort of beyond the sky and then beyond that Heaven could refer to sort of the realm beyond outer space the the place where god himself dwells that unseen realm It could also be that paul's talking about sort of sort of inner layers of heaven sort of if heaven Reflects something like the design of the ancient temple the third heaven would be sort of the inmost part the holy of holies where god Was particularly present it's not clear But what is clear is that paul doesn't want to talk about it. He doesn't want to give us a lot of details There's all sorts of speculation Which is remarkable because paul says look it's not the kind of thing human beings can utter when I see what I saw and what? I heard Right, we're not sure how it happened Paul isn't even sure if he was there in his body or out of his body He says in verse two and three he heard things that can't be conveyed in human language Right, but the idea is that paul had this extraordinary vision of heaven of god's presence And that's pretty amazing You can see why paul might be tempted to sort of bust that vision out as a weapon against these false teachers Right, they they think they're so great But tell me have they ever seen the third heaven have had they ever been judged worthy by god of such an amazing spiritual experience That's not how paul does business And that's not what he's saying here there in verses five and six He said he could boast like that because it would actually be true But there in verse six he says he refrains lest people think too much of him He doesn't want to in any way glorify himself Even if it's at the expense of these super apostles Because what paul really wants to talk about What all of this foolish boasting of his is heading towards in his mind is not his greatness But rather as he says there in verse six his weakness even this story of an extraordinary vision Is ultimately paul says about highlighting his weakness His boasting is ultimately a way to point to christ And not to himself So he continues there in chapter 7 in verses 7 to 10 He says so to keep me from becoming conceited because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations A thorn was given me in the flesh a messenger of satan to harass me to keep me from becoming conceited Three times I pleaded with the lord about this that it should leave me But he said to me my grace is sufficient for you For my power is made perfect in weakness. Therefore. I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses So that the power of christ may rest upon me For the sake of christ then I am content with weaknesses insults hardships persecutions and calamities for when I am weak Then I am strong Paul Moves on to tell us about god's plan for for keeping him from becoming conceited In light of these surpassing revelations this amazing vision that he had of the third heaven twice there in verse 7 He tells us that this was one of the lord's purposes in what followed right to keep him from becoming conceited All right. Just think about it. If you kept a log for one week of all the stupid stuff you bragged about Right all the stupid stuff you told other people to try and impress them in even some small way Now imagine that god swept you up into heaven and you had a vision of the third heaven, whatever that is You can see how you would be tempted to to be conceited And so paul or i'm sorry rather god takes measures to prevent paul from going down that spiritually destructive path there in verse 7 Paul says that he was given a thorn in the flesh That word that's translated there is thorn really could mean any sort of sharp object Right sort of stabbing him in the side like a like a stake or a splinter But paul doesn't actually tell us a ton about this trouble. We do see six things about the nature of this thorn that's given to him At first as I already mentioned it was given to him to keep him from becoming conceited It was given to him to inoculate him against the temptation to self-importance in light of this vision Second we do see there in verse 7 that it was given to him Right paul sees this thorn As a as a kind of terrible gift It seems clear from all that follows that the person who gave this gift to him Is the lord jesus himself? We're going to see this thorn Has a divine purpose Third we see that it's a thorn in the flesh verse 7 It seems that paul understood this trouble as something that took place in his body or at least in the realm of this world We don't really know what this thorn was exactly. I think the most likely guesses are there was some debilitating physical ailment Or some kind of sort of persistent opposition to his ministry like he was experiencing in corinth The fourth thing we see here is that this thorn was a messenger he says from satan in verse 7 Even though this gift was given to him by god Even though it would serve a good and divine purpose Paul also sees that it has some kind of diabolical origin All right. This is a paradox. We see throughout the scriptures god uses the devil's malignant plans for his own good purposes That's certainly the case here fifth. We see that this thorn this messenger harassed him And literally the word that paul uses there it means to beat with fists Right. The apostle is speaking figuratively here, but the idea is that this was no small issue This was something he says that that tormented him And sixth we see that paul pleaded with the lord repeatedly For the thorn to be removed to be taken away to be kept from him We're not told explicitly that his request was denied, but it clearly was For we see the lord's explanation there in verse 9 Jesus does not remove the affliction, but he does explain it In verse 9 he says my grace Is sufficient for you That is to say paul is not abandoned To endure this struggle alone in his own strength In his own strength But the lord jesus so there in verse 8 Paul says he pleaded with the lord almost always when paul says the lord he's talking about the lord. Jesus The lord jesus is is present with him The greek word has the sense of uh of being completely adequate Right that that idea of sufficiency. It means that there is not one Tiny thing that paul needs to endure this struggle that is not present and provided for him in the grace That the lord jesus gives paul has all of the help that he needs. He will lack for nothing As he faces this difficulty Then the lord tells him why the thorn has to remain he says my power is made perfect in weakness Uh, the power of god is brought to completion it achieves its purpose in weakness Again, this is a theme we've seen throughout second corinthians Paul remember in chapter 4 talks about being a weak and fragile jar of clay to demonstrate the surpassing power of god And of course the lord jesus himself is the ultimate example of power in weakness Right, we can't think of paul being harassed or literally beaten with fists without our minds going to christ's Humiliation at the hands of the men who were holding him in custody before his crucifixion We can't think of paul pleading for relief from this suffering without thinking about the lord jesus Pleading that this cup might pass from him in the garden of gethsemane Jesus's suffering jesus's weakness jesus's humiliation before his enemies was the ultimate Perfect example of god's saving power being manifested through what looks like weakness And so again, we see what paul has been hammering throughout this book that that genuine christian ministry is carried out in a manner that is Consistent with the manner in which christ walked That's a lesson That he learned through suffering Again there at the end of verse 9 he tells us he moved from pleading that this thorn would be removed to now he says boasting in it He went from begging the lord jesus to remove it to saying this is what I want to tell people about because his lack Has proven to be an opportunity for the power of christ to rest upon him. He says There at the end of verse 10 He says that what he's learned is that it's actually when he's weak It's actually then that he's truly strong Because when we lack the resources we need when we cannot possibly face the problems in front of us When we cannot possibly endure the challenges that beset us. It's in those moments. It's in those circumstances Where we are weak That the power of christ is seen most clearly So paul's conclusion to all of this there in verse 10. I am content That translation is actually a little weak I think it's it's better understood That paul's saying I am delighted His opponents mock his weakness They mock the gifts that he lacks they mock the way he seems to keep suffering For them his his weakness as he says there in verse 10 his his insults hardship persecution those calamities Those were proof that god did not regard him. They were proof that he was of no account but for paul They were a cause of boasting They were protection Against becoming conceited they were an arena in which the power of the grace of the lord Jesus was put on display for everyone to see So brothers and sisters, I think the application to our lives is is pretty clear pretty direct You haven't been called to paul's specific ministry and it is unlikely that you will experience the things that paul experienced in terms of visions and suffering in this life But god's purpose in your life Is the same as it was in paul's to display the power of the lord. Jesus through your weakness And to cause you to even delight in it Because he will make your suffering an avenue for his grace He will graciously help you and strengthen you in your troubles And friends that's really important to have clear in your head now Because either you are suffering right now Or you will be suffering at some point in the future But when it comes if it hasn't already you need to have this clear in your mind That suffering could take a number of forms it could be a physical ailment It could be a painful relational difficulty It could be an abiding temptation that you have pled with the lord to take away It could be an emotional darkness that just doesn't seem to lift an anxiety That that simply won't go away In those cases We we are tempted to think that if god really loved us If we pled enough Well, then he would take it away Again, that's what the that's what the world outside these doors would teach us That's what even false gospels coming into the church would teach us if god loves you he really loved you He would never make you suffer. He would never make you weak. He would never Cause any do put you through anything that would cause you pain Right. We're tempted to think that god would respond to our prayers with Of course my child. I love you. I would never want you to experience any kind of weakness But brothers and sisters god actually has something better for us Than than momentary comfort and ease When we view our thorns and our struggles through the lenses that paul offers us here Right instead of panicking Instead of raging against god instead of giving in to despair when we take those weaknesses to christ And should he decide not to remove them Resolve to delight in them Because we can trust that through them. He will give us the grace and the help that we need Well, then jesus will make our weakness A display of his power He will show his character. He will show the pattern of his life in us And he will use that to point people to christ Despite all that we lack despite all that we are not Not He will use our weakness to protect us from the spiritual cancer of pride By making it clear that we do not have the resources in and of ourselves to endure And he will fill us He will fill us up all that We like with all of the grace that we need with all of the help and all of the comfort to sustain us Church family, this is one of the ways we make much of jesus in this world This is one of the ways that we live out our calling to be a counter-cultural community Amidst the prosperity amidst the striving of northern virginia With god's grace with his help. We can be a people who are not unnerved and undone and embittered by trials and suffering and difficulty We can be people who are content More than that. We can be people who delight in weakness and trouble and what we lack We're not seduced by the idea that our wealth or our access to power our education our career achievements We are not seduced by the idea that those things are the very best gifts god has to give us Instead we trust that god will give us christ That he will give us the ultimate example of his saving power displayed in weakness and pain god will give us grace and help Not in the context of our strength, but in the context of our weakness With this Counterintuitive way that's on display for us at the lord's table As we come to the lord's table We are reminded that the saving power of god the grace that sustains us now and gives us hope into eternity Comes to us not in a demonstration of strength and grandeur, but it comes to us in suffering and weakness It is a broken body It is shed blood that is held out to us So brothers and sisters, let's come together to the table Let's rejoice In the memory in the celebration of the incredible powerful weakness of christ Let's come in confidence that he is able to give us grace in all of our trials and troubles Let's pray together Amen Heavenly father we thank you for your great love for us That when we struggle when we suffer when we are beset by weaknesses and thorns We need not doubt your love because you've sent your son Lord jesus, we thank you that you Who were rich and powerful beyond all measure Endured humiliation and weakness and shame So that we might experience the grace and the help and the power that we need Holy spirit. We pray that you would give us eyes to see The goodness and the grace of the lord. Jesus. We pray that you would help us spirit to rejoice in the troubles that we endure And we pray that you would display the the power and the majesty of christ through us And it's in his name that we pray amen
