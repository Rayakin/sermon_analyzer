Apologies ahead of time, if you hear me clearing my throat a number of times today, it's been that kind of week. Also apologies for no fun crowd-pleasing intro like a few times ago. We talked about, wow I'm blanking on the name now. What was the song? What do we sing? Ain't no mountain high enough, my goodness. Yeah. This is the second week that we'll be looking at Psalm 23. If you were with us a few weeks ago, we looked at the first three verses. And if nothing else was clear in those three verses, my hope was to show that the whole psalm, the whole psalm, all six verses are really a reflection of that first verse. The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. Everything falls from that first sentence. Even more specifically, everything really falls from that first phrase. The Lord is my shepherd. That when you and I really open our hands to the fact that Yahweh is our shepherd, that the in the beginning God is our shepherd, that the I Am is my shepherd, when you and I do that, then we can actually look out into the world. We can even look at the whole of our lives with all of the blessings and all of the unknowns ahead of us. And we can still say, we can even certainly say to ourselves, I lack nothing. I lack nothing. When we know who it is that our shepherd is, we can follow David's line of thinking and conclude with him, I lack nothing. That's what I shall not want means. It's not that you don't want anything, it's that you want for nothing. You lack nothing is what it says there. If you know that Yahweh is your shepherd, you know you lack nothing. Now again, it's maybe the most familiar psalm in the world, among the most famous passages of Scripture in all the Bible. And so there's going to be some familiarity in these texts that can be like obstacles. And there are three obstacles here in us that can keep us from really understanding what it means that the Lord is our shepherd. First obstacle, first of three. The third is going to get us into our text. The first obstacle to understanding that Yahweh is your shepherd is that you don't know who Yahweh is. It's obvious. Maybe you're newer to the Bible. Yahweh is God's name. It's the name that he revealed to Moses and to his people. So anytime you see the Lord in all caps in your Bible, the Hebrew words are Yahweh. It's not the title, the Lord. It's God's name. But I imagine many of us are here knowing that already. We know Yahweh. We know that's his name. We know his story. But underneath that a little bit, I wonder if we know him only formally. We know him on paper. We know that he's the creator. We know that he gave the Ten Commandments. We know that he chose Israel. We even know that he's the one we're supposed to worship. Friends, you could know those things and you would know him no better than the Pharisees did in Jesus' day. You could know all of that to a T. You could chapter and verse that to a T and you would know him no better than Jesus' very enemies, the ones who rejected him to his face. There's a version of knowing the facts about God that misses the point about God. You can know all the ingredients of a meal and not know what the meal tastes like. There's that famous scene in the movie Good Will Hunting. It came out 26 years ago, by the way. Just looked that up this morning. So just a classic black and white movie basically. There's that scene where Robin Williams' character plays the older sage man. He's talking to Matt Damon's character. He's the main character, Will. And they're talking in the Boston Common and Damon plays this genius who knows everything about everything. He's a polymath. He retains everything he reads. But he uses his intelligence as a shield. He keeps people away with it. He puts people down with it. And Williams' character tells him this, if I asked you about art, you could probably give me the skinny on every art book ever written. Michelangelo, you know a lot about him. His life's work, political aspirations, him and the Pope, the whole thing, right? But I bet you can't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never actually stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. Listen, kid, you're tough. I could ask you about war. You'd probably throw Shakespeare at me. Once more into the breach, dear friends. But you've never been near one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him gasp his last breath. You get what he's saying. Damon's a younger man. He knows all these things, in fact, on paper. He doesn't know any of these things personally. You can know God in the same way. We can know God, we can know his stats, we can know his resume, and we can miss the startling intimacy that the God of history has taken on the job of shepherding you. So that's the first obstacle when it comes to understanding whether the Lord is our shepherd. Do you know Yahweh? Second obstacle, related, is you don't know who you are. Specifically, you don't know how much you need a shepherd. This affects all of us, of course, to different degrees. Only God knows to what degree this is true of you. But the more you see yourself as being in the driver's seat of your life, the more you see yourself as knowing what's best for you. The more you see you not needing anybody else's help, the less it will resonate for you that God is your shepherd. Why would it when you act like you're your own? We didn't talk about this much last time, but we should consider the metaphor David is using here, shepherd and sheep. He's not just using this metaphor just because it's familiar. He's not just using this metaphor to evoke sense of feelings of calmness and fluffiness and peace. He's giving us this metaphor to disabuse us all of how smart we think we are. Because sheep, every last one of them, are idiots. They literally follow one another off cliffs, actually do that. But their simpleness, it almost has a purity to it, doesn't it? It has a purity because it's showing us what they were meant to live like, how they were meant to be, what they were created for. They were created to follow a leader. They were actually created and designed this way. They live best when following a shepherd's lead. They need a shepherd to keep them in line, even pick them up when they're injured, keep them from falling into a ditch and dying. That's how we are made also. That's why David is using this metaphor. He's holding up a mirror to us. This would have been abundantly clear in David, the former shepherd's mind. The former shepherd and mighty warrior and king and conqueror of lands, he is saying, I, me, great King David, I'm happy to be just one of Yahweh's otherwise helpless sheep. We can tend to forget this. We can even disbelieve this in this setting with all of the accomplishments in this room. One pastor tells this story. I took my friend D out to lunch once. He's homeless, but he wasn't always this way. He used to be an engineer at GM. Then his wife and son died in a car accident. And everything just fell apart. He became deeply distressed. He lost his job, lost his house. I asked D what frustrates him most about the people who walk by him every day. And I expected to hear him complain about how they ignore a fellow human who's reaching out to them in need. No, he said his biggest frustration is seeing these people walk back and forth with no idea they depend on God for everything. They just don't know. Do you know? Do you know who you are? Do you know what you are? Not knowing Yahweh, not knowing ourselves, third obstacle, third obstacle to seeing God as our shepherd, what we'll focus on today, the beginning of verse four. It's an obstacle if you are walking through the valley of the shadow of death right now. It's not exactly what it feels like really to be shepherded in our minds at least. That can be an obstacle. Let me read this psalm in full for us once more. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me besides still waters. He restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness for his namesake. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for you are with me. Your rod and your staff, they comfort me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil. My cup overflows. Surely, goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life. Surely, goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life. And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever. The psalm in a sentence is that the Lord shepherds you in the pasture and in the valley because that's the way home. The Lord shepherds you in the pasture and in the valley because that's the way home. And today we're just going to look at that middle part that he shepherds us in the valley. This is really just me asking the question, why preach one sermon on a text when you can preach three? So that's what we're in. We're in two of probably three today. All right, look back at verse four. Again, set aside how familiar you are with this sermon. Set yourself into the setting of being a sheep before a shepherd. Verse four comes out of nowhere. Right after verses one through three. Green pastures, quiet waters, paths of righteousness. These are scenes of comfort, right? And safety and rest. Suddenly the shadow of death. Things were going great, God. God, you were so present. You laid me down in the grass. You led me to the water. You led me down the right paths. My soul felt restored. Then you cut the power. Then darkness. The literal word there in Hebrew is deep darkness. It says the valley of deep darkness. It's a darkness where you can't see anything. And because you can't see anything, evil breeds there. It's darkness that makes you feel vulnerable. You feel exposed. I quoted from this book in the last sermon, but Philip Keller, he wrote a book called A Shepherd Looks at Psalm 23, and he writes about valleys here. They are often, the valleys, are on the floor of steep walled canyons and gulches. There may be towering cliffs above them on either side. The valley floor itself may be in dark shadow with the sun, seldom reaching the bottom except for a few hours around noon. The shepherd knows that predators like coyotes, bears, wolves, cougars can take cover in these cliffs and prey on the flock. He knows these valleys can be subject to storms and flash floods that send walls of water rampaging down the slopes. There could be rock slides, mud or snow avalanches, and a dozen other natural disasters that would destroy or injure his sheep. Yeah, the shadow of death is all over the valley. I wonder if you've felt this kind of darkness around you before. Another way to ask the question, when in life have you felt most afraid? When in life have you felt most vulnerable, most powerless? Maybe you can't think of an answer. What makes you fearful about life right now? What makes you feel vulnerable right now? It can help to even consider how sheep act when they're afraid. When sheep are afraid, they do one of three or four things. They huddle to feel safety in numbers. They start to bleat. They baa. They want the shepherd's attention. They want to get the other sheep's attention. They freeze to kind of blend in to hide or they start to run. And if a group of them are scared, they stampede. That's basically what we do when we're afraid. What in your life is causing you to react in one of those ways? To huddle, to hide, to bleat, to run. What makes you want to do that? Maybe your family feels unstable. Your job feels fragile. Your health is becoming concerning. Your relationships are strained. Your finances are troubling. The darkness is growing and the walls are closing in and the nightmares might actually come true. You're afraid. This all makes us to ask. It makes us ask the psalm and ask about our lives. Why in the world would the shepherd of verses 1 through 3 take the sheep down to the valley here in verse 4? What kind of shepherd would do that? Did he quit? Are the sheep by themselves down here? After the pastures and the still waters, after all that comfort and rest, why would he take the sheep down to the valley? Why would he do that? After all that comfort and rest, why the valley? Why the darkness? The sheep are not alone in the valley and in fact it is the shepherd who has brought them there. Remember the whole psalm falls from the first line. The Lord is my shepherd. He is the shepherd in verse 4. The shepherd that leads sheep to green pastures and quiet waters is the same shepherd that leads them down to the valley and this makes sense because one reason the shepherd takes the sheep down to the valley, if you can believe it, is that for part of the year the grass is actually greener in the valley. That's just how land in the near east works. The shepherd's land only has so much grass and water and when the seasons change, the land will change, things will change. Meanwhile, the sheep still have to eat every day so they need to go somewhere else to go feed, to find grass and water and it turns out in the summer the valleys are where rivers and streams are still flowing. On the high ground, the pools, the springs there have already dried up. There's no water. The valleys are actually where it's still lush and there's still food. Keller writes again, the valleys are the well-watered route. During the summer months, the long days can be hot and tiresome. The flocks experience intense thirst. How glad they are for the frequent watering places along the valley route where they can be refreshed. What does this mean? It means that verse 4 doesn't ultimately conflict with verses 1 through 3. It means that those verses can even be true at the same time because as David personally knew, there were pastures and waters in the valley. The right path goes through the valley throughout the summer. That's actually the right way to go. So these verses aren't describing some sheep who always live comfortably while others are always in fear. They're describing what's the normal rhythm for every sheep's life in that part of the world. Every sheep's life in that part of the world under the watch of a wise shepherd who knows that they need to eat grass and drink water year-round. Sometimes it's going to be in easy and pleasant places. Other times it's going to be a bit of a journey. Either way, the sheep are going to eat. Brothers and sisters, many of you have been in a valley. You might even be there now, and it's been painful, exhausting, but I wonder as you've endured and as you've gone through this journey, but I wonder as you've endured hard day after hard day after yet another hard day, have you not also found your shepherd providing for you in the valley? That even in overwhelming darkness, your needs are still being met. Even more, I wonder, have you felt yourself getting leaner, even getting stronger through the valley, walking through rocky ravines? Have you felt some of the excess, some of the softness that comes with the easy life start to burn away a little bit? Have you felt it? If you have felt it, you know it's hard, but it means that the shepherd is making sure that you make it all the way through. It's dark, but that also means your senses have become heightened to things that you once overlooked. Have you felt that? It is another fun fact. I think I like saw this last night or this morning. While you're going through the valley, while you're getting stronger in the valley, the parasites that used to infest your pasture and the water that you drank back at home and feed on you, they now have nothing to eat, so they start to die off. What does that mean? That means you being sent away to the valley. It's actually refreshing the blessedness that you are used to back home. That unless you leave, the grass and the water of home are not going to be green and quiet for you. They're going to be ravaged with parasites, bugs, other things I don't know how to pronounce. I wonder if you've noticed that after some time in the valley, after the Lord takes you away for a little while, if you don't feel His goodness a little more in the things that you used to take for granted. But it's a sense that it's not just more appreciation for the same old things. It's more appreciation that comes from the Lord. It's more appreciation that comes from the Lord. It's more appreciation that comes with less entitlement. Those things come together when they're from God, I believe. When God sends you through the valley for a spell and you come back to enjoying the things you used to enjoy, have you noticed that as you enjoy them even more, as it's sweeter than it was before, that you also are a little more open-handed about it all? That's the Lord inviting you to enjoy His blessings without letting those blessings take over your life, without letting those blessings become parasites and eat you. That's the source of so much of the turmoil in our lives, isn't it? We take good things and make them ultimate things and we live and die by them. Live and die by them. It's when we learn that God prepares every blessing for every time of our lives that we learn to say at every point in our lives, I lack nothing. In addition to those, there's an even bigger reason for the valley. Gets back to how the psalm begins. The main reason for Yahweh bringing you to the valley is for you to know that He is with you. It's at the very center of the whole psalm. You might even notice that the language changes from third person to first person. Verses 1 through 3, He, He, He. And here in the valley, here in the darkness, here where it's painful, you are with me. I will fear no evil for you are with me. That's the degree of closeness. That's the degree of trust that David has for Yahweh. That's the closeness that the valley invites us to have. In fact, we actually can draw closer to God in the valley than we can in the pastures. Think about it. It's one thing to have a friend when it's light. It's a whole other thing to have a friend when it's dark. Isn't it? How much more you treasure the voice of a friend in the dark. How much more you pay attention. How much more you grow in your trust of them. More so in the dark than in the light. That's the context the valley is offering you. The Lord inviting you, know me more. Call me by my name, my first name. The stronger the valley's threats, the deeper the valley's darkness, the closer God's companionship is for His sheep. Because isn't that the great trick of darkness at the end of the day? What's the great power of darkness? It's not just that you can't see what's ahead of you. That's not the biggest thing. The blind can fare quite well. What's even worse, what's even trickier that darkness does? It makes you feel alone. That you have to navigate the unknown by yourself. And that power, of course, also becomes its weakness. Because when you're in the dark with someone else, the dark isn't that bad. I think we've all experienced this, right? There's a big difference between being in the dark, being alone in the dark, and being in the dark with somebody else, right? One's a horror movie. The other is, I don't know, kind of like a fun-ass horror movie. Like a party or something. Just great bonding is what it is. You might remember the story of the Chilean miners in 2010. Just crazy story. August 5th, 2010, the mine collapses. There are 33 men trapped 2,300 feet below the surface. And 17 days later, on August 22nd, a drill from the surface finally pokes through the little space they're in. And they tape a note to the end of the drill and send it back up. And the note says, all 33 of us are fine in the shelter. How did they survive? They're sitting in literal, emotional, psychological darkness. They ran out of food. Even after extreme rationing, they'd run out of food. How did all 33 of them make it? They were not in the dark alone. They were in the dark with one another. And for another 52 days after contact, they were in the dark together while rescue plans were being put together. They had each other. That's how they made it. And they will never forget it, of course. Brothers and sisters, you are not alone in the valley. However dark, however close the danger may seem, however alone you think you are, down there in the depths with you is the Lord God, your shepherd. It's when we know this, it's when we know this that we can say that thing that is so important for us Christians to say, what David says here, I will fear no evil. It's the second time David declares something in light of who God is. First says, I will lack nothing. Now he says, I will fear no evil. These are the things that are granted us when we believe God is our shepherd, that we are able to say and live. Two reasons why David's able to say this, that he'll fear no evil. One, because David knows that the shadows of death are just shadows. Let me ask again, friends, what do you fear? What do you really hope doesn't happen to you? Now think, how many of those fears are actually likely to happen? How many of them will happen to the degree that you're afraid of them? Maybe you've even heard of these stats and studies. It turns out something like 91% of the things we're worried about never come true, never happen. However much of your thoughts are often about fear, however much of your thoughts are occupied with the things you're afraid of, imagine 91%, 91% of the things you're afraid of are going to have no life outside of your mind. They live and die up here. Even the 9% of things that will happen that you're afraid of, you don't know which ones. So it doesn't make sense to order your life around what you're afraid of. It's just another way to say what we all know, right? That life is more about learning how to live with the 100% of things that do happen that we do not imagine will. That's what life is. That's what you need a shepherd for. You don't know what's going to come to your life. You don't know. Charles Spurgeon said it like this, and he had some amazing accuracy. The shadow of a dog cannot bite. The shadow of a sword cannot kill. The shadow of death cannot destroy us. Let us not, therefore, be afraid. The worst evils of life are those which do not exist except in our imagination. If we had no troubles but real troubles, we should not have a tenth of our present sorrows. We can fear no evil because most of what we're afraid of is only in our minds. That's the first reason David can say that. Second reason, he can fear no evil and we can fear no evil because our shepherd is actually the most fearsome of all. Our shepherd is more fearsome than anything you're afraid of. So much like we can overly formalize God, right, and keep him kind of at a distance, don't really get to he's my shepherd, we can also overly familiarize him. He just becomes this big lovable buddy of ours. He's our shepherd but he's also the all-consuming fire. The Bible over and over again tells us that wisdom is what? The fear of the Lord. The Bible shows us over and over again that foolishness is to fear anything besides the Lord. And that's true because the Lord who is your shepherd is, for one example, also the Lord of the plagues. Remember those? Turned the Nile into blood, sent swarms of flies and frogs and locusts that nobody could hide from, killed all the livestock of Egypt, even sent all of Egypt into three days of pitch-black darkness. He said, I will bring a darkness to be felt. Imagine God saying that. You know you're going to feel it if God means it to be felt. The one who is with you in the darkness is the Lord over the darkness. He is the one who inflicts horrors on his enemies and laughs at them. He is the one who flattens cities and kingdoms out of love for his glory and his people. He is at total peace while being the nightmare to the unrighteous. Even the most fearsome on earth can only kill the body. He casts souls into hell. We can fear no evil for a God more fearsome than death is our shepherd. The verse ends here, verse 4, with David bringing these things kind of together. He uses these images familiar to shepherds of a rod and a staff. The rod was shorter, more like a club for striking predators, even or unruly sheep, punishing them, protecting them from punishing them, protecting them from wild animals. The staff was longer, a little more multi-purpose. It's for nudging them in the right direction, keeping them from running into each other, running off cliffs. It had a crook at the end so you could quickly grab a lamb from walking off a cliff or keep them still while you're like inspecting their body. The staff symbolized the fact that the shepherd also walked with the sheep that he was cared for. And together, the rod and staff, they show a complete picture of God's power and his care, his protection for his sheep. And what does David say? By his rod, by your rod and your staff, by his rod, by your rod and your staff, I am comforted. They comfort him. Friends, the experience of being one of God's sheep is comfort. The feeling that comes from knowing who God is to you is comfort. Have you felt this comfort? The comfort of knowing that the valley will still have provisions for you. The comfort of knowing that the shadows will stay put. The comfort that your shepherd runs from no one. The comfort that he is with you in the valley. He is with you in your valley. He is with you. This is all made all the more certain, isn't it? Because we know that when he takes us into the valley, into the valley of the shadow of death, he's leading us on a path that he himself has traveled. One commentator says, there in the valley of the shadow of death, all other guides turn back and the traveler must go alone. Only the Lord can lead a man through death. Only the Lord will lead a man through death. We can know Yahweh is with us in the valley, in the darkness that feels like death because Jesus, Yahweh incarnate, plunged into far deeper valleys himself and he did so alone. He didn't enter a valley with a shadow of death. He entered the valley of death. It's not that the cross is a little like the valley. It's that the valley is a little like the cross. And he walked through by himself, vulnerable, powerless, thirsty, like a lamb led not to green grass, but to slaughter, not for sins of his own, but ours. He died for sinners that God had every right to unleash his fearsomeness against, but instead sinners can now look at God and say, you are with me. Why? Because the Son walked through. Friends, do you want to believe that he is with you? You must first believe that he died for you. Do you believe that the Son of God died for you? That all your sins have been paid for and that that has comforted you more than anything in the world could comfort you? When that comforts you, then you can also be comforted that Jesus emerged from the valley. He entered the valley of death. He emerged the resurrection and the life. He emerged with the keys of Hades in his hands. And as Isaiah tells us, looking ahead in chapter 9, to us, upon all who have believed him, those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, of deep darkness, on them a light has shone. And as we've just sang earlier, this is what he did. He come to earth to taste our sadness, he whose glories knew no end. By his life, he brings us gladness, our redeemer, shepherd, and friend. Let's pray. Father, we thank you that we can claim these things because of what your Son has done for us. We can claim that you are our shepherd. We can claim that you are with us and that therefore we need fear nothing. Because he walked the fearsome, dark, lonely path for us and ahead of us. Father, we ask that you would show us and make clearer to us that even in the darkness, even in the valley where death feels like it's shading us, that you are in fact with us, that we are not alone. Use your word to brand that upon us, that we might in fact keep walking where you have brought us. Thank you for the hope that you will keep walking us until we are home. In Christ's name, amen.
