The sermon text for today is Genesis 27, verses 1 through 40. When Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim so that he could not see, he called Esau, his older son, and said to him, My son, and he answered, Here I am. He said, Behold, I am old. I do not know the day of my death. Now then, take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me. And prepare for me delicious food, such as I love, and bring it to me so that I may eat, that my soul may bless you before I die. Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game and bring it, Rebekah said to her son Jacob, I heard your father speak to your brother Esau. Bring me game and prepare for me delicious food, that I may eat it and bless you before the Lord before I die. Now therefore, my son, obey my voice as I command you. Go to the flock and bring me two good young goats, so that I may prepare from them delicious food for your father, such as he loves. And you shall bring it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before he dies. But Jacob said to Rebekah, his mother, behold, my brother Esau is a hairy man and I am a smooth man. Perhaps my father will feel me and I shall seem to be mocking him and bring a curse upon myself and not a blessing. His mother said to him, let your curse be on me, my son. Only obey my voice and go bring them to me. So he went and took them and brought them to his mother and his mother prepared delicious food such as his father loved. Then Rebekah took the best garments of Esau, her older son, which were with her in the house and put them on Jacob, her younger son. And the skins of the young goats she put on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck. And she put the delicious food and the bread, which she had prepared into the hand of her son Jacob. So he went into his father and said, my father, and he said, here I am. Who are you? My son, Jacob said to his father, I am Esau, your firstborn. I've done as you told me now sit up and eat of my game that your soul may bless me. But Isaac said to his son, how is it that you have found it so quickly, my son? He answered, because the Lord, your God granted me success. Then Isaac said to Jacob, please come near that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you are really my son Esau or not. So Jacob went near to Isaac, his father, who felt him and said, the voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau. And he did not recognize him because his hands were hairy like his brother's Esau's hands. So he blessed him. He said, are you really my son Esau? He answered, I am. Then he said, bring it near to me that I may eat of my son's game and bless you. So he brought it near to him and he ate and he brought him wine and he drank. Then his father Isaac said to him, come near and kiss me, my son. So he came near and kissed him and Isaac smelled the smell of his garments and blessed him and said, see the smell of my son is as the smell of a field that the Lord has blessed. May God give you of the dew of heaven and of the fatness of the earth and plenty of grain and wine. Let people serve you and nations bow down to you. Be Lord over your brothers and may your mother's sons bow down to you. Blessed be everyone who curses you and blessed be everyone who blesses you. As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, when Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac, his father, Esau, his brother came in from his hunting. He also prepared delicious food and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, let my father arise and eat of his son's game that you may bless me. His father Isaac said to him, who are you? He answered, I am your son, your firstborn Esau. Then Isaac trembled very violently and said, who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me and I ate it all before you came and I have blessed him. Yes, and he shall be blessed. As soon as Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry and said to his father, bless me, even me also, oh my father. But he said, your brother came deceitfully and he has taken away your blessing. Esau said, is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has cheated me these two times. He took away my birthright and behold, now he has taken away my blessing. Then he said, have you not reserved a blessing for me? Isaac answered and said to Esau, behold, I have made him Lord over you and all his brothers I have given to him for servants and with grain and wine I have sustained him. What then can I do for you, my son? Esau said to his father, have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, oh my father. And Esau lifted up his voice and wept. Then Isaac, his father answered and said to him, behold, away from the fatness of the earth shall your dwelling be and away from the dew of the heaven on high. By your sword you shall live and you shall serve your brother. But when you grow restless, you shall break his yoke from your neck, says the word of the Lord. A little question for you, a trivia. If you want to make it on television as a family, how do you do it? If you want to make it to the big time, have your own show, as a family, not you, superstar you, as an entire family, how do you make it on television as a family? There's a recipe. I don't know if you know this, there's one secret sauce. Do you know what it is to make it on television? You have to be crazy dysfunctional. Think about a family whose lives become reality television. Think about your favorite families from fictional television. What do they all have in common? They're all dysfunctional. Nobody wants to watch a normal, quiet family who all respect each other and who get along and honor each other. How boring would that be? Nobody would ever watch that. We want war. We want manipulative mothers and juvenile fathers. We want children who run their families. We want honey boo boo. I've never seen that, but I do have Google. Think about it, even the good, clean families who get their own shows, John and Kate plus eight, remember that? Turned out to be John and Kate plus 12, as John had like four different mistresses. He was dating on the side, the Duggars, I'm not even going to speak about the Duggars, but my goodness, that was the one shining hope for us all. And that's just how we want it. Sick as that may be, sick as we must be, everybody loves a good dysfunctional family, unless of course you came from one. This morning we encounter maybe the most dysfunctional family in all the Bible, in Isaac's family, a father, Isaac, and a mother, Rebecca, with competing agendas about their different favorite sons. And their two sons, Esau, the first born, impulsive, irrational, emotive son, and Jacob, the second born, calculating, manipulative son. Isaac, we saw last week, Moses zoomed back out and back in time to show us that Isaac, father Isaac, still has Abraham's blessing. So people, place, blessing, Abraham's blessing, from all the way back in Genesis 12 and beyond, it's been building, snowballing, it's still alive, and it's now come to Isaac. Before the two sons were born, it was prophesied that the older son, Esau, shall serve the younger son, Jacob. That's already been prophesied. Jacob, we've already seen, has already stolen away the birthright from Esau, he cheated him with food. And so we come to Genesis 27. If you're not there, I invite you to turn in your Bible to Genesis chapter 27, first book in your Bible. I'll actually pick up by reading the final two verses in 26, which I preached from Genesis 26 last week, but I left these final two verses along because they're really a cliffhanger, a hinge between 26 and what's about to happen in 27. Look at Genesis 26, verse 34, when Esau was 40 years old, he took Judith, the daughter of Beeri, the Hittite, to be his wife, and Besma, I don't know how to pronounce that, I actually knew a girl in Oklahoma named, and I can't remember how she pronounced her name, but this was her name, the daughter of Elon, the Hittite, and they made life bitter for Isaac and Rebekah. So you can see a little sign of things to come, a little ominous cliffhanger as Moses transitions into the events of our chapter this morning, verse one of chapter 27. This morning we enter into the family tent where all this building tension comes to a head, and it is indeed must-see TV, and for all the wrong reasons. So let's tune in, and let me walk you through this passage by introducing you to each of the four dysfunctional characters, beginning first with Isaac the weak. Isaac the weak, chapter 27, verse one reads, when Isaac was old and his eyes were dim, so that he could no longer see, he called Esau, his older brother, his older son rather, and said to him, my son, and he answered, here I am. So Isaac is an old man now, we've jumped forward in time, he's probably, if you do the math from Genesis, he's probably around 130 years old, and he's basically blind. He's also weak, incredibly weak, and weak in more ways than one. If you look down at verse 19, when Jacob comes to Isaac, Jacob says to Isaac, sit up and eat, which seems to indicate that Isaac is bedridden. So he's old, he's very sickly, my mind goes to Grandpa Joe and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, except Isaac, in the book of Genesis, never recovers his youth and springs to his feet. But Jacob's biggest weakness is his preference for his firstborn son, Esau, which seems to be largely driven by his own appetite. I wonder if you noticed this, this is something that Moses has been developing over the last few chapters of Genesis. Back in 25, verse 28, Moses commented that Isaac loved Esau, why? Because he ate of his game. But Rebekah loved Jacob. In verse 4 of our chapter this morning, we read Isaac saying, prepare for me delicious food such as I love. Three times in the chapter today, Isaac's love for delicious food and wild game is reiterated. If Esau is a character entirely driven by his own impulses, by his own appetite, then it seems he got it from his father. And as I observed last week, sometimes the sins of a father reappear and reappear much worse in their sons. What a sad thing, if I could just comment as an aside, what a sad thing, what a purely selfish thing to prefer a child for delicious food, for his hunting, for his baseball talent, for her intelligence. What a sad thing. Isaac invites Esau into his tent to send him then out into the field to do what he did best to hunt wild game with his bow, to turn it into for Papa, a favorite feast, all to provide the perfect occasion for Isaac to pass on to Esau the blessing. Look at verse 4, prepare for me delicious food such as I love and bring it to me so that I may eat so that my soul may bless you before I die. Now remember, you already know, as you've been reading through Genesis, you already know that Isaac knows just like Rebekah knows that prophecy from chapter 25 where God himself had said, while both children were still in the womb, chapter 25, verse 23, the Lord said to Rebekah, two nations are in your womb and two peoples from within you shall be divided. The one shall be stronger than the other, and here it is, the surprise, the prophecy, the older shall serve the younger. So you already know that, I already know that from Genesis 25, and you also know whether Isaac knows it or not, we're not sure, but you know, I know that Esau has already forfeited his birthright, which secures privilege and really the very blessing that Isaac here is offering at the end of his life, it's already, it should be secured for Jacob, Esau gave it up for a meal when he was hungry, and yet in spite of all that, Isaac, dad, ignores God's word and still stubbornly tries to force this blessing to his firstborn and preferred son Esau in exchange for a meal no less. This story is laced with sad, tragic irony. Just like son gave up the birthright for a meal, now Esau is going to reiterate, rehash all this because of his father's love for wild food, and how often do we do the same thing in ignoring God's clear word the moment it conflicts with our desires? In many ways, our allegiance to God and our submission to God's word, in many ways, that's not really tested or really proven until God's word actually disagrees with our plans and our preferences. Then we know when this disagrees with this, with this, then we know where our allegiance is really lie, then we know who really is king of our lives. Old age can be a crowning time, the crowning years of wisdom, it should be if you read the Proverbs, or it can just as easily, more easily in fact, become a glorious display of stubbornness as we become entirely set in our own ways, unbudgeable in our preferences, and just too old to care about hiding it anymore. We've all seen it, we all will go that way in old age if we ease up and if we don't end our lives striving in and by the spirit for grace and for more grace just as we have in our earlier years. Second character I want to introduce you to is Rebecca, the conniving. Rebecca, the conniving, mama. Sitting quietly and listening intently in the room next to Isaac's is Isaac's wife, Rebecca. This tent, luxurious as it no doubt was according to the standards of the day, remember Isaac just like his dad, Abraham, is rich, even still it's a tent, and I don't know that much about ancient near eastern tents, but I know that the walls aren't that thick, and so Rebecca overhears Isaac's plans and immediately calls on Isaac, who I have no doubt was in the basement playing computer games, and unhatches a plan of her own. Look at verse eight. Now therefore my son, obey my voice as I command you. Go to the flock and bring me two young good goats so that I may prepare from them delicious food for your father such as he loves. And you shall bring it to your father to eat so that he may bless you before he dies. Jacob remember is the smart child, so he immediately spots the flaw in Rebecca's plan. Look at verse 11. Mom, Esau is a hairy man. I am a smooth man. Dad could easily find that out, and if he does, Jacob says in verse 12, I could be cursed. Deuteronomy 27, 18 says, cursed, cursed be anyone, anathema, be anyone who misleads a blind man on the road. This is a no fly zone, and Jacob knows it. Rebecca, however, resolute and fearless, responds in verse 13, let your curse be upon me, my son. Only you obey my voice. This is a high stakes game of poker. It curses, death, damnation, all potentially on the line, and Rebecca risks it all for the sake of this blessing going to her preferred son, mama's boy, even now into his 70s, Jacob. Rebecca is conniving and selfish, and if Esau is a warped mirror image of Isaac, then Jacob is a warped mirror image of Rebecca. He's selfish and conniving just like she is, only he's, as we see, 10 times worse. Mothers really do tend to set the temperature of a home for better and for worse. If mama ain't happy, nobody's happy. It's a cliche and an adage, but like most adages, it has more than a hint of truth to it. That's why we smile at those adages, at least when mama ain't looking. Of course, Isaac should have led his home better, perhaps he's even most responsible, we might say, for the state, the sad state, the dysfunctional state of his home, but Rebecca, beautiful Rebecca, has nurtured a home of rivalry and deceit, a home where moms are spying on dads and then crafting lying schemes for her favorite son to cheat her husband and his father, nurtured a house divided against itself, which will not stand. This is reality television, and Rebecca is must-see TV for all the wrong reasons. Isaac and Rebecca are co-conspirators here. Isaac brings two young goats to Rebecca, who skins them and turns them into a delicious meal. This is a cooking family. Rebecca then went into Esau's closet, took two of his finest coats, and put them on her son, Jacob. Lastly, she took the two goat skins and draped them around Jacob's exposed areas, his neck, his hands, so that all their bases were covered. We can only imagine, by the way, how ridiculous Jacob must have looked here. If only Isaac could see, he surely would have immediately laughed. But Isaac can't see anymore, and so he can't see that beneath the goat skin and beneath the coats, no doubt two sizes too big, is a cheat. Let me introduce you thirdly to Jacob the cheat. Jacob the cheat. Jacob enters into his father's room in this large tent with all his bases covered except two. There's two things he can't control in this ruse. First of all, he cannot control his voice. We can deepen our voices or soften them, but at the end of the day, you know, I sound like a pterodactyl, you sound like what you sound like, and there's just only so much we can do about our voices. In the scenes that follow, you can see Isaac teetering back and forth between acceptance of the words that are spoken to him and disbelief largely on account of the voice. It just doesn't add up. The second thing that Jacob has zero control over is Esau's return. He could return at any moment, and Jacob has no idea how blessed he will be in hunting his game. So on both accounts, Jacob is just going to have to risk it along with Rebekah as he enters into his father's room. Look at verse 18. So he went into his father's room and he said, my father, and he said, Isaac said, here I am. Who are you, my son? Jacob said to his father, I am Esau, your firstborn. I've done as you told me. Now sit up and eat of my game that your soul may bless me. Isaac you can see is immediately confused. How did, how did, how did Jacob get, how did Esau get back so quickly with a meal already prepared and the voice, something is, something is off here. And so he called the visitor claiming to be Esau, called him closer to feel him, to touch him and see if it really is Esau. This was his favorite son, remember. And from the moment his favorite son was born, he had one distinctive feature out of the womb for which Isaac and Rebekah had literally named him. They named him Esau, which means hairy. He came out like a patch of wool. He was a, he was a hairy little baby and he was a hairy grown man. And so when sight and hearing both fail the old man, he calls his, his boy close to feel him. I imagine things are eerily quiet in this moment. Jacob waiting to see if his haywire plan is going to work or flop in his face. Wondering if he's going to be cursed, wondering how good mom's costume really was. Wondering how similar goat hair was to Esau's hair. In verse 22, you can feel Isaac's confusion when he says, the voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are Esau's hands. It's always fun to watch somebody step into a trap and you know the trick, you know it's a trap, but they don't. And so you just sit there watching and disbelief feels so obvious. How, how are they, how did he miss this? The voice I did a few weeks ago in our equipping class, just before the service, I did a heresy quiz. Uh, we're teaching on the early church and it's wrestling with competing teachings and it's understanding of heresy. And so for our class on heresies, I did a heresy quiz and before I debuted it on Sunday morning for many of you, I sent it to my family first, a few days before, because it's good from time to time to remind your family that you're better than them. And so I sent my family, my mom, my dad, my brothers, my sister-in-laws, uh, the quiz 10, 15 questions, something like that. But I forgot I had the correct answers still written true or false in the margins. And so my brother, my oldest brother texts back great quiz, he calls me rat great quiz rat. A few of them were tricky, but I got them all right. Then Sunday morning I gave the same quiz to around 70 people this time without the answers in the margin. And to my knowledge, correct me if I'm wrong about this after the service or honestly for your own humility, do not correct me on this and just remain anonymously brilliant. But to my knowledge, not a single person got every single question correct. We're all heretics. Turns out maybe having the answers there in the margin helps us a little bit. Yeah. Or my oldest brother is a genius. It just feels so obvious watching this unfold that Esau is Jacob here. How could Isaac miss this? The voice, Isaac, that food came out of the kitchen way too fast, Isaac. Isaac deliberates in verse 23, he's confused, but the touch and the smell match the claims match the words. He seemingly takes the bait in verse 23 when we read. So he blessed him, huge pregnant pause here, but then immediately one last time he hesitates again. It's still not adding up. There's a dissonance in his mind. And he says in verse 24, are you really one last time? Are you really my son Esau? Jacob gives the lie one last time. And this is the final time because Isaac here accepts the distorted reality, accepts the lie for true. And he invites Esau, who is really Jacob, close for the sacred ceremony, which ensues in verse 26. Then his father, Isaac said to him, come near and kiss me, my son. And so Jacob came near and kissed his father. I can't help but to note here the deception, an act of utter betrayal here by a kiss. You almost can't help but to think of Judas here as you watch Jacob. And just like that, with a kiss, a most holy song ensues as Isaac begins his blessing for his son. If you look at the indentation in your Bible beginning the blessing in verse 27, that's telling you that this blessing is given as a sacred poem or song here. Isaac breaks out in song and the song goes like this. I'm not going to sing it, but here are the lyrics. See the smell of my son is as the smell of a field that the Lord has blessed. May God give you the dew of heaven and the fatness of the earth and plenty of grain and wine. Let the peoples serve you and nations bow down to you. Be Lord over your brothers and may your mother's sons bow down to you. Cursed be everyone who curses you and blessed be everyone who blesses you in song. The blessing feels so foreign to us, but I wonder, at least for those of you who've been on this long journey through Genesis, I wonder if this strange blessing rings some bells from our journey through Genesis. It contains three basic parts, the blessing. Notice the first part, may God give you the dew of heaven and the fatness of earth with plenty of grain and wine. So all the best of heaven and earth, Isaac is praying, grain and wine, those are images in the Bible of abundance, abundant times, wealth. May that all be yours, Jacob. Secondly, second part of the blessing, let the people serve you and nations bow down to you. Be Lord over your brothers and may your mother's sons bow down to you. So you have brothers, peoples, nations all bowing down before Jacob. Isaac is praying, not knowing he's praying for Jacob. Remember the prophecy from 25-23, the older shall serve the younger, it's now coming true. The father is unwittingly, in spite of what he wants to do, praying it, blessing it as true. Third part of the blessing, cursed be everyone who curses you and blessed be everyone who blesses you. Everyone, Jacob, everyone who aligns with you will be blessed. Everyone who's against you, who strives against you will be cursed. That's straight out of Genesis 12. Do you recognize that? And God's original blessing to Abraham, this is the foundation of the Abrahamic covenant. Abraham's blessing is now being rehearsed and passed on to Isaac. Remember we saw last week, it's still alive. Isaac has the blessing. All those original big promises God made to Abraham are still alive and now they're passed down to Jacob. Of course, if you sing that song that Jacob, that Isaac rather sings here, if you sing it to a, this blessing to a slightly different tune, it sounds different. It sounds like this. Listen carefully. People serving you from every nation, people, the dew of heaven and the fatness of the earth. The word there is the same word for land, place. Cursed is everyone who curses you and blessed is everyone who blesses you. Blessing, people, place, blessing. You see all those big promises God made to Abraham, they're still alive and they're all here transferred to Esau, who is really Jacob. Of all the dysfunctional characters in this horribly dysfunctional home, I think Jacob by far comes off the worst. The lies just roll off. How easily he lies, how naturally he lies. In verse 20, Isaac is on to him and so Isaac says, how'd you kill and cook that so fast, my son? Look how quickly Isaac responds and how deceptively when he says, because the Lord, your God has granted me success, he invokes the name of his father's God to manipulate his own father to cover his own tracks. This is blasphemous. And he does all of this, oh man, he does all of this to his weak, vulnerable, aging father. Is there anything more despicable in our world than those who prey upon the most vulnerable? Grownups who abuse children and right alongside them, those who take advantage of and scam the elderly. Is there anything more despicable in all the earth? And that's exactly who Jacob is here and that's exactly who Jacob has always been. He acts here in accordance with his nature. If I could give a brief word to the children in the room and of course to us adults as well, always tell the truth and be careful not to lie. Because there may not be, it's not just that lying is bad, that's true. God doesn't want us to lie, but it's even more than that. There may not be a more difficult habit in all the world to break than the habit of lying. All sin is deceptive, all sin can overtake us, but lying in particular has a unique power to consume us so that before long, giving ourselves to a few lies, we ourselves believe the lies, we ourselves become the lies. Some people are so given over to their sin and their deceit, they're lying, but they can no longer see the truth from error and I want to say there may be no more grave condition than to no longer be able to see true from lie. If there's anything good we can observe here in Jacob and by my eye, there's just one thing. It's his regard for the blessing. Even if it was entirely selfishly motivated, and it was, even still from the time that Jacob was born, he seemed to grasp what this blessing meant and made his life about taking it away from Esau. Let me be clear, he was wrong in every way that he did this, do not misunderstand, but he at least saw the worth of God's blessing, whereas Esau would give it up in a moment for just one meal. And so Esau is said to have despised his birthright. Jacob here reminds me in some weird ways of some of my greatest childhood heroes who were and are all-time great sports icons. Michael Jordan, unquestionably the greatest basketball player of all time. Anybody who says otherwise literally does not deserve to ever be listened to again. Tiger Woods, probably the greatest golfer of all time, certainly the most talented golfer of all time. Both made it, not to the top, not to elite status, but to the very top, to the peak of their sport, not as superstars, but both as potentially the greatest ever, and both made it there, we eventually learn, by basically being complete wrecks as they climbed their way to the top and destroying everybody in their paths. Their personal lives were wrecks, their marriages were busted, their teammates and their peers often hated them because that's what it took. That's the level of sold-out, total commitment it took and it takes to become the greatest ever. That's Jacob. He lies, he cheats, he steals, his own brother becomes his worst enemy, his own aging father he betrays with a kiss, and he comes out the other side with a blessing no matter what it took. That leaves one final scene and one final character to us and for our story, and that of course is Esau the Bitter, Esau the Bitter. We've all seen a hundred shows or read a dozen books where the main character or one of the good guys sneaks into the home or to the office of the villain, of the bad guy, in order to find something important, some clues, some piece of information, and the show at this point usually splits back and forth between the good guy who's in this precarious situation in the bad guy's home office and he's downloading the files and it's at 80% and 87% and then it pans the screen and you see the villain who's just walking at a brisk pace and he gets right up to the door and oh my gosh, he's going to find them, and then usually the villain stops to check the mail or a hummingbird catches his attention and he pauses for just a moment and then he opens up the door and the good guy's gone, made it out just in the nick of time. That's exactly how Moses writes this story, did you notice? Of Jacob and Esau, verse 30, as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, when Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, do you feel that suspense? He made it out by a moment. Esau, his brother, came in from his hunting. He also, Esau also, prepared delicious food and brought it to his father and he said to his father, let my father arise and eat of his son's game so that you may bless me. Esau killed his prey, Esau cooked his meal, he lost the birthright before, he's not going to blow this second chance, he somehow has by his father's insistence, so he comes to his father with a feast and he asks for his blessing, you can imagine in this moment Isaac's initial confusion, which slowly turns from confusion into something else. Verse 32, his father Isaac said to him, who are you? And he answered, I'm your son, your firstborn son, Esau, in an instant, Isaac's blindness to reality is removed and he sees all the twisted things we've been watching at his expense for the previous 30 verses. Verse 33 says that Isaac trembled very violently, the old, weak, blind, and bedridden man violently trembles here, his voice trembles, his body convulses, he asks rhetorically, who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me and I ate before you came? He does not await an answer because he's not searching for an answer, he's informing Esau by his question of this awful news because he knows the answer, he already knows because he knows his other son too, even if he's not his favorite, he knows his nature, he knows that he's a lying cheat and he immediately realized that this time it was at his own expense and this awful moment, verse 36, Esau gives to Jacob, his brother, the fuller meaning of his name, Harry and Heel, you'll remember they were born, but Heel is now further twisted to cheat, Jacob the cheat, Esau learns what has happened and in verse 34 we read that he cries out, the word there is literally he screamed, I'm not gonna do it, but he screamed with a great and bitter scream and he begs his father, look how he begs his father for another blessing, verse 34, bless me too, oh my father, verse 36, don't you have any blessing left for me, Isaac tells him, I've made him your lord, my son, it just keeps getting worse and worse for Esau, have you not but one blessing, my father, verse 38 says, bless me, even me also, oh my father, his final plea, he makes in verse 38 and so Jacob sits up once more for one final sacred ceremony and out of old weak Jacob's mouth comes a second song, a second poem, a second blessing, if you can even call it that, it's not like the first blessing at all, actually it's like the reverse of the first one, it really is an anti-blessing, verse 39, behold, away from the fatness of the earth shall your dwelling be and away from the dew of heaven on high, by your sword you shall live, you remember Ishmael, sent away to live by violence and by conflict and by sword, so to Esau, by your sword you shall live and you shall serve your brother but when you grow restless, you shall break his yoke from your neck, Esau effectively is cursed here, away from the land, the blessed land, to a life of war, not peace, a life, a life awfully of bowing down to his cheater brother, his only consolation, if you could even call it that, at some point Isaac sings in his suffering, Esau will break free from Joseph, at least for a time, what's done is done, Isaac has no authority to revoke this blessing, he's already given much as he might like to and Isaac knows it because Isaac knows that God was here and God oversaw this, in act, in scene, in play, what a story, what a family, what in the world are you supposed to take from this and I, what am I supposed to take from this, how in the world can this help us in this life besides giving us a little more cringy entertainment, is there anything here for us to help us in our lives, I'd like to conclude this morning by reopening up the curtains and bringing each of the characters back on the stage just for one brief moment to look at them one last time and give one final word on each of them for you and for me, so first let's bring back out both Jacob and Rebecca together so we can discuss for just a moment their lying schemes one last time, one very obvious way you could misread this story is to just sort of whitewash Jacob and Rebecca, it's tempting because he does get the blessing which just makes no sense to us in light of what seems obvious, namely he's a lying cheat, he's a scoundrel, how could God bless him, well let me be clear, he was wrong, he was horribly wrong, she was wrong, they both were wrong, and it did not have to be this way, just like Isaac in the famine did not have to flee, just like Abraham before him and the famine did not have to flee but could have stood there and waited by faith, trusted in the promises of God for blessing, so too Jacob and Rebecca had God's word, they had the prophecy, they could have believed, they could have waited, they could have trusted, not knowing how God's gonna do it but banking that God is gonna do it, and let me say further, there were grave consequences for their sins here, they're not recounted here in chapter 27, but as the story continues, grave consequences for Isaac and Rebecca for their sins here, Rebecca and Jacob here represent all those who insist on taking God's work into their own hands, Esau and Jacob are estranged enemies for most of the rest of their lives from here forward, how tragic, Jacob's life from this moment forward became the life of an exile as he fled home to flee Esau, Rebecca would never see her son, her favorite son again for the rest of her life after this moment, it did not have to be this way, there were awful consequences, this is what happens when we, when you, when I insist on taking God's word into our own hands and going out ahead of God so to speak, they were fools and they live with their decisions, friends, wait upon the Lord, let God be God, bank your life on his word, on his promises, don't cut corners, don't cheat in life and don't ever think you can cheat your way through life to blessing without consequences, God rules, God sees it all. Second, let's bring back out Isaac and I want to discuss for just a moment his trembling, verse 33 says, Isaac trembled very violently, no doubt there's anguish here, no doubt there's anger here, his mind trembles, his body trembles, but I wonder if there was something more to that violent trembling, in the trembling of Isaac's soul, you see how verse 33 begins with his trembling but it ends with Isaac's relenting and saying yes and Jacob shall be blessed, finally it seems, finally Isaac yields here after trembling to the will of God and to the word of God and finally gives the blessing to Jacob which is what God so clearly intended all along, in this moment where he trembled, was this his faith, was this Isaac finally believing his father's God, exercising faith just like his father did in this moment, I don't know for sure but here's what I do know and I still cannot believe this is true, Isaac's legacy in the Bible is given to us, the final word on Isaac is given to us in Hebrews 11, as so many of the other characters in Genesis, we get the final word, the postscript on them, the summary of them in Hebrews 11 and in a little bit in Hebrews 12 and here's what Hebrews 11 20 says of Isaac, Isaac by faith, Isaac invoked future blessings on Jacob and Esau period, that's it, are you kidding me, that's what Isaac got in Hebrews, it's short, it's one line, father Abraham got a full robust supple paragraph, Isaac gets but one short sentence but his legacy goes down in Hebrews as faith, how is that possible, what is God thinking here, is Isaac just whitewashed by the author of Hebrews, forced into a good hat, crammed into a good guy, no, Hebrews looks at Genesis and looks at Isaac and what Hebrews sees is faith and faith in the Bible attaches anyone, any scoundrel, any cheat, anyone, attaches anyone to Christ, to his life, to his death, to his resurrection, so that our sins become covered as we exercise faith, as we receive, our sins become covered by the blood of the land and so that his righteousness becomes our garments, he's not, Isaac's not whitewashed, he's blood washed, just like you and I will be if we only trust in Christ. Third, let's bring back out Esau for a final word on his bitterness, again Hebrews gives us the final word on Esau in the next chapter, Hebrews chapter 12, I read it a couple of weeks ago, let me read for you just briefly again, Hebrews 12, final assessment of Esau, strive, Hebrews 12 14 says, strive for peace with everyone and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord, see to it that no one fails to obtain the grace of God, see to it that no root of bitterness springs up and causes trouble and by it many become defiled, see to it that no one is sexually immoral or unholy like Esau who sold his birthright for a single meal, you know that afterward when he desired to inherit the blessing, Hebrews is talking about our chapter right now, you know that afterwards when he desired to inherit the blessing he was rejected, Esau was rejected for he found no chance to repent though he sought it with tears, in verse 34 of our passage Esau screamed out in bitterness, Hebrews tells us as does Genesis that he was bitter until the very end and Esau never repented, he was sorrowful, he was sad, he cried, he moaned, he screamed, you can feel that in this passage, I wonder how many of you reading this passage are tempted to feel sorry for Esau just like I am but that's not how Moses wants us to see him, he had what Paul calls a worldly sorrow motivated by selfishness, motivated by what he lost, he had no godly repentance, listen if you hear the word of God and if any piece of you is open to it or believes it, you must receive it and you must respond to it now and by faith, do not assume that you will always have tomorrow, of course in the first place you're not promised another day but also what you don't realize is that when you refuse the word of God, your heart becomes further hardened and bitterness can easily take root in and bitterness can easily take root in you and take over your heart just like it did Esau. Finally, I want to bring out just one more time, really the star of our dysfunctional awful show this morning in Jacob, this time all alone and for one final word on that blessing. So the scoundrel leaves the chapter and lives the rest of his life with God's blessing, it's the most difficult part of this passage by far, how did he get it, how could God give it to him, how could God stand for this, I am sure that many of you feel that. I'm also sure that if you or I were somehow allowed special access, like imagine if our heads just got to pop over or whatever that looks like and into heaven right now and we got to somehow see, pan, God allowed us in the spirit like John in the apocalypse that ends the Bible, the revelation, and we're allowed to see everybody who is there, so we got to see who made it. I am so sure that one of our reactions would be to be scandalized. He made it? What? There's no way, there's no chance God let her in. And I'm sure this would be one of our reactions because this is a consistent theme running throughout the entire Bible, Jesus Christ befriended sinners. Jesus declared righteous, not religious preachers and pharisees, but Jesus declared as righteous, vile, cheating tax collectors. Jesus welcomed into paradise the thief on the cross beside him who never did a single good work and knew zero theology. And all through Genesis and all through Genesis and all through the rest of the Bible, scoundrels just like Jacob inherit the blessing of God and the kingdom of God. The pharisees and religious leaders of the world, all the Esau's of this world, all the older brothers of this world will always be incensed by this and scandalized by this, but my friends, this scandal, this is the scandal of the gospel and the point of the gospel. The gospel is not God is searching out from heaven for all the good guys and the good girls and maybe just boosting them a little bit and now bringing them into heaven. That's what you want it to be. That's what I wanted it to be before I understood the gospel because we all just want to be chosen for our talent because we all had a little more potential, a little more bit of the credit than goes to us. That's what we want, but that's not the story of the Bible. That's not the gospel. And that's actually wonderful news for you because there were no good guys for God to search and find out. There were only scoundrels, only liars, only older brothers and younger brothers and cheats. There's only dysfunction in all the world and in every family, but thank God there's a God sovereignly working his gracious ways behind the scenes to pass on the blessing, to understand the blessing, to undeserving wretches and accomplish his purposes. That's actually the best news for you if you follow Christ this morning, if you'll trust in Christ even right now, and that's your, my, anybody's only hope for heaven. God, thank you for uncomfortable passages like this, which explode assumptions in our minds and blow up every last little bit of us that wants to hang on to some semblance of self-righteousness, some little bit of merit or credit that we earn on our own. God, thank you for the clarity of your word that Christ and Christ alone is righteous and that only those who trust in your promises and for us trust and receive your blessed promise of Christ the Savior for sins, only those receive from him what we could never earn on our own, and every one of those, every one of us, receive the fullness of what he earned, righteousness for you. So God, point, we pray, our hearts even more still to Christ, and these things we pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
