Matthew 28, 16 through 20. Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them. And when they saw him, they worshipped him, but some doubted. And Jesus came and said to them, All authority on heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always to the end of the age. This is the word of the Lord. In March of 2003, President Bush ordered the United States to invade Iraq. Within three weeks, the Iraqi government and Iraqi military had both collapsed. By December of the same year, Saddam Hussein had been captured by United States military. Over, right? Easy enough, all within a year. Wrong. The Iraqi insurgents, now without any leader, now without any commanding officer, now without any real authority, they improvised. There were ambushes from civilians, grenades, IEDs, if you remember that, cell phones and garage door openers and batteries all turned into homemade explosives. These scattered bands of insurgents took out American troops and even tanks and ensured that the Iraqi war would continue until 2011, eight more years, all without any leader or authority and against a much stronger and more powerful United States Army. This is guerrilla warfare. No rules, no real authority, but deadly, dangerous if not taken seriously. If you have your Bible, turn with me to Matthew chapter 28. Matthew chapter 28, that is towards the back of your Bible, in fact, it's the first book in the New Testament. If you're here this morning and you don't have a Bible, we have lots of Bibles for free to give to you just outside those double doors. You're free to go grab one at any point during the service. You're also free to grab one on your way out and take home with you and keep. That's our gift to you. We believe that the Bible is God's Word and is life-giving. And Matthew 28 this morning, which Linnea just read for us, Jesus has just died and risen from the dead, two things he told his disciples were going to happen, and he told them after his resurrection to meet him at a certain mountain in Galilee. Two things are significant about meeting at this mountain of Galilee. First of all, Jesus told them multiple times, meet me there after I die and after I rise again. Secondly, Galilee, just a little side note, just a footnote, Galilee is often known in the Bible, beginning in Isaiah, as Galilee of the Gentiles. That matters, especially in light of what we're going to consider over these famous words of Jesus in the coming weeks. So Jesus arranges for his disciples to meet him on this mountain of Galilee. There are now 11 disciples, Judas, who betrayed Jesus for 30 pieces of silver, has now given the money back and hung himself. And so the 11 who remain find Jesus at the prearranged hideout. And then we read in verse 17, look at your Bibles, Matthew 28, verse 17, we read that when they saw him, they worshiped him, but some doubted. What? I wonder if that struck you, how strange those words are. They saw him, him who they confessed as Lord, him who told them that he was going to die, him who told them that he was going to then raise from the dead three days later. They're now seeing him alive after the dead, after he's been raised from the dead, and they worshiped him, but we read some doubted. This is one of those verses that interpreters look at and they don't know what to do with it and so multiple theories arrive. Some people say that the them must be the crowds who are still hanging around, so the disciples worshiped when the 11 disciples were left, but the crowds, some of them still doubted and then maybe they disappeared and dissipated. Others look at this verse and that strange phrase and say, maybe there's some sense of doubted beyond the obvious, so maybe it doesn't mean what it looks like it means. Friends, I want to tell you, I think it means exactly what it sounds like. The 11 disciples saw him, they worshiped him, but some of them doubted him. It's the same word doubt. It's the same word that Jesus spoke earlier to Peter. When you remember, Peter walked on the water, but then became afraid and sank into the water. Jesus took him by the hand in the water and said to him, oh, you of little faith, why did you doubt? Same word. How could they doubt at this point? How are they still doubting? He's been raised from the dead. They see him raised from the dead. What sense does this even make? Their doubt. Well, if you've read the Gospels, it makes perfect sense. Leaving all to follow him and then entirely misunderstanding him again and again and again. I'll never deny you, even if all the others fall away, and then denying him three times before the morning. This is the consistent picture of the disciples. And you know what? In a way, I'm thankful that it is, and perhaps you should be too if you're a follower of Jesus, because as followers of Jesus, don't you too know this doubt? Worshiping but then wandering. In awe of the king of kings and then forgetting he exists five seconds later. Lord, I believe, but help my unbelief. I love the disciples because they're such a bag of mixed nuts, just like us. They are us. We are them. And so, Lord, help them, Lord, help us, Lord, please speak to them, and please speak to us. In verse 18, Jesus opens up his mouth and speaks to them and speaks to us with some of the most famous words ever spoken in human history. This is, if you're new to the Bible, this is a wonderful Sunday morning for you to be here because this is a high point and really climax in the story of the Bible. The disciples don't say a word here. I want you to notice these famous words, the great commission, Matthew 28, 18 through 20. The disciples don't say a word here because now is not the time. Time is limited. Jesus is about to ascend to his father. He has just a few words left for them. Now is the time for silence. Now is the time to listen and obey. And friends, may we follow suit this morning before these famous last words of the Lord Jesus to his disciples. This is the great commission in verses 18 through 20, and I want to spend the next three weeks looking at the great commission in full and looking at, in turn, each of its three different parts because, well, for lots of reasons, but next week we celebrate our five-year anniversary as a church. Glory to God. And I want to look at this famous passage, critical passage, high point of the Bible because I want to reorient us in a way and reground us in the amazing radical mission that Jesus has given to his disciples, then and now to all of us. The great commission has three parts to it. You might have noticed as you've looked at it in the past perhaps. First, it begins with a radical claim in verse 18. Second, it has a radical mission in verse 19. And third, it concludes with a radical promise in verse 20. That's the outline not for this morning but for the next three weeks. I want to look at each on its own fully and see what we've got after we've put it all together. So this morning I want to look at verse 18 and this radical claim beginning the great commission. I'm going to preach, I think maybe for the first time for me, a one-point sermon this morning. Now, listen very carefully. I'm really afraid that what you just heard me say is that I'm going to preach a short sermon. I did not say that I was going to preach a short sermon. I said that I was going to preach a one-point sermon and we'll see how far it goes. One point this morning, here it is, I'll give it to you right up front. Jesus has been given all authority in heaven and on earth. Jesus has been given all authority in heaven and on earth. Or to put it more succinctly, Jesus is Lord of all. That's what I want to preach this morning. That's the point of verse 18. That's what I want to share with you and show you from all the Bible this morning. Jesus is Lord of all. One-point sermon and here's what I'm going to give you. I'm going to give you the backstory to this verse, to this radical claim in verse 18. I'm going to give you the backstory. I'm going to give you the claim itself. We're going to look more carefully at this radical claim and then I'm going to give you some implications for you and for me. So backstory, claim, implications for you and me, one-point sermon, but I just said three points. Funny how it always seems to work out that way, doesn't it? The backstory, the claim, and then implications for you and me. Let me begin with, and by giving you one big blob of a backstory to these words which appear in Matthew 28 and verse 18. Again, this is a high point in the Bible in Matthew 28, but Jesus didn't just show up in a vacuum or like a shooting star in the night and say this before disappearing forever. If he did, then these words would have very little weight and we certainly wouldn't take him that seriously. But they don't come in a vacuum. These words don't appear out of nowhere. This claim on the mountain, number one, comes at the very end of his life. He's already lived a lot of life. We've already watched him live a lot of life. Number two, they come at the end of Matthew's gospel and actually, in a way, they tie together all kinds of themes and threads throughout the entire gospel of Matthew. But thirdly, and most importantly, what I want to show you, these words come towards the end of a really long story which has been told by God and been inspired by God, which is the story of the entire Bible, a story which began in Genesis. So I want to tell you a story. It's the Bible story. It's the backstory to these words, and it's a story of authority, and it's a story of sin, and it's a story of heaven and earth. I want to tell you that story because that's the backstory to these famous words. Are you ready for one big blob of a backstory? Ready? Let's go. In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. Genesis 1.1. At this point, you could be forgiven if you believed that I was going to read or recite. I couldn't. And we'd be here for hours and hours and days and days, and that would be glorious. In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. That's where the Bible begins with God creating, notice, the heavens and the earth. And the heavens and the earth, at the start of Genesis, are joined together. Now I know that's hard to imagine for us, all this time, all these worlds away from that world. But at the start of Genesis, heaven and earth are joined. So God creates a garden, and this garden is a paradise where, again, heaven and earth seem to be married together. So there are animals there, and the man and the woman are there. But then we read that God is there. In Genesis 3, he's there walking around, as it were. This is symbolic speech, but he's walking around in the garden as in the cool of the day. So God is there among them. So there's not this distance from the beginning between heaven and earth, and between God and man like we think of it, like we assume. There's not this division between the two. Eden, the Garden of Eden, is a temple, a sacred place where heaven and earth meet together and even overlap. And into this garden, God creates and puts the man and the woman. That's what Genesis 2 and 3 teaches us. Now I've preached through, even recently, the first 25 chapters of Genesis, and I've tried to show you during that time, especially at the beginning, just how special Adam was. He was, if you remember, if not, I'm going to catch you up to speed, but he was appointed by God to rule. So he names the animals. He's told in Genesis 1 to exercise dominion, authority, and protect the garden. So he's under God. Adam is under God as a servant, but he's the world's king and the earth's authority. That was God's intention from the beginning. But if you know anything about the Bible, you know how badly that went and how quickly that was lost. God gave to Adam one boundary, just one. Everything is yours except that one forbidden tree. And so enter into the scene, enter into the story. A serpent who is the devil, the Bible tells us, whispering lies, spreading rumors which aren't true about God and about God's intentions. And for a moment, as the serpent whispers, and as Adam and Eve hears, for a moment, all of creation hangs in the balance until Adam goes for it, crosses the boundary, eats from the tree. He sinned and everything in that moment changed. There's been nothing in the history of the world more deadly, no war, no genocide, no tsunami or earthquake or famine, there's been nothing in the history of the world more deadly and with more deadly consequences than what happened in that moment in the garden when everything changed. Sin entered into our world and so death entered into our world. We became, in that moment, Adam and everyone after him, we became a world of sinners and therefore a world of the dying. We all take death for granted because of this moment. Adam forfeited his crown to a serpent, to the satanic serpent, and heaven and earth in this moment, you have to see this, this is the back story, heaven and earth overlapping in this moment were ripped apart and the garden of Eden was gone and lost forever. Let me pause here, still in the middle of my back story, my big blob of a back story, let me pause here and offer a few reflections before I keep on making this blob even bigger. Three quick reflections, first a reflection on Satan and authority. I just want to briefly show you Satan's authority from the Bible and I want to, in a way, prove to you that yes, Adam gave up that crown when he sinned and yes, Satan picked that crown up in his stead. Let me just show you a few quick highlights from the Bible to make the point, beginning in the gospels and beginning with Satan's famous temptation of Jesus. Do you remember what Satan, the devil, offered to Jesus when he was tempting him? Matthew 4, you don't have to turn there, but just listen, Matthew 4, 8, and 9, again, the devil took Jesus up to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory and he said to him, all these I, this is Satan to Jesus, all these I will give to you if you will fall down and worship me. Do you see how Satan knows and assumes that he holds these kingdoms of the world and even in some sense has the authority to give them to Jesus if Jesus will succumb? Very similarly, over in Luke's gospel, Luke 4, 5, and 6, and the devil took Jesus up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time, amazing thought, and said to him, to you I will give all this authority and their glory for, watch this, for it has been delivered to me and I will give it to whom I will. Now listen, Jesus resisted him, but he did not correct him. As though Satan were claiming to have possession of some world, some kingdom, some authority that he didn't actually have. At least in that far, he was telling the truth. That's why Paul in Ephesians 2, 2 calls Satan the prince of the power of the air, air, the air, this world. That's why John in John, or Jesus rather, in John 14, 30 calls Satan the ruler of this world. That's why John in 1 John 5, 19 says, listen to this, we know that we, he's speaking to believers, to churches, we know that we are from God and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one. Are you hearing the same thing again and again and again? 1 Corinthians 4, 4, Paul, in their case, that is in the case of the unbeliever, in their case, the God of this world, again, speaking of Satan, the God of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. I know this is a big claim, but are you seeing it clearly in the Bible? The Bible paints a really clear picture. God gave to Adam and to mankind authority to rule the earth under his, God's dominion. But Adam betrayed God, gave up his crown and the devil picked it up. The world is now the devil's domain. He has real authority, the Bible testifies, and he uses that authority to blind the minds of unbelievers, to deceive the nations, to rule tyrannically, to keep them from seeing the light of the glory of Christ, which is the only way to be saved, which leads me to my next reflection on us and authority. Us and authority. We all have a complicated relationship with authority, to say the least. I want you to just for a moment, pause right where you are, don't get up. Think about all the different authorities in your life, from parents to bosses, to coaches, to governors, to presidents, all the authorities in your life. People coming to mind, names, pictures, voices. Now let me ask you a very simple question. Don't answer out loud, but don't lie to yourself. How many of you have warm, fuzzy feelings inside right now? Do any of us have universally warm, fuzzy feelings inside right now as we think about all the authorities in our life? Maybe our relationship with authority isn't that complicated after all. On the whole, we fight against it, we despise it, and us, our generation, our culture, may be as much or more than any before us. Our authority, our disdain for authority, rather, peaks at age two, as every parent can testify, but then it doesn't go away, we just get potty trained. We kick against it, and listen, I'm not picking at you or me, it's not good, to be clear, but I'm actually just trying to help you to see the bigger story and what's behind our disdain for authority. Adam failed and handed his crown to the devil, and the devil does have real authority in this world. He is the ruler of this age. Is it any surprise that authority is now misused and abused all the time? Kings and politicians all abuse authority, sometimes. Parents and pastors sometimes abuse authority, and so we hate it, we kick against it in large part, because we're scared to death of it. And one more reflection on heaven and earth, before I keep building the blob bigger. One more reflection on heaven and earth. In Eden, I'm repeating this on purpose, because I want you to get it. In Eden, heaven met with earth, together, overlapping, and so God walked with man. When Adam sinned, this is huge, he didn't just forfeit his crown, he lost access. He was banished from the presence of God, and so Genesis 3, 24 reads, and I've said many times, I think this is the saddest verse in the entire Bible, we read that God drove out the man, and at the east of the garden of Eden, he placed the chair of him, this great warrior angel, and a flaming sword that turned every way to guard the tree, to guard the way to the tree of life, and really to guard the way back to God. Heaven and earth, from Genesis 3 forward, heaven and earth have been divorced. They've been torn apart. God isn't just there, just right there anymore. You can't just hear his voice anymore, and you all know this, even if you didn't recognize it, or know why it's true. I talk to people struggling with doubt, somewhat regularly, even recently, one of the things they'll say is something like this, I don't understand, if God was real, why wouldn't he just make it clear? Hey, this is me, the God of the Bible, not Allah, or not whoever, other God, it's me. Why wouldn't he just do something, at least on occasion, that only he could do, to make the point, to prove the point, lift up a mountain into the sky, and put it back down, and sign it with his name in a rainbow? Have you ever wondered why wouldn't God just prove it, just show up, at least every once in a while? It's actually not a dumb thought. It makes so much sense that we would wonder that, but this is why, do you see? This is the Bible's answer to that question. Heaven and earth have been torn apart. Man has been banished from God. We have lost access. This is the price of our sin, estrangement, deafness to God's voice, blindness to his glory. Where is he? Where is Eden? All we have now are the rumors, and the stories, and the deep, deep longings inside of us, for that lost world, and for the sound of him walking through the leaves of the garden in the cool of the day. By the way, this is also why I believe the Bible, and I say something like this all the time. I believe the Bible as, I've empirically tested all 31,102 verses in the Bible in a lab, in a science lab, and I've proven each one to be true. I don't know of anything in the Bible or any verse that's not true, or has been proven untrue, and of course that matters, but more than that, I believe the Bible because I think the Bible, unlike anything else I've ever encountered, makes sense of the world, and makes sense of my own life, and my own heart, and my own problems. Everything I've ever known, or felt, or wanted, or lacked makes perfect sense if the Bible is true. Think about it. Why is the world so bad, and yet there's so much good? The Bible makes perfect sense of that. Why, if I'm honest, is there still so much dark stuff in my heart? The Bible makes sense of that, and explains that. Why is there death in the first place? Why must we all die? The Bible tells us that, and why does God sometimes, and maybe so often, feel so distant? Why can't you touch him? Why can't you see him, or hear him? The Bible tells us why. All right, now back to the backstory, because I want to give you more. I want to make the blob bigger, because there is so much more. You see, God, having judged Adam, who gave up, who forfeited his crown, and having allowed Satan to pick up that crown, God responded by making promises. Promises that he'd someday, in some way, do something to make this right. As soon as it happened, really, even as he was judging Adam and the satanic serpent, God made these promises. It all started in Genesis 3.15, where he promised, God promised, while judging Adam, mind you, he promised that a child would come. Someday, some son of Eve, some man, would come and crush the head of the serpent, and take authority back from him, take it away from the serpent. It all starts there. God's promises to do something, to make this right, and from there, it just keeps growing, like a snowball falling down a mountain, growing larger and larger, accumulating more and more snow, and then traveling faster and faster as it barrels down the mountain. It travels from Genesis 3.15, a son of Eve, to Genesis 49, he's going to be a lion from the tribe of Judah. It keeps going down, and we get to 2 Samuel 7, it's now a son of David, a king, who's going to rule in the line of David, and then we keep on reading, and it keeps growing bigger. We get to Isaiah 53, now it's moving really fast, really big, he's going to be a sufferer, a lame, who's going to suffer on behalf of his people, and it's barreling down, and faster and faster, until we arrive to Daniel 7. This big snowball of this big, ever-growing promise of God to do something, to make things right, to deal with this serpent, to deal with our sins, it grows larger and larger until we get to Daniel 7, which was already read for us in the beginning of the service. And I'm going to read for us again, because this is massive, if you want to understand Jesus' words in Matthew 28.18, listen to this vision from Daniel 7. I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven, there came one like a son of man, and he came to the ancient of days, and was presented before him. And to him, to this son of man, was given dominion and glory, and a kingdom that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed. Here it's like the snowball hits a little mound in the mountain, sending it soaring up into the air, and we get to all stare and behold its grandeur, its beauty, the bigness, its clarity, this promise. This is a vision of the future from God to the prophet Daniel. A vision is set in heaven, and before the throne of God Almighty, the ancient of days. One is presented before the ancient of days. Who is this one presented before the ancient of days? Who dares to enter his presence? He's named, he's called the son of man. So it's a man, it's a son of Eve. And to the son of man, the ancient of days, in this vision, grants power, and grants glory, and gives a kingdom, and gives a kingdom, not just any kingdom, but a kingdom containing all peoples of every nation and language. He's given, in other words, a crown to rule them all, and to rule them forever. He's given, it seems, that crown which Adam had lost. That crown which Satan had taken away. The king's crown to rule the earth as the king of kings is given to the son of man, and we're told that he'll reign forever. Now, with that gigantic, plenty big for now, blob of a backstory, I want you to hear afresh the audacious words and audacious claim of Jesus in Matthew 28, verse 18. Let me read it for you again. With all that behind it. And Jesus came and said to them, all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Do you hear it? Maybe you didn't hear it. Jesus came and said to them, all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Do you hear it? Standing on its own, in a vacuum, you hear the voice of one man making a ridiculous claim, which happens all the time. Just listen to the presidential debates later, or your crazy uncle. People claim wild things, not true things, audacious things all the time. But standing in the great hall of the Bible, with all that backstory behind it, you hear this one man's voice, and then you sit back and you listen to it echo off of every wall and chamber and room, and shake the entire house of the entire story of the Bible. Are you hearing what he's saying? All authority. What authority are we talking about here? What authority is he speaking of? He's speaking of all authority. All is actually a really important word in this Great Commission. I wonder if you notice this. Jesus repeats the word all four times in the Great Commission. All authority, in verse 18, he says, has been given to me. And so he sends them, in verse 19, to all nations, and they're to tell all the nations to obey all, same word that I have commanded you. And then he promises at the end, I am with you always. Fine translation, but unfortunate, because it's the exact same word as before. It is literally, I am with you all the time. Four times. All authority over all nations for all time. He's the Lord of all. Jesus displayed his all authority throughout the Gospels for all to see. He had authority over sickness and disease. He healed constantly, so he can heal you. He displayed his authority in the Gospels over nature. He spoke to wind and waves and trees, just like God did in Genesis 1. And creation obeyed him, and so he can restore the world. He demonstrated his authority over demons, over evil spirits. They recognized him throughout. They saw him. They knew who he was. They were terrified of him, and he cast them out, so he can set you free. And he showed his authority finally over death throughout the Gospels as he raised the dead. He raised Jairus' daughter. He raised Lazarus, his friend from the dead, and so he can raise you to new life. He has all authority. All authority. And he says specifically, he has all authority in heaven and on earth. Why does he say in heaven and on earth? Some people read this, gloss right over it, just take it as a statement of universality, like heaven and earth means everything, it covers everything, and so it just means everything and everywhere. That's what it means here. I think that's certainly true, but I think Jesus is saying more than that. If that's all he wanted to say, then his statement would be redundant. After all, he already started by saying all authority. What's the point in just repeating it again? No, heaven and earth is here actually expanding that and elaborating it. What is he saying that he has? Heaven and earth are different spheres. Different realms, if you will. A place where God dwells and a place where man dwells. Two worlds ripped apart by, once overlapping, but ripped apart by sin and now divorced. And they had to be ripped apart, for heaven is a world of love and holiness and could never be married to a world poisoned by sin like ours. And friends, here is Jesus Christ on the Mount of Galilee, a son of Eve, a son of Abraham, a son of Judah, a son of David, oh, and by the way, his favorite name to call himself throughout the gospels, a son of man. Here is Jesus, having died and been raised from the dead, claiming to have been given all authority in heaven and on earth. Given to him by who? The ancient of days, of course. Are you hearing what he's saying? Romans 14.9, for to this end, Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and the living. First Peter 3, 22, Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of the Father with angels, authorities, and powers, having been subjected to him. Jesus has the crown. Jesus has taken back the crown. He has the crown of heaven as the perfect son of God and he's taken back Adam's crown. The devil no longer has dominion over the nations because Jesus has been raised from the dead. All hail the power of Jesus' name. Let angels prostrate fall. Bring forth the royal diadem and crown him Lord of all. He has the crown. Do you hear what he's saying? Finally, to close, a few implications for you and for me. So why does this matter? I think it's amazing. I think it's cool, that big blob of a back story to see more clearly what Jesus is saying. But why does this matter for you? Why does this matter for me? I know some of you just want me to tell you what to do every week and I'm going to try a little. But more than that, I want you to see I'm trying to show you who you are and what the world is and what's really real in this life. Why does it matter? Of course, that's really what next week most directly is answering as we get to verse 19. And that is the disadvantage to preaching this in three sermons when it really is one passage. Jesus' radical claim, spoiler, is the basis for his radical call to mission. We'll get there next week. But until then, why does this matter for you? Four implications. Number one, we, and I mean me, of course, and you, we should preach this radical claim of Jesus. We should preach this radical claim of Jesus. Listen, there's one gospel, but this one gospel has many different angles to it. So think about it. Peace with God, forgiveness of sins, the love of God. But this one angle that we're looking at this morning that Jesus is claiming on the mountain is basic to the gospel, this angle. Jesus is Lord. We should preach that. Jesus is Lord. Preaching is, first of all, announcing. We should announce that regularly. Jesus is Lord. After all, that's what the apostles preached. That's exactly what they announced in the book of Acts. Listen to Peter's preaching in Acts, Acts 2.36, let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made Jesus both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucify. Acts 10.36, as for the word that he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ, parentheses, Peter, he is Lord of all. Sometimes people share the gospel and offer an invitation that goes something like this. Will you make Jesus the Lord of your life? Have you ever heard this? Have you ever said this? I've definitely said this. Now listen, hear me carefully. I want to be fair. I want to be kind. I'm not telling you that you're doing it wrong if you say that or ruining the gospel or harming people. Taking that question, will you make Jesus the Lord of your life, in the best sense, is a wonderfully searching question, but I just want you to see from Jesus on mouth how far that question actually misses the mark. There's no making Jesus Lord of my heart or my life or anybody else's heart. Jesus is Lord. He has claimed all authority in heaven and on earth, and listen, he's not negotiating it, his lordship with you or me or anybody. He is Lord. The question is, will you bow? The disciples, after hearing Jesus on this mountain, did not walk around apologizing and mumbling under their breath, excuse me, will you make Jesus king of your ... I'm sorry for even asking if you make Jesus Lord. No, they preached, they were beaten for it, and then they rejoiced that they were counted worthy of suffering for the Lord of all. We should preach this same radical claim of Jesus. By the way, if you're here this morning and you're not a follower of Jesus, what a privilege to have you, our honored guest, and you're welcome here every single week. We come to worship who we believe is the Lord of all, and we welcome all of whatever persuasion in whatever condition to come, to hear, to learn with us, to ask questions, to investigate, and honestly, I hope to be hugged by all of us, unless you're an introvert, and you're also certainly welcome too. We are so glad you're here. You are our privileged guest, but let me tell you clearly what Jesus is claiming in this passage this morning. He's claiming to be king of the world, and that means you too. He bases this claim on his resurrection from the dead. See, though he was a God, I'm sorry, though he was God, that was heretical what I just said, on accident, though he was God, he became a man, a human, just like you. But he, unlike you, unlike me, never played Satan's game. And unlike us, he never joined Satan in the rebellion. He never sinned. He was perfect for his entire life. He was perfect, and so when he died, it was not a normal death, even though it hurt like a normal death. Even worse, for it was death on a cross. When he died, he died on the behalf of others and in the place of others. He was dying their death. He was dying my death in order to take our judgment and to break our bondage to Satan and sin and set us free. Jesus is Lord. The question is, will you bow? Will you join us, many of us in this room, who are confessing and basing our life upon one confession, Jesus is Lord? Romans 10, 9 and 10, if you, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you, whoever you are, whatever you've done, you will be saved. This is not a 10-step process here. This is not a 10-year program here. This is a believe in the Lord Jesus, bow before him, confess him as Lord, and you're saved forever. Believe. Second, we should, and I'm speaking especially to the church, we should believe this radical claim and act like it's true. Hear me out on this. So often we act, Christians act like we're the ones outside of our jurisdiction in this world without any authority, and I understand there are Christians all over the world right now at this very moment under intense persecution who are in hiding, who are passing out Bibles secretly lest they be arrested or killed, and their behavior is not only justified but wise and holy. But if Jesus is telling the truth here, if he's actually right, who is actually in rule here and who is actually outside of their jurisdiction? The devil no longer has dominion. Christ has claimed all authority in heaven and on earth, and he's rescuing now people on the basis of that authority from every nation in all the world. The devil and his demons have resorted now, in other words, to guerrilla warfare. Theirs is an illegal operation taking place on the king's territory, and it's happening on a timer which will soon run out. So many of us are so ashamed and so scared to claim Jesus, to stand for Jesus, to share the gospel. Why is what I'm trying to ask. Do you see from this passage, why are we so afraid? We, when we're so afraid, are playing by the devil's terms, his rules, but we don't have to anymore. That's exactly what he wants you to believe. He wants to convince you that he, this, all this is still his domain, but it's not. He's been stripped of his power, exposed by Christ who has him on a leash. God is setting people free every day in every nation by the power of the gospel. Didn't he set you free? Why? Because the devil no longer has the authority to bind the nations, to blind the nations. Jesus has all authority. What the church needs today and until Jesus returns more than anything else is to believe that and act like it's true. And let's lock arms as a local church and act like it's true together. Third, we should worship Jesus, the son of God and king of kings. We should worship Jesus, the son of God and king of kings. I just want to make this point. Mission, sharing the gospel, going to the nations, going to your neighborhoods, whatever, mission begins with worship. Worship fuels our mission. Worship fuels our obedience. Before he tells them anything to do, he begins with this radical claim, I am Lord of heaven and earth. All authority has been given to me. I can probably guilt you into sharing the gospel maybe a little, to a degree, like if I'm angry enough or I don't know, manipulative enough or persuasive enough, I can move some of you for a day. But if God could catch your soul and entrance your heart with a vision in your soul of the risen glorious king of kings who has come and defeated the devil by his own death and resurrection, who did that all in love and set you free by that same love, who is our king, our captain, who is the commander of our army, who has already won and who will lead us to a sure victory, I don't think we'll be quiet. I don't think we'll be that afraid. If that's in our souls, our evangelism problem, our lack of care for the nations and for our neighbors is a worship problem. The bigger in our hearts Jesus is Lord, the surer, the more in awe, the more it overflows from our mouths. The more we can't help but to speak it, the more we can't help but to risk it, the more we'll suffer for it. So finally, concluding, fourth implication for you, for me, we should wait. I know that's anticlimactic, but hear me out on this. We should wait, but we should wait with urgency and in faith. We should wait. Urgency, friends, time is short. People are dying. We're all dying. There's only one remedy for sin in all the world. You want your life to most count. I want my life to most count. I don't want to live the rest of my life doing whatever it is that makes me the most comfortable, whatever is the easiest, or even whatever just makes me the most happy. I want to do whatever I can by the grace of God to be the most fruitful for His glory that I can possibly be, and I know you want the same. So urgency, but with urgency, wait. Why wait? Wait because right now you and I are living in between two worlds. We're waiting for the one, the one we've heard the rumors about, the one without pain or tears or sin or death. You can almost taste it, but it's just not here. And so we look as we're waiting to the one, and I want to invite you to look as we close to the one who stands between those two worlds, who has claimed the crown of both of those worlds, who is reigning as king over both of those worlds, and who someday and someday soon is going to bring those two worlds back together again for good. Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, John says, Revelation 21, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband, and heard a loud voice from the throne saying, Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be His people, and God Himself will be with them as their God. God, thank You for this amazing claim of Jesus. We would not believe it were true had we not seen so much more of Jesus, had we not encountered You ourselves through Your Word. God help us to believe it more. We are so much like these disciples, worshiping and yet doubting and yet fearing. God help us to believe, strengthen our faith by Your Holy Spirit, and God we pray for any among us who have not yet believed, we pray they would find refuge in Jesus. We pray that we would all bow, You would draw us to all bow before the King of Kings, the King of heaven and the King of earth, and it's in His name, it's in Jesus' name that we pray. Amen.
