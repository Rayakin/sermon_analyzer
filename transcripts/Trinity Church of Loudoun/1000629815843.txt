Genesis chapter 25 verses 19 to 34. These are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son. Abraham fathered Isaac, and Isaac was 40 years old when he took Rebecca, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddam Aram, and the sister of Laban the Aramean, to be his wife. And Isaac prayed to the Lord for his wife, because she was barren. And the Lord granted his prayer. And Rebecca, his wife, conceived. The children struggled together within her. And she said, if it is thus, why is this happening to me? So she went to inquire of the Lord. The Lord said to her, two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you shall be divided. The one shall be stronger than the other, and the older shall serve the younger. When her days to give birth were completed, behold, there were twins in her womb. The first came out red, all his body like a hairy cloak. So they called his name Esau. Afterward, his brother came out with his hand holding Esau's heel. So his name was called Jacob. Isaac was 60 years old when she bore them. When the boys grew up, Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was a quiet man dwelling in tents. Isaac loved Esau because he ate of his game, but Rebecca loved Jacob. Once Jacob, once when Jacob was cooking stew, Esau came in from the field and he was exhausted. And Esau said to Jacob, let me eat of some of that red stew, for I am exhausted. Therefore, his name was called Edom. Jacob said, sell me your birthright now. And Esau said, I'm about to die of what use is a birthright to me? Jacob said, swear to me now. So he swore to him and sold his birthright to Jacob. Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank and rose and went his way. Thus, Esau despised his birthright. This is the word of the Lord. One of my most shameful memories as a kid, I don't know exactly how old I was, I would guess nine or ten years old, but one of my most shameful memories as a kid, I went to the grocery store with my mom and I saw an orange soda on the aisle and I was thirsty. And when I saw the orange soda, I got thirstier. And so I showed my mom and she denied me. So I protested. I wasn't just thirsty, I was dehydrated to the point that it was becoming dangerous. And she denied me again. And so I got angry and I threw a tantrum and I hit the ground and I said I couldn't move anymore if I didn't get any drink here. I was fully committed at this point. And so my mom picked me up by the arm and my body had now gone fully catatonic and limp. And she dragged my butt out of the grocery store. Without any orange soda, my mom's awesome. And when we got home, she ratted me out to my dad. And I never tried that again. Turn to your Bibles with me to Genesis chapter 25. Genesis 25, back in Genesis. That's the Spirit. If you're new or visiting, I started preaching Genesis shortly after we moved into this building two years ago now. We preached, I preached Genesis 1 through 11, the first leg. Then we took a long break and did James and some other things. And then I preached Genesis 12 through 25, which is the story of Abraham, the journeys of Abraham. And then another break over the summer and beyond. And now, this morning, we begin the final leg of Genesis. So the story of Genesis so far, if you need a refresher or maybe you missed all that, the story of Genesis so far is the story of sin and the story of promise. Sin entered into the world almost as soon as the world was created. As Adam and Eve fell in the Garden of Eden to the lies of the serpent, God responded to sin in judgment. But also, even in judgment, He responded with promises. By making promises, most especially a promise that a seed would someday come from the human race, into the human race, through the pain of childbirth, which was part of the judgment. And the seed would come through the human race, into the human race, to defeat the devil and to undo the curse of our sins. And so in the book of Genesis, every time we meet a new character, we're watching and wondering if they might be that promised one, that promised seed. And so here comes Cain and then Abel and Seth and Noah and Shem. And the author eventually lands and sticks and stays for a long while on Abraham. But one by one, they rise, they fall, they die, even Abraham. Abraham is another seed in the book of Genesis and another son who became the friend of God. Abraham spoke to God face to face as to a friend. And for 100 years, Abraham believed God and so he followed God and so he was Genesis 15 says, counted as righteous. God struck promises with Abraham, specifically three headliner promises. Can you remember from so long ago the three big promises that God struck with Abraham? Look at that. People, place, and blessing. People. God promised to make Abraham into a nation. One man who had no children, he was infertile. God promised to make him into a nation, people, place. God promised to give Abraham, who was basically a homeless wanderer, God promised to give him a land, a home, a place to call home. And finally, blessing. God promised to restore his blessing to Abraham and through Abraham to bless all the nations, to restore his blessing to the world. Abraham died in Genesis 25. That's where we last left off in the book of Genesis. Abraham died but the promises did not die, including that blessing. That blessing went to Isaac, the long-awaited and finally arrived son of Abraham's old age. See Genesis 25 verse 11. So Isaac now has the blessing. Isaac now has really the hope of the world, the hope of all the nations in him. And that pretty much brings us up to speed and brings us to verse 19 where we read, look at chapter 25 verse 19. Moses, the author, says these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son. You might recall Genesis is broken up into chapters by Moses. I'm not talking about our chapters in our translations. Those are useful but those are just editors, scribes who have made up blocks to help us to read this in a better way. Moses has his own way of doing chapters and of breaking up his books but it's not with numbers. It's with this little catchphrase, these are the generations of. And so when we read chapter 25 verse 19, these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son. This is Moses marking off a new chapter, a new beginning in the book and the story of Genesis. It is now Isaac's turn. In verse 20, Isaac takes Rebekah to be his wife. You remember that whole story from months ago and just chapters before. In verse 21, Isaac and Rebekah are praying because, why? Because she's barren. Oh my goodness, it's all happening over again. History is repeating itself. Another promised one coming together to continue the line of promise, the line of the promises of God, and they're barren again. Verse 21, God grants Isaac's prayer. And I want you to see, Moses just says it like it's a checkmark in Isaac's prayer journal. It was a yes but you can see if you look down in verse 26, Isaac is 40 when the babies are born, or sorry, he was 60 when the babies were born. He was 40 when they married, meaning there were 20 years of barrenness, 20 years of praying, 20 years of waiting. It's all happening over again, you see? If you learn nothing else from Genesis, learn to pray and wait and keep on praying. Five years might not be a no. 20 years might not be a no. Moses nonchalantly calls this 20 years. Yeah, so the Lord granted it. He answered his prayer 20 years later. Delayed mercies are often the sweetest mercies, so keep on praying, keep on waiting. A two-part episode this morning, are you ready? Let us observe together Genesis 25. First, a strange birth, and second, a scorned birthright. A strange birth and a scorned birthright. Scene one, a strange birth. 20 years later, 20,000 prayers later, Rebecca was finally pregnant, and it hurt. It hurt like it hurts every expectant mother, so it hurt Rebecca. The pain would have reminded Rebecca of the curse of Genesis 3, which she would have known all too well, and it would have reminded her too of the hope of Genesis 3, which she also would have known all too well, given the family and the family story that she now belongs to by her marriage to Isaac, that through this pain, even her pain someday, maybe her pain, someday is going to come a child who's gonna make everything right again, and who's gonna take away every pain and every tear as well. But this pain that Rebecca feels was something more than the usual labor pains, which she eventually realized. I imagine she spoke with other mothers who had already had children, like this hurts a lot. Is it supposed to hurt like this? And eventually she got to them, like no, it's not supposed to hurt like that. It was agonizing. It was more than it should hurt. Something was wrong. Was she dying, she wonders. Verse 22 says, the children struggled together within her. The Hebrew there literally reads, the children smashed themselves together inside of her. Imagine two rams charging each other headfirst with their ram horns and just smashing their heads into each other. So the children in Rebecca's womb were smashing together. Rebecca knows something is off, and so she says, verse 22, why is this happening to me? And so we read, she went to inquire of the Lord. Now where did she go to inquire of the Lord? I don't know. The Bible doesn't say. It's possible she went out to the same fields of the Negev where Isaac used to go and meditate beneath the stars. I read of one old theory from a 500 year old commentator who was reciting an even older theory that Rebecca went and consulted with Melchizedek. I don't know where she went or who she went to, but I know she ultimately went to the Lord and that the Lord speaks to her, just like the Lord spoke to Abraham, because she, Rebecca, is now in the line of promise. By the way, don't miss this. In this great story of redemption in the Bible, God repeatedly speaks to women as well as to men. In fact, a really fun study, if you'd like to take the time and maybe use a little help from Google, just look up all the times that God speaks specifically to pregnant women who are becoming involved through their barrenness, now through their labor, in the grand story that God is writing. Verse 23 says, and the Lord said to her, He speaks to her and He says, here's an oracle from God, two nations are in your womb and two peoples from within you shall be divided. The one shall be stronger than the other and the older shall serve the younger. Just imagine your mothers or hopeful mothers or expectant mothers or already have children and have gone through all this. Just imagine hearing this oracle from God. The pain, this great and unbearable pain, is indeed from the children in her womb, plural, not one child but two. So there are twins in her womb and this unbearable pain God reveals to her is unbearable because the children in her womb are already at war. They are smashing and wrestling with each other already in her womb, which is all by God's providential design because He tells her these two sons represent two forthcoming nations who are going to come forth from your, Rebecca's, one womb. Two nations who will also be at war in perpetuity, just like the babies in your womb are already at war. What in the world? Haven't you missed Genesis? Again, I mean, just imagine. What a confusing word to a mother. What a sobering word for a mother to hear. My mom begged and basically prayed and shamed. I have three brothers and my mom forced us to love each other and be friends. And eventually, after we all graduated from high school, eventually it worked. We all grew up and the four of us are now the best of friends. Rebecca heard a word no mother wants to hear. Your sons are at war and shall always be at war. Of course, coming in Genesis, you can't help but to read here and hear notes of an even greater war which this represents. The war of all wars between the line of the seed of the woman and the line of the seed of the serpent. That's the story that Genesis is telling and the stage for that war is now set in Rebecca's womb. Rebecca receives a further word from the Lord when she hears that contrary to every cultural, every biological, every family expectation, she is told by God that the older son shall serve the younger son. So there's this reversal. Look at verse 24. When her days to give birth were completed, behold, there were twins in her womb. The first one came out all red, all his body like a like a hairy cloak. So they called his name Esau. Esau means hairy. Afterward, his brother came out with his hand holding Esau's heel. So his name was called Jacob. Jacob means heel. Isaac, we read, was 60 years old when she bore them. So the due date arrives and it could not arrive soon enough with all the awful pain and war happening inside of Rebecca's womb. And sure enough, twins are born. Twin boys come out. Now I should say just very briefly, I took a preaching class at the end of seminary and one of the things that the preacher, the teacher, the homiletics professor taught to us, he told us to always avoid the three B's when preaching. Bedroom, bathroom, and birthroom. And I have always avoided, you've never heard me make any innuendos or any allusions to bedroom, birth, I don't make any jokes about bedroom, bathroom, or birthroom. I abide by this rule. I'm afraid this morning I must break this rule as Moses invites us all into Rebecca's birthroom right alongside the midwives. The first baby comes out red and hairy. Now that could just be he's covered all over with thick reddish hair or maybe the baby has a darker reddish complexion. Either way, they chose as the name for the child Esau, which means hairy. But that wasn't the strangest feature of this unusual birthing. When Harry came out, he had a hand attached to his heel, which turned out to be the hand of his little brother. And Rebecca and the midwives were all so astounded by this that they named their second son Jacob, which means heel. And so two sons wrapped up in the story of God before they're ever even born, and they're named Harry and Heel. What a strange birth, and what does it all mean? The oracle is from God, and the oracle given to Rebecca from God gives us the meaning of this birth. Jacob and Esau, Harry and Heel, are each eventually given other names, other nicknames, which they go down in history and really in infamy. Jacob eventually becomes known, of course, as Israel. We'll come to that in Genesis 32. And Esau, we'll see in just a moment, becomes known also not just as Esau, not just as Harry, but as Edom, which means red and which carries further connotations than redness. So Jacob and Esau, Harry and Heel, are also Israel and Edom. Because, God makes clear in this oracle, each, Jacob and Esau, are the fathers of two respective nations. Jacob, Israel, is the father of Israel, the people of God with all the promises of God. Esau, Edom, is the father of Edom, who are, if you know your Bible history, Israel's brothers turned enemies. When Israel later escaped Egypt, so the the Exodus, they requested safe passage through Edom's lands. Edom refused. When Israel fell to Babylon, still later in their history, Edom rejoiced at Israel's fall. Edom, at one point, raided Judah and the people of God. Your Bible has several oracles of judgment written specifically against Edom, the people, the nation of Edom. Your Bible, did you know, has an entire book which is written and recorded. The entire book is an oracle against Edom. Does anybody know what book that is? Obadiah. It's an oracle. The entire book is an oracle, a prophetic judgment against Edom. Two nations at war and the war began in Rebekah's womb. What a strange birth and what should you care about it? Why should you care about it? Well, when Paul wanted to preach a sermon, millennia later, and when he wanted to preach a sermon on the electing grace of God, he turned here and to Genesis 25 and to Rebekah's womb and he said this in Romans chapter 9. And not only so, but also when Rebekah had conceived children by one man, our forefather Isaac, though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad, but in order that, here's Paul's sermon, in order that God's purpose of election might continue, not because of works but because of him who calls, so Rebekah was told, the older shall serve the younger. Do you see what Paul's saying there? Everybody in all the world always has assumed that if there was a God and if there is such a place called heaven or a paradise or whatever, then the way to get there is by being good girls and good boys, by doing your best, by not being a bad girl, not being a bad boy. Well, in the story that God was writing, heaven will not be attained by works for no one is righteous. Jacob, spoiler, is a dirty rotten scoundrel. You're gonna be really tempted in coming weeks because of God choosing Jacob and elevating him over Esau as the younger who the older is gonna serve. You're gonna be really tempted reading this story to look for and to find redemptive qualities in Jacob. Some reason why God must have chosen him and not Esau. You're not gonna find him. This guy's awful. He's a scoundrel. In the story God was writing, it will not be by money, by status, by power, or by lineage. It will not matter who your parents are in the kingdom of God. It will not matter how smart or how rich you are, how many people know your name, what other people think of you. None of that matters in the kingdom of God. What matters in the kingdom of God? 1st Corinthians 1, for it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart, God says. Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For since in the wisdom of God the world did not know God through its own wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe. That's how the grace of God runs. That's how the grace of God works. Wild and free and with constant surprises and reversals. It moves past kings preferring the company of children. It cares not for the rich or for the powerful or for the most educated or intelligent. It works its plans, the grace of God does, through poor little virgin girls. It creates as it works a new world order, the grace of God, where the last become first, where the hungry are filled and where the rich are sent away empty as Mary sings in her Magnificat. Where slaves become brothers and where only, only the broken and humbled are ever exalted. Where the most despised and abased man in the history of the world is exalted as King of Kings and Lord of Lords and receives the name above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow and every tongue confess together Jesus Christ is Lord. The older shall serve the younger. Surprise. This is the way of God. Have you seen and embraced the wonderful works and ways of God? End scene. The second scene in our passage this morning moves us forward in the story and moves us forward in time as Harry and Heel are all grown up now. And so look with me second as we transport forward in time at a scorned birthright. Verse 27, when the boys grew up Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was a quiet man dwelling in tents. Isaac loved Esau because he ate of his game, but Rebecca loved Jacob. So Esau and Jacob, Harry and Heel are all grown up and as you can see they could not be any different. Esau is a man's man. He loves to hunt. He loves to eat red meat which he killed with his own hands. You can hear Esau coming from a mile away. He's a loud alpha male. Esau is the big loud brute who peaked in high school only to find out later that size and volume can only take you so far in life after that. Jacob is more quiet and reserved, probably indoorsy, perhaps a bit reclusive. Jacob is the kid nobody noticed or cared about in high school. He was more reserved. He was a little nerd he was he was easy to miss and overlook, but Jacob was the kid who turns out was scheming in the shadows, who turned out to be really ambitious and really cunning. Jacob is the is the one whose surprise goes really far in life, the late bloomer who ends up being the boss of us all, much to the chagrin especially of all the Esau's of this world, who didn't care about and who dominated that guy in high school. Esau and Jacob are both very familiar characters. Most all of us are probably in some ways more like the one or the other. Who do you most identify with? Are you more emotional and impulsive like Esau? Are you more quiet, calculating like Jacob? Are you more prone to erupt in anger or quietly manipulate those around you? Esau is the pride of his father, Jacob is a mama's boy. Isaac and Rebecca make the awful mistake of preferring children, of choosing favorites, no doubt only furthering the rift between the two sons. By the way, we should, if I could just say the obvious, we should never do that as parents. We should work as parents twice as hard with those of our children who we less naturally identify with. Verse 29, once when Jacob was cooking stew, Esau came in from the field and he was exhausted. And Esau said to Jacob, let me eat some of that red stew for I'm exhausted. Therefore his name was called Edom, red. Jacob said, sell me your birthright now. Esau said, I'm about to die of what use is a birthright to me? Jacob said, swear to me now. And so he swore to him and he sold his birthright to Jacob. Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew and he ate and drank and rose and went his way. Thus Esau, Moses concludes, despised his birthright. If you want to understand this story, this, if you grew up in Sunday school like I did, this very familiar and yet so often like so many of the most familiar stories, it's so easy to miss the point, miss what all is going on. If you want to understand this story, you have to understand something so far and so strange to us in the birthright. Esau was born first. He was three minutes or three seconds ahead of little brother, baby brother Jacob. Either way still makes him the firstborn. It's an accident, maybe just seconds as far as we can tell, but everything in this family, everything in this culture, everything in this story which God is writing, everything matters by who comes out first. You see, the firstborn was given the birthright, a special status for the oldest son. It meant a doubled inheritance in comparison to the rest of the brothers. See 21, chapter 21, verse 17 of Deuteronomy where this is enshrined into law. And even more than that, in this situation, in this book, in this story, the Father's blessing, people place blessing, the Father's blessing is wrapped up in this birthright and that blessing goes therefore to the firstborn. In fact, in the book of Genesis, in your Bible, in your Old Testament, the words blessing, firstborn, and birthright are all built off of the same word. They're like mirror images, really anagrams of each other in a beautiful way if we could read Hebrew. They are Barakah and Bekorah. They're all intimately related to each other because, again, the birthright, this birthright contains God's blessing and Genesis, in Genesis, that blessing is everything. That blessing, this blessing is God's favor. This blessing in Genesis is God's friendship. The one with this blessing speaks to God face-to-face like Abraham did as God's friend. This blessing in Genesis marks and continues the line of promise. This blessing in Genesis is related to the seed of the woman who will someday crush the head of the serpent. This blessing in Genesis is God's plan of salvation, working its way through seeds and barrenness and pregnancies and families and twin brothers and human history all the way down. This blessing in Genesis is the hope for all the nations. From this blessing comes Christmas and Easter. From this blessing comes the Savior and salvation. This blessing is everything, you see? And so Esau's out for a hunt one day. He hunted wild game with a bow. What an awesome guy. We would all be impressed. And he's on the move all day and he comes home famished. He stumbled home. He smelled the aroma from Jacob's tent. And so he burst into Jacob's tent where Jacob was cooking, where Esau had smelled it, his cooking, from a mile away. And Esau, bursting in, saw with his eyes what he smelled with his nose. He saw a steaming red stew. By the way, if you're a cook or a chef and you want to have a little fun with the Bible, Google when you get home, Jacob's red lentil stew. You can find a recipe. I don't know if it's authentic, but. Verse 30, Esau is carefully painted by Moses for the brute that he is. Let me eat, we read. That's not the usual phrase for eating. It's literally, let me cram down my throat, a word for shepherds used to force feed sheep who will not eat. Cramming it down their gullet. Let me eat. Give me red, he says. You can see he's just driven by his eyes, his impulses, his senses. Red, red, Esau walks around like an animal. Hence Esau's other name, as I mentioned earlier, Edom. He's not just hairy now, he's red, showing, memorializing this moment, but also hinting at his hot-tempered, impulsive personality. And so the nation which shall arise from Esau will ever be known from this point forward as the Edomites, the red people, the reddish people. Named forever for their father's wild, unruled flesh and desire. Jacob, on the other hand, is calm and calculated as ever. He speaks in a quiet, paced voice. Sell me your birthright, Jacob suggests. No hesitation whatsoever. He's been planning all along, quiet, calculated. Jacob, planning in the shadows, waiting patiently for the right moment, and here it is. Esau's out hunting all day. Now Jacob hunts his prey like a spider, quietly, slowly, methodically, one threat at a time. Esau, no time for thought, no category for self-denial, immediately strikes the deal with his brother. He says, I'm about to die. What use is a birthright when I'm dead? He spews out in verse 32. This is not reality, I should say. There's no reason to believe that he's actually on the brink of death. This was pure emotional theater. This is an impulsive brute. This is a spoiled child screaming on the grocery store floor for an orange Fanta. Jacob cuts the deal. Swear to me now, he says in verse 32. Look how calculated this guy is. He wants it in writing. He wants an oath for when Esau's not hungry any longer and not throwing a temper tantrum any longer, for when he wakes up from his nap later in the day and returns to his senses and realizes what he's done, he wants it in writing. Esau takes the deal, swears the oath, lays down before the spider, devours the meal while Jacob watches, and then off he goes, having no idea that he just altered the course of human history for a bowl of stew. Moses, the narrator, concludes the story with an interpretive comment. You'll notice in verse 34, this is what you're supposed to take away from this scene. Moses often doesn't do this. It's clear if you read the story carefully, but he usually doesn't just tell us what it means and what we're supposed to take away. Here he just tells us what it means. Verse 34, thus Esau despised his birthright. Now what are you supposed to take from that? A little parable about the dangers of hunger, being hangry. I've got a near two-year-old right now. Every morning she wakes up mad, mad as fire. She's hungry, angry, so sinful. Turn with me to Hebrews 12, actually. If you have your Bible, go ahead and turn towards the end of your Bible. Hebrews chapter 12. Once again, the New Testament helps us so much here to know exactly what we're to take from these stories in our own lives and as followers of Jesus Christ, as the people that the Bible calls the church. Hebrews chapter 12, and look down at verse 15. See to it that no one fails to obtain the grace of God, that no root of bitterness springs up and causes trouble, and by it many become defiled. See to it that no one is sexually immoral or unholy like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal. Now let me just pause and make comment. That comes, these verses come right on the heels of Hebrews 11, and you may be familiar with, very familiar with Hebrews 11, of course, is the so-called hall of faith, where we meet all these characters, Enoch and Abel and Abraham and Isaac, and somehow, if you can believe it, even Jacob. Moses and Rahab, all these characters who made it to glory with God by faith, by waiting, by believing, by trusting. And then right after that hall of faith, all of chapter 11, chapter 12 comes, and Esau, this is amazing, Esau is listed by the author of Hebrews as the one foil to all those pilgrims from chapter 11 who made it safely home to God by faith. You see, he's the one antithesis to all those who live by faith and so were saved by faith. Esau is given here as a picture of one who was ruled, not by faith, but by flesh, by sight, by smell, by desire, by lust, by passion. It's so interesting here that Hebrews, you saw there, refers to Esau's sexual immorality. Where'd that come from? That's not in the story. We don't, we don't read that, but if you think about it, he's ruled by his flesh. He acts on impulse. He acts without any reservation based on what he smells, what he sees. Actually, it makes perfect sense, doesn't he? Don't you see who he is? And don't you see a little Esau in yourself, in myself, in your flesh, in my flesh? Esau will throw away God's blessing. Esau will throw away heaven, his inheritance, to avoid just a little bit of suffering, just a little bit of hunger pains. Esau would never live for anything beyond the moment. He would never make his life about anything that he must wait for. Does that sound familiar? Billions of people today live their entire lives running around and around, chasing money and chasing popularity and chasing comfort and chasing love and chasing pleasure and chasing everything, everything, anything for here and for now and never, ever, ever once looking up and considering, why am I here in the first place? And who put me here? And what is he like? And what does he want for me? And how do I make it to him? Don't you see who Esau is? Esau may be some of you this very moment. Esau is all of you without the Spirit of God. Esau is you and me if we just give up and give in to the flesh, to all of our desires, to the devil. And listen to this harrowing warning that Hebrews finishes this. Look back at Hebrews 12 verse 17. This is an unbelievably sobering note. For you know that afterward, when Esau desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected. For he found no chance to repent, though he sought it with tears. Oh my friends, do not wait until it's too late. Esau so fed his flesh, so seared his conscience, so refused the Holy Spirit that he found himself in a day, in a time, in a position where he no longer could repent of Satan's greatest lies. Offers to all of us at one point, many points or another. Yeah, I'll fix this later. I know. I'm living, I'm living wrong. I'm living for myself. I'll get right with God later. That's a lie. You feel conviction. Your conscience alarm bell rings when you sin. You hear the Word of God and something in you jumps, whether it's conviction of your sin or hope in God or both. Do not refuse the Holy Spirit. Repent of your sins and trust in Christ before it's too late. Why would you put that off? Friends, that's where Moses concludes Genesis 25. I'm not gonna leave you there. Tempted to. I'm not gonna leave you there. There's another story in the Bible of two brothers, of two sons. Not Harry and Heel. We don't know these two sons' names, these two brothers, but one of these brothers, as you read the story in the Bible, is a whole lot like Esau. He also despised his father's birthright, demanded his inheritance early, forsook his father, blew everything, all the inheritance of his father, which he demanded prematurely, blew it all on pleasure. He lived by appetite. Whatever his heart, whatever his stomach, whatever his eyes desired, he had it and he had it in that moment. He lived for today and he cared not for tomorrow and then one day he woke up and he woke up. What am I doing? My father had everything for me. My father's servants, he said, are far more blessed, far more cared for, far more wealthy, far more joyful than I am here slopping around with pigs. And so this son, a lot like Esau, traveled back home to beg his father for mercy, hoping that his father would at least, based upon his status as a son, let him have a place with the servants in the back of the line. He walked home and upon walking home he found his father waiting for him. Every day he'd been waiting for him, watching for him, looking for him, waiting for the chance that his son, who might be dead but he might return home, and this day his father found him and his father ran and embraced him. And his father didn't chide him at all or put him in timeout or give him any kind of secondary status. His father threw a party for him. Jesus told that story to tell you the heart of his father and to tell you his heart for all his sons and all his daughters, for any who would just turn around and come back home. Come home before it's too late and there's eternal joy. That's the gospel. God, what a kindness to hear your word. All of us in our sins, if not interrupted by you, by your word, by your spirit, all of us, with Esau we go to hell forever. God, thank you for interrupting mercy, for saving grace, not potential grace, saving grace, holding grace, keeping grace. God, help us to live by faith and not by sight and not by flesh and not by appetite and not by inordinate hungers and cravings. God, call more sons and daughters home. And we pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
