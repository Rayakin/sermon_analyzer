I want to share a quote to start us off from C.S. Lewis, from The Weight of Glory. He says, It would seem that our Lord finds our desires not too strong but too weak. We are half-hearted creatures fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered to us. Like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea, we are far too easily pleased. If you have your Bibles, you can turn with me to Hebrews chapter three. And this will be now the fourth sermon I've given here in the book of Hebrews. And up to this point, the author has been focusing on one primary theme in Hebrews chapters one through two, three, and that is the supremacy of Christ over all things. He's writing to an audience of new Jewish believers, and up to this point, the author of Hebrews has spent most of his time unpacking why Christ is greater than and even the fulfillment of everything that their religious lives have revolved around up to this point, before they became Christians. So we looked at how Jesus is greater than the angels, right, God's messengers. How Jesus is greater than Moses, the great patriarch of the faith, the lawgiver. And eventually further down the road, we'll continue this theme and we'll look at how Christ is greater than the priesthood and the sacrificial system. But for today, here in chapters three and four, we're going to take a quick break from that particular theme of Christ's supremacy because the author is going to take a quick break to briefly introduce us to another extremely important biblical concept. This is a concept that we see all throughout the Bible, from the very first pages of Genesis in the creation account, all the way through to the very end of the story in the book of Revelation, and that is the biblical idea of rest, rest. You might hear rest and think, okay, this could be a sermon about the importance of taking some good time off and enjoying ourselves or pausing, taking a break, or even more seriously than that, the rest that Jesus provides for his followers. Those are all true. But far beyond that, rest is so important of a concept for the Christian life that the author places it right in the middle of this great sermon in Hebrews on the supremacy of Christ, smack dab in the middle. The idea of rest is a reoccurring biblical theme and a crucial theological foundation to understanding salvation and even the nature of saving faith. In fact, listen to this, the biblical idea of rest is the linchpin that holds together salvation purchased by Christ and persevering in faith. Again, the biblical idea of rest is the linchpin that holds together salvation purchased by Christ and persevering in faith. Furthermore, the author of Hebrews introduces the idea of rest to us in the form of a warning here in chapters three and four. One of the famous of five warning passages that we see all throughout the book of Hebrews, this is number two, and so the passage here is warning us against becoming hardened by sin and instead calling us to enter into the joy of God's rest. So we see these two competing ideas all throughout these next couple of verses. Don't be hardened by sin, instead enter into God's rest. Hardening rest. Rest. It goes back and forth as we'll see. So with that, we're going to jump into our text as Christina already read. Let me read for us again verses seven to 11, Hebrews chapter three. It says, therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion on the day of testing in the wilderness where your father has put me to the test and saw my works for 40 years, therefore, I was provoked with that generation and said, they always go astray in their heart. They have not known my ways. As I swore in my wrath, they shall not enter my rest. So the author of Hebrews here is quoting from Psalm 95 as we read, a Psalm of David. And so what we see in these verses is the introduction of our two competing concepts. We see hardening, right, verse eight, and we see rest, verse 11. Hardening and rest. And I want to start off first by asking, what is this hardening? What is the nature of this hardening that the Israelites tragically fell into? That we ourselves as the church now are being warned against? How are we to think about this hardening? So first, let's examine Israel for a moment. They're in Egypt as slaves. Moses comes along and they witness this incredible, amazing deliverance by the hand of God. Plagues, deliverance from Egypt, giant whirlwind of fire protecting them from the soldiers, and then of course, the parting of and the passing through the Red Sea. Amazing moment. And yet despite having an actual front row seat to all of this, their hearts were in such a place that they still turned to idolatry. Right? Remember the golden calf right there at the foot of the mountain, the grumbling, the complaining? How quickly they forgot the mighty works of God. And so it says actually in verse 12, as we'll look in a second, that they had evil, unbelieving hearts. Evil, unbelieving hearts. So this hardening, right? It takes on such a form that despite seeing the incredible works of God, there's still blindness that prevents them from entering into God's good rest, a.k.a. for them, the promised land. Which is a warning for us now, so that we would not miss entering into God's eternal promises. This is so relevant for us even today in our lives. Where do we see the goodness of God in our lives and yet we are cold to it, numb to it? How do we fail to remember and to cultivate hearts of gratitude within ourselves? Failing to do this then leads to apathy, to sin, to greater idolatry as we see with Israel. Romans chapter 1 and Ephesians chapter 4 both actually speak in the New Testament to this descent into sin, into deeper and deeper sin, this hardening that can occur. And yet God in his love, man, he warns us against this. And so we see also introduced here in verse 11 is now the counterpart to hardening we see rest. And so having now put before us the example of the Israelites in verses 7 to 11, who were hardened and who failed to enter that rest, the author of Hebrews actually throughout the remainder of our passage, and this is where we're going to be primarily today, gives us what I'm going to call four life-giving commands. Four life-giving commands to these new Jewish believers. What do I mean by life-giving commands? We tend not to like commands and we don't like being told what to do. But imagine with me a scenario, okay? Imagine with me that you are in a desert. You're dying of thirst, starving, all alone. The sun is beating down, the heat is draining every ounce of your energy. You collapse on the sand, you're laying there. You know that the end is near. When all of a sudden a caravan arrives and a man gets off of this caravan, perhaps of camels, and this man brings to you fresh food, fresh water, and he commands you to do what? To eat and to drink so that you may live. He commands saying, do this, eat and drink, take of this nourishment. Well, nobody in their right mind in that moment is going to say, well, don't tell me what to do. How dare you? Don't boss me around. It's silly. Every one of us, if we're in that situation, would joyfully obey this life-giving command to eat, to partake, to save, and to sustain ourselves. What we see in Hebrews is similar. These are warnings. These are commands that are given that are intended to keep us away from sin, away from hardening, and also to keep us from missing out on the joy, the salvation, and the eternal rest that is found in Christ. So for today, what we'll do, our roadmap, is we'll move through our text. We'll see these two competing concepts again, hardening and rest, hardening and rest, back and forth. And then we'll also look at four life-giving commands that enable us to, by faith, move away from hardening and into God's rest. Let's keep going, verse 12. He says, take care, brothers and sisters, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart leading you to fall away from the living God. So therefore, church, in light of what we just saw with Israel, their hearts being hardened and failing to enter into rest, we see our first life-giving command of our passage today. And that is this, life-giving command number one, take care. Take care. Nick, is that really a command? Seems like a brief filler statement. So the Greek word here is the Greek word blepo. Here's what it means. It means to see, to discern, to weigh carefully, to examine, to examine with the mind's eye. Take care, brothers and sisters. Wake up. Take special care to discern and to give focused attention to examining yourself, why? Lest there be inside of you an evil, unbelieving heart. You need to examine yourself and see, to look, because if you don't, then it could do what? Keep going. Leads you to fall away from the living God, the God who gives life and who leads us into his rest. Don't want to miss that. This is exactly what Yahweh, what the Lord was doing for his people, leading them out of Egypt, out of slavery, out of the desert to the land of promise, into his blessing, and yet they failed to examine themselves. Blepo. They failed to see in themselves their unbelieving hearts. Gosh, they missed it. So that first generation failed to enter into the life that God had for them through belief, through faith. They did not heed the life-giving command to take care and to examine themselves. So now the warning is obvious for us, right? How might you need to take care and examine yourself? What subtle sins, accommodations, idols, addictions, or maybe just comforts might be feeding an unbelieving heart in yourself? Take care. Consider this warning and obey this life-giving command to examine yourself. And oh, by the way, as we're going to see with all these four commands, don't just do it in isolation. Brothers and sisters, brethren, the author says take care, brothers and sisters, in Christ, church, take care together. And on the heels of this warning against an evil, unbelieving heart, we right away actually come to our second life-giving command that we see in the text. Verse 13 says this. But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called today, that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. There it is, number two. Life-giving command number two, exhort one another every day. So to exhort, right, means to encourage strongly, to urge, to warn, to admonish. Again, similar to our first command, notice the corporate component to this. We are unable to avoid the deceitful effects of sin, verse 12, unless we as a church, verse 13, are exhorting and speaking truth to one another, speaking the gospel into one another's lives. And unless we do this, what will happen? What's the fruit of not doing this? Hardening. Think of Israel. Think of Romans 1 and Ephesians 4. The flesh, the enemy, the world, all working in tandem to pull us away from the living God and away from his rest. This really ups the ante in a good way of the church body needing one another. Christian, here's another question for you to consider. To what extent do you allow the church body to speak into your life with truth and with exhortation? Do you let this happen? Do you let others in? Do we want to see the deceitful effects of sin destroyed in us? Then we have to let the church into our lives. Right on a super practical level for us at Trinity Church of Loudon as a church, this life-giving command is one of the reasons that we do community groups and Bible studies and men's and women's retreats and breakfasts and accountability groups. We must allow for truth and for exhortations to be lovingly proclaimed, there's the word there, key word, in and over us if we are to enter into God's rest and if we are to see the deceitfulness of sin destroyed in our hearts. That's hard work because relationships can be hard, can be messy. Some of us might have felt and experienced hard and hurtful things at the hands of church folk who've all been there in some way or another. Opening up yourself to relationships and exhortation can be hard, but here's the hopeful piece actually when it is hard, especially with that relational dynamic. Here's the good news in the midst of this life-giving command of exhorting one another. Verse 14, we have come to share in Christ if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end. So what we share as believers as a church is not just cold moralism, it's not just a competitive do-gooderness, no, it's Christ who is in our midst if we hold fast together in faith in the gospel. And so therefore because that's true, Christ is in our midst and we share in him, we can be confident as we let others speak into our lives knowing that God's spirit and his power amongst us as we are united by faith will bear fruit for his glory, knowing that he will keep us, protect us, bring unity, joy, and mutual love for one another and for the sake of his name. We can give and we can receive exhortation with one another in love because our hope and confidence are in the fact that we share in Christ. That's life-giving command number two, exhort one another. Verse 15, back to his Psalm 95 warnings. As it is said, so he's just now quoting himself from the earlier Psalm, today if you hear his voice, do not harden, there it is again, your hearts as in the rebellion. If you hear his voice, a.k.a. if you have ears to hear which is in and of itself a gift, praise God, don't harden your hearts. Don't be like the Israelites who rebelled. So we see again this oscillation between warning, life-giving command, warning, life-giving command. Verse 16 to 19, for who are those who heard and yet rebelled? Was it not all those who left Egypt led by Moses, right, the first generation, and with whom was he provoked for 40 years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest, but to those who were disobedient? So now we see, bleppo, that they were unable to enter because of unbelief. So he's just restating, right, who was it that fell? Who was it that failed to enter into God's rest? It was the Israelites. They kept provoking God for 40 years and it was because of their grumbling, their complaining, their disobedience, their idolatry, but most importantly and ultimately their lack of faith and their unbelieving hearts, verse 12 to 19, that they fell in the wilderness. They did not enter the land of promise. They did not enter into God's rest because of their unbelieving hearts, which they failed to see, bleppo. As a side note, quick parenthetical, notice what the author of Hebrews is doing, just to zoom it out real quick. He's continuing to build a case for the importance and the primacy of faith through this warning. And this theme of faith, hold on to it, because it will only get stronger and stronger and continue to crescendo until it takes center stage later on in Hebrews chapter 11. So that's a future date, but see what he's doing even now as that will segue us into the rest of the book. Let's keep going. Chapter 4, the warnings and the life-giving commands continue. Chapter 4, verse 1, therefore, in light of all that, while the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us fear, lest any of you should seem to have failed to reach it. And so it's actually here now that we find our third life-giving command. Let us fear. Let us fear. Dave just preached on this a couple weeks ago, the fear of the Lord. But what Dave shared from Exodus 20 and what the author of Hebrews shows us here is that fear, awe, reverence, and trembling is the appropriate response to the awesome power and the glory of God. What the author of Hebrews further shows us is that the fear of God is also a life-giving command as it enables us to enter into God's rest. How does it do this? How does that work? How does fear lead to rest? Well, as fear and faith in Christ come together, as humility and awe remind us that he is God and we are not, and as our neediness and our sonship unite to remind us of our righteous status before a holy God, by grace, through faith, we enter into God's rest, into his salvation. Similar to our previous two life-giving commands, this one, again, also takes on a corporate dimension. The Israelites, as the corporate people of God, they failed to fear and to enter into God's rest, the promised land. So the exhortation now for us is that we would learn from them, let us fear, us being a corporate church, us being a body, that we together, we might also collectively enter into God's rest and encourage one another into this. As a final encouragement from this verse, the author also says, fear the Lord even if you think you might have missed the opportunity, right? You who seem to have failed to reach it, take heart. And why can we take heart? Because his promises still stand. If you're hearing this message, praise God, there is hope. Fear the Lord, enter into his rest. So let us fear the Lord, our third life-giving command. Verse two, for good news came to us, just as to them, but the message they heard did not benefit them because they were not united by faith with those who listened. So both the Israelites and now the church have heard good news of entering God's rest as it was proclaimed to them, but for the Israelites, they did not, it says, benefit from this message, from this good news. Why is that? It tells us because they weren't united in faith, united by faith. Two important things here. Notice, of course, the faith component, right? They failed to have faith in Yahweh. They had, back to verse 12, unbelieving hearts, despite seeing his marvelous works and hearing the good news, which isn't just enough to just hear it, right, we have to respond. They weren't united by faith, by belief in God, but also notice that they weren't united. Again, see, the corporate component implied here is the people of God failed to be united in their common faith in the Lord. And so for us, the people of God, the church today, to function as God intended, there has to be unity in our gospel confession. Again, really practical for us here at Trinity Church of Loudoun, this is why we strive to preach the gospel and to preach Christ every week from our sermons. This is why we hold to our statement of faith and even discuss it and pray over it as elders. This is why we recite our church covenant at our member meetings. Unity through faith in the gospel leads us into God's rest as a corporate body, which will then sustain us as a church and make us fruitful for the kingdom. Unity through faith in the gospel leads us into God's rest as a corporate body, which will then sustain us as a church and make us fruitful for the kingdom. So that we would do what? So that we would be a blessing to the world, just like God wanted the Israelites to be. Verse three, for we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said, and he's quoting again now, as I swore in my wrath, they shall not enter my rest, although his works were finished from the foundation of the world. Who is it that enters God's rest? Well, again, it's those who have believed, if we haven't said it enough already. And because of Israel's lack of belief in God's promises, instead of rest, they experience hardening, which brings God's wrath, the opposite of rest. And then verse four, which is massive for us today, for he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way, and God rested on the seventh day from all of his works. Okay, so back in the beginning, we looked at chapter three, seven to 11, we looked at the nature of hardening and what it means to be hardened by sin. And now what we'll do is we'll look at its counterpart. We're going to look at the nature of rest, as this verse establishes rest as foundational to understanding salvation and faith. So God rested after creation, we see. Verse four is alluding to what we see, of course, in Genesis, chapter one. And many of us have probably heard that God's seventh day rest after creation is a model for us, and our resting as he rested, and that's certainly true. But it's so much more than a nice example for us to follow. It's a picture of how essential the idea of rest is in salvation, and how it is even eternal in its scope. How does Genesis do this? How does it model this for us? If you read through Genesis one and look at each of the days, you'll notice that each day ends with the same concluding statement, right? If you look at verse two, it says day one, God creates light, and he says there was evening and there was morning the first day. And then day two, God created the expanse, the heavens, and he says there was evening and there was morning the second day. Day three, God creates dry land and plants and says there's evening and there was morning the third day. Day four, God creates sun, moon, stars, and says there is evening and there is morning the fourth day. God creates birds and sea creatures and says there is evening and there is morning the fifth day. And day six, God creates animals and man and says there is evening and there is morning the sixth day. But on the seventh day, it says that God rested from his work, and then the text does something different. It gives us no concluding statement, no evening, no morning, no beginning, no end. It stands separate from the rest of the days, the days of work, not just in its content but also in its quality. Moses intentionally, Moses the author of Genesis, gives no beginning and no end to the seventh day as it is representative of the eternal nature of God's rest that he promises to all who believe in his name, which only further highlights the importance and the significance of rest and the call to enter into God's rest where he is, where he dwells forever. Furthermore, it's an invitation to enter into his rest from our own working, from our own striving and laboring, and from our own striving to find rest by our own means. This is why the author of Hebrews borrows from Psalm 95. So far in the sermon, we've looked at the end of Psalm 95 as the author of Hebrews quotes it, which includes our stark warning, but what of the beginning of Psalm 95? Matt read it for us right in the call to worship at the beginning, but it is if nothing else one of the clearest pictures of God's rest. Let's read it again, Psalm 95, one through seven. It says, oh come, there's the invitation, let us sing to the Lord. Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. That's even exhortive language right there. Let us come into his presence, us, corporate language, entering into his presence together. Come into his presence with thanksgiving. Let us make a joyful noise to him with songs of praise. For the Lord is a great God and a great king above all gods. In his hand are the depths of the earth. The heights of the mountains are his also. The sea is his, for he made it. In his hands form the dry land, creation language. Oh come, let us worship and bow down, fear. Let us kneel before the Lord, our maker. For he is our God and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand. Church, this, this is rest. This is what it looks like. We are called to believe and to enter in. And on the days when that's hard, even to cry out. Lord, help our unbelief. Help us because we know that you're too good to miss. And what Genesis 1 and what Psalm 95, as the author of Hebrews brings both of them in his argument, what they both highlight is that to be in God's rest is to be with God. Forever. Verse five. And again in this passage he said, they shall not enter my rest. Again, another warning. They did not enter his rest. But then verses six and seven. Say, since therefore it remains for some to enter it and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience, again he appoints a certain day saying, through David so long afterwards, in the words already quoted today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts. Again, there's hardening. But there's great hope in these verses. First, the promise of rest, as we said, it still remains. This is great news. This fact alone should catalyze us as a church to get to work, proclaiming the good news and calling people to believe the gospel and to enter into God's rest, to repent. This is why we, again, practically, Trinity Church of Laud, this is why we do things like serve at the shelter and invite our neighbors to church and why we plan on doing this upcoming Saturday some evangelism at 9.30 right here at the church. Little plug. The promise still remains so some may enter. There is work to be done. And then today, verse seven. Today is the day of salvation. The promise was there for Israel. It was there in David's day and it's here for us. The promise and the hope of God's rest still remains. This is amazing news. And then back to our warning again, right? He's oscillating. But don't harden your hearts. Verses eight and nine. For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken of another day later on so then there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God. For whoever has entered God's rest has also rested from his works as God did from his. Oh, sorry, verse nine. Let's do verse eight and nine. So first, Joshua. The one who after Moses, incredible warrior, brings the Israelites from the desert, wilderness and into the promised land. He's a man of valor. He's courageous. He's trusting of the Lord. He calls the people to be strong and courageous, right? Famously defeated the city of Jericho as well as much of the rest of Canaan. But as great as all that was, the Israelites finally reaching the promised land, it actually wasn't the ultimate rest that God's people are called into. It was a foreshadowing. There is a better, a future Sabbath rest for the people of God that is far greater and that is eternal. Remember Genesis one. A rest with infinitely more glory than even the rest in the promised land that Joshua led the Israelites into. The Israelites coming out of the wilderness they were hoping in and yearning for the rest in the promised land and again, they eventually made it. Praise God. And yet, as Hebrews tells us, this was not the ultimate rest. There is another day coming later on. Joshua could never give them the eternal, perfect rest in God that their souls longed for. But another would come one day centuries later who would go before us and by his work at Calvary would bring us into our true, eternal rest and into the perfect fellowship of God the Father. Of course, this is Jesus our Lord who came down from heaven fully God and fully man who died on a cross, taking upon himself the full wrath of God, wrath that we rightly deserved and should have received because of our sin. He died in our place and yet death could not defeat him. It could not hold him back as the infinite God man. He rose from the grave. He bore witness for 40 days to many witnesses including the disciples. He ascended into heaven and he is now seated at the right hand of God, the Father ruling and reigning. And when we place our faith in him, in his perfect righteousness, his finished work, we experience salvation. We are adopted into his family. We are made righteous in his sight. We are restored back into fellowship with God. We enter his rest. And then verse 10, for whoever has entered God's rest has also rested from his works as God did from his. So what salvation in Jesus brings to us is a new reality whereas new creations we can now rest from our striving, from our struggling. We find rest from our boasting in our own works, in our own accomplishments, building our identity upon them. And from the never-ending toil of being good enough and striving to earn God's favor. By faith in him, verse nine, we rest from our works, verse 10, as he rested from his. And then finally, verse 11, as we wrap up. Let us therefore strive to enter that rest so that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience. So this is now our fourth, our final life-giving command. Let us strive. Let us strive to enter his rest. Our final life-giving command, and we have to ask the question, what is the nature of this striving? What is the nature of our striving? Is it just trying harder? Right, we talked about resting from works as God rested from his works. So what does this look like? The great irony here is that our striving is not up to us. Again, this is not just boasting in ourselves and trying harder. It's a play on words, because what we're ultimately striving towards is rest. So what we're striving towards is not striving in our own strength. Kind of like Jesus saying, my yoke is easy and my burden is light. Well, that's ironic, because normally a yoke is heavy, and a burden is oppressive. But not with Jesus. As we come to him, all who are weary and heavy-laden, he gives us rest. As we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive, not just keep on condemnation. There is no condemnation. As we abide in him, he bears much fruit out of us. And as we follow him as our shepherd, he leads us to green pastures, to still waters, and he is with us in the valley. This is striving. And this is something that we do in community as a church. Let us, again, corporate component, let us strive lest we fall by the same sort of disobedience. And again, what was their disobedience? It was an unbelieving heart. It was a lack of faith. May we strive together in faith in our Lord Jesus. So our four life-giving commands that by faith in Christ lead us out of hardness and into God's rest. Take care, brothers. Examine yourself. Exhort one another, as long as it is called today. Let us fear and let us strive together to enter into his rest, church. Let's pray together. Oh God, most high, most glorious, the thought of your infinite serenity cheers me. For I am toiling and struggling, troubled and distressed, but you are forever at perfect peace. Your designs cause you no fear or care or unfulfillment. They stand fast in the face of adversity. Your unfulfillment, they stand fast as the eternal hills. Your power knows no bond. Your goodness knows stint. You bring order out of confusion. And my defeats are your victories. The Lord God omnipotent reigns. I come to you as a sinner with cares and sorrows to leave every concern entirely to you. Every sin calling for Christ's precious blood revive deep spirituality in my heart. Let me live near to the great shepherd. Hear his voice, know its tones, follow its calls. Keep me from deception by causing me to abide in the truth. From harm by helping me to walk in the power of the spirit. Give me greater faith in the eternal truths. Burning into me by experience the things I know. Let me never be ashamed of the truth of the gospel. That I may bear its reproach, vindicate it, see Jesus as its essence, know in it the power of the spirit. Lord help me. Lord, I'm often lukewarm and chill. Unbelief mars my confidence. Sin makes me to forget you. Lord, let the weeds that grow in my soul be cut at their roots. Grant me to know that I truly live only when I live to you. That all else is trifling. Your presence alone can make me holy, devout, strong, and happy forever. Abide in us, oh gracious God. It's in Jesus' name that we pray, amen.
