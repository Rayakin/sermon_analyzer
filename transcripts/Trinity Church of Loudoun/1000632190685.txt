Exodus chapter 20 verses 18 through 21. Now when all the people saw the thunder and the flashes of lightning and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking, the people were afraid and trembled. And they stood far off and said to Moses, you speak to us and we will listen, but do not let God speak to us lest we die. Moses said to the people, do not fear for God has come to test you that the fear of him may be before you that you may not sin. The people stood far off while Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was. This is the word of the of the Lord. We are well into the month of October now, approaching October 31st. And for good church types, that means we are approaching Reformation Day. That day in 1517 when a guy named Martin Luther, he nailed his 95 theses on the door of the castle church in Wittenberg, Germany. That's what the good church folks are celebrating. If you're in the Felton family, none of whom are here today, you know it as the day that both of your first two daughters were born, two years apart. How about that? But for the rest of at least this country, October 31st is Halloween, the spookiest of all the holidays. Now there's been plenty of debate over the years as to how or even whether Christians should engage in this holiday at all. I'm not here to settle that this morning. But what is undeniable is that along with all the candy and the fun costumes and the decorations, part of what makes this holiday so effective and even so intriguing to us is that it uniquely operates on that most basic human experience. Fear. Fear of the dark. Fear of the unknown. Fear of things and beings that we can't see or control. And every year businesses and county fairs and the whole media industry gets turned over to get more in the Halloween spirit. The Halloween film franchise, if you're familiar, Michael Myers, White Mask, they released their 13th film last year with probably more to come. Kings Dominion, the amusement park here in Virginia, they've been having their Halloween haunt since this past September. Their tagline on the website, fear is waiting for you. As the author Stephen King put it, I like to scare people and people like to be scared. We're fascinated by fear. And we've all experienced this kind of fear also. Whether it's from a scary movie or a haunted house or even just walking by yourself in a dark alley, we've all been spooked. We've all been made to jump out of our skin here and there. Is this the kind of fear we're supposed to have toward God? Is to live in the fear of the Lord, to live scared of him like this? If you haven't already, you can turn to Exodus 20. Brief passage that we'll look at today. Exodus 20, 18 to 21. And as you turn there, you may notice that this passage is right after a far more famous piece of text. Just before our text is when the Lord tells Moses the Ten Commandments from Mount Sinai. And this happens just a few months after they've been set free from Egypt. They've miraculously crossed the Red Sea. They've now set up camp in the wilderness in Sinai. And they're in front of this mount called Mount Sinai. And in chapter 19, the Lord tells Moses that for the next two days, he and the people are to consecrate themselves, to wash their garments, to prepare themselves. Because on the third day, Yahweh himself will come down upon the mountain and speak to the people directly. The people are to come to the foot of the mountain when he arrives. But they're not to go up to the mountain, they're not to touch the mountain or even the edge of it, or else they will die, God says. And so on the morning of the third day, the sky starts to rattle with thunder and lightning. And a loud trumpet blast signals for them to approach the mountain. So there's probably 600,000 Israelites gathered now that form the people of God. They all gather around this mountain and they are trembling. Mount Sinai, all 7,497 feet of it, itself is trembling. It is engulfed in smoke because the Lord has descended in fire. None of them has seen anything like this before. None of them has seen God do anything like this before, certainly not in a peaceful way. And through the thunder, the Lord calls Moses and Moses only to come up to the mountain, come up the mountain. And he tells Moses again, he warns Moses again to warn the people that if any of them break through to the mountain, if any of them come up, come up like I've invited you to come up, they will die. Man, woman, child, even beasts. Not even the priests can come up. And he sends Moses back down to remind them of that before he talks to them. And it's here, as we, as chapter 20 arrives, with Moses back down with the people that God speaks these famous words, through deafening thunder, lightning, crackling in the sky, smoke billowing around them, maybe even stinging their eyes. The Lord begins by telling them who he is, by reminding them that he is Yahweh who rescued them out of the house of slavery. Then he gives them his ten commands, ten orders for how they're to live as his people. They're his people now. They don't belong to anybody else now. They're not enslaved by anybody else now. They're his. This is how that should look in your lives. I wonder if you've thought about these commands recently. We'll read them together. Read along with me. Chapter 20, verse 3. You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself a carved image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them or serve them. For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments. You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter, your male servant or your female servant, or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy. Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land that the Lord your God is giving you. You shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his male servant, or his female servant, or his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor's. Words for all of us to live by, and words for all of us to be condemned by. And so the people respond. Verse 18, Now when all the people saw the thunder, and the flashes of lightning, and the sound of the trumpet, and the mountains smoking, the people were afraid and trembled. And they stood far off and said to Moses, You speak to us, and we will listen, but do not let God speak to us, lest we die. Moses said to the people, Do not fear, for God has come to test you, that the fear of him may be before you, that you may not sin. The people stood far off, while Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was. Two points this morning. Fear that stays away, and fear that draws near. Fear that stays away, and fear that draws near. The people have just heard God speak. They've heard God speak, in a way they've never heard before. Before this, what was the arrangement? God would speak to Moses, Moses would relay to the people whatever God told him to tell them. So if you look back in 19.3, we see this there. It says, They set up camp. Moses went up to the mountain to be with God. Only Moses went up to the mountain. And that's who God speaks to, and that's who he instructs. So the Lord tells Moses, Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, You tell the people of Israel. That's the pattern. God to Moses to the people. And in turn, how would the people respond? They would themselves talk to Moses, and he would tell their complaints primarily to God. It's been working just fine until now, but now God is suddenly changing things up. He wants to speak to the people himself. No mediator. And how do the people react? They're afraid. They're afraid. They're trembling. They're standing far off, if you notice. Yes, God warned them not to approach, but he didn't tell them to leave. He didn't tell them to create more distance between him and them. Now, if you consider the sheer amount of nature that is happening around them, it seems like a rather reasonable response to take a step back. The word there where it says flashes of lightning, there in verse 18, the word isn't actually lightning. It's the same word used for the torch that passes between the altars when God gives the covenant to Abraham in Genesis 15. That's the same word. So in this context, if we can maybe imagine that a little bit, it's not so much that it's flashes of lightning and thunder. It might be more like thunder and fireballs falling from the sky. So they take a step back. But we should think about what is happening here besides just the theater of nature. Who is it that is speaking to them? This is the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, their forefathers. This is the one who all their stories are about. The story of how he made promises to Abraham and still made him wait until he was a hundred years old before his son was born. The story of how after all those years of waiting, he still tested Abraham by asking him to sacrifice his son. The story of how that son, Isaac, would later on just be just like Abraham, lying about his wife. And how even after he gets found out, God still protects him. The story of how even later on, God uses Jacob's son, Joseph, to interpret Pharaoh's dreams and to save the land from famine. The one who is speaking to them is the one who has saved them throughout their entire history. And lest we forget, their very own recent experience has been that, has been the same. God sending a timid man named Moses to free them from centuries of slavery. Splitting an ocean open for them to miraculously walk through. Splitting rocks open for them to have water. Sending meat from the sky. Sending daily bread from the ground. This is their God. And they are his people. This God who has totally, personally taken care of his people. Who has shepherded them through their entire history as a people. He wants to finally speak with them directly. And there in chapter 20 verse 2, his first words are even reminding them how committed he is to them. That's who's speaking to them. And their reaction is to be afraid and to step away. Why? Why do they do that? Three reasons. The first reason is that they actually feel unsafe. Their lives feel fragile right now. They see smoke and fire and a mountain that's shaking. They hear crashing thunder. Their well-being feels a little threatened. They feel like it's a little safer back here. What their experience though should tell them is that the Lord is the safest place to be. Is he not? That it's the Lord who has been good to them. That they are his very treasured possession. He wants them to know who he is. And he wants them to just live like they were created to live. That's what their experience should tell them. But what their eyes and their ears are telling them is that this is a threat. They see fire, they hear thunder, and they forget who God has been to them. Who God has always been to them. In fact, they get it exactly backwards, don't they? The one who has kept them alive in absolutely miraculous ways is suddenly a threat to their lives. They have it completely backwards. He isn't safe, they feel. He doesn't have their best interest in mind, they think. Life now feels jeopardized. Better to keep away. We're going to take care of ourselves. Brothers and sisters, we do the same thing, don't we? Make no mistake, life is hard. Life does feel fragile. Many of your lives currently have felt vulnerable. Your life is hard in ways that no one else here understands. But when life gets hard, when you feel the heat come, how quickly do you end up leaving God out of it? I got to take it from here then, I guess. When money feels tight, when kids wear you down, when marriage is dissatisfying, when singleness is painful, when relationships feel fragile, when work feels meaningless, when success never comes, when your body breaks down, when loved ones die, when your life feels like it is smoldering, how automatically do you turn inward, away from God, away from the shepherd? Not only do we do this when life actually is hard, we do this merely by anticipating that life might get hard, right? When you fear that money might get tight, when you think your kids might not turn out, when you think relationships might sour, that your body might fail, that everything you want and love in life is fragile and insecure and desperate. One author put it this way, it's one thing to narrowly escape being hit by a car, it's another thing to now feel that you are vulnerable after the car has passed by. The anxiety of the fragility of life, what do you do with that? The Israelites, they were afraid, they stood far off. Second reason, second reason they were afraid, they're afraid of punishment. They've just heard God thunder out his will for them as his people and if they're honest, they know they have not measured up, right? They're guilty. Their feet were still wet from crossing the floor of the Red Sea. When they get thirsty, they get hungry and start grumbling. If you count the number of times the word grumble starts showing up from chapter 16 on, it's astounding. That now becomes their attitude toward life, grumbling, complaint. They grumble so much they want to go back to Egypt. They saw what God just did and they want to go back to the people who are now buried in the sea. They want to go back to Egypt where they at least were around bread and meat. Guess what else they were around? Other gods. First commandment. Images and likenesses of things in heaven and on earth. Second commandment. They wanted to go back to that. Just a few chapters earlier, chapter 16, a lot of them break the Sabbath very directly. Fourth commandment. They go out on the seventh day to collect manna after God explicitly tells them that there will be none to collect. They do it anyway. These are people led by Moses. What did Moses do? Murdered a guy. Sixth commandment. These are the people of Jacob as we saw just a week ago. Dishonored his father. Fifth commandment. By lying to him. Ninth commandment. To steal, eighth commandment, the blessing from his brother. Not good stock. Their leaders, their forefathers have been these kind of people. Do you think this over half million have all fared much better? In these months of tension and confusion? No. They have sinned. All of them have sinned in thought, in word, and in deed. They have all sinned against a blazing God as they now see. So, in fear, in self-preservation, in knowing their guilt, they step far away. They want to keep their distance and they hope God will do the same. Brothers and sisters, I wonder if you know that feeling. The feeling of recognizing your sin and recognizing who you've sinned against. The feeling of the depths of your sin and the purity of the one you've sinned against. The arrogance of your sin before the consuming fire who is the one you've sinned against. Even further, maybe this is more familiar to us, as you start hiding away in your heart, feeling the regularity and even predictability of your sin and starting to presume upon the forgiveness of the one you've sinned against. The self-excusing that comes from comparing your minor sins to others far worse sins and trusting that the one you've sinned against gives yours a pass, therefore. Feeling that you are helpless in your sin and that the one who you've sinned against has given up on you. Have you felt these things? We feel these things. We feel these things. And what do we do when we feel these things? When our lives feel fragile, when we know what our sins deserve, what do we do? We squirrel away from God. We believe we know better. We don't trust him. We know what he's capable of. Let's take a step back. Let's take a step back. The third reason they stay away. It's fascinating. The third reason is that they've misheard and so now misunderstand God. They've misheard and so now misunderstand God. Verse 19, they tell Moses, You speak to us and we will listen, but do not let God speak to us lest we die. So they feel vulnerable. They feel ashamed. They want to go back to how things were, even assuring Moses that, listen, we'll listen to whatever you say, man. What they don't want is having to do business with God directly because otherwise they'll die. In their fear, in their distancing, they assume that if God were to continue speaking to them, they will die. Except what's the problem? God has never said that. What he said was, in chapter 19, that if any of them broke through to the mountain, came up the mountain like Moses did, then they would die. Never said anything about them dying by him speaking to him. They have misheard God and so they misunderstand him. Can you hear the echo of the garden here? Same problem, all those centuries earlier. In the garden, God warns Adam, don't eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil lest you die. And yet, how does Eve respond to the serpent? We can't eat or even touch it or else we will die. God never said that. God never said that. Maybe Adam exaggerated what God said to her. Maybe he just wasn't clear when he told her. But in any case, Eve, what happened? Eve believed that. And by believing that, became persuaded that God is harsher than he actually is. Because she misheard, she now misunderstands. Same result here at Sinai. They misheard God, and now they think God is meaner than he actually is. That he's not as good, that he's not as trustworthy. He can't even talk to us because he's going to kill us. Friends, I bet that you could trace a lot of your wrong patterns of life to not hearing God's word properly. And from not hearing God's word properly, you make something up. And upon making something up, you start to actually believe it. There's never some clear template for how that happens or some obvious timeline. But it is a drift. And if left unaddressed, it gets really hard to unbelieve what was never true to begin with. God spoke to the Israelites about how he wanted them to live, but the Israelites now think him speaking to them will cause them to die. And so instead of developing their relationship, they distance themselves from fear. They have it completely backwards again. How about you? Observe your life. How about you? Observe your life for a second. Observe the ways that you distance yourself from God. What might those things suggest that you believe about God that might actually not be true? What are you afraid of about him? What are you afraid of about him that maybe you've made up? Of course, our environments, our upbringings all play a role in this, but we do need to see that our personal spiritual instincts toward God, our behaviors even, are nevertheless between us and God. It's always personal with him. Brothers and sisters, if you want to see God more as you should, if you don't like the Israelites as they see the fire and the thunder, if you don't want your life circumstances to so easily determine how you relate with God, observe your instincts. Follow them to see how you might deeply believe things about God, what you might deeply believe about God, and invite the Holy Spirit to accompany you, to apply God's word, God's actual word to you, to ultimately correct or improve what you believe that might actually be wrong. Observe your instincts, how you instinctively relate to God, understand God, conceive of him. Follow those down. See where, see the root of belief in God. Follow those down. See where, see the root of belief that they sprout from. Invite the Holy Spirit to do that work with you, to bring God's word to bear upon those things, so that if those things are actually rooted in things that are not true about God, he would replace that or improve that and correct that. This is the kind of work we need to do as we reflect on our own lives. This is part of why God has given us a faculty to be self-reflective, not just observant of the world around us. We are called to observe ourselves, to examine ourselves. That's part of that work. The alternative is to fall into the same patterns as the Israelites are experiencing, as we've all experienced in our own lives. It's to fall into the pattern of mishearing God's word, and so making something up and then really believing it. The Israelites, it's such an ironic example here, isn't it? God is speaking to them directly, is God speaking to them directly, is the exact solution to their problem. But because they've misunderstood him, his speaking to them is the very thing they want to avoid. You see that? God's speaking to them directly, so correcting the wrong thing they believed about God. That's what they need. But because they've now believed it so much, they don't want that. They don't want the very solution to their problem. We all do the same thing, because life feels fragile, because we fear the punishment of God, because we misunderstand him fundamentally, and so we're afraid of him, and we step away. That is fear that steps back. Now let's, for a few minutes, observe fear that draws near. Thankfully, there's another fear. Verse 20 and 21. Moses said to the people, "'Do not fear, for God has come to test you, "'that the fear of him may be done before you, "'that you may not sin.' "'The people stood far off, "'while Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was.'" One of the complications that I've felt this week, and perhaps some of you feel, with understanding the fear of God, is that at first glance, God seems to change, doesn't he? In the Old Testament, he can seem like this frightening, vengeful, even merciless being. And then comes Jesus in the New Testament, cuddly little baby, literally no teeth to even bite him, literally no teeth to even bite anyone with. So the first God feels right to fear. The second God feels wrong to fear. What's the solution? Like so many apparent theological problems, the solution is that God is one, and that God does not change. God is unlimited fullness, so nothing can be added to him, nor can anything be removed from him. He is utterly whole, eternally. Nor is God within time. Time is actually within God, if you can think about that. We can't really, but just accept it. God is not within time. Time is within him. So he never accepts time. He never experiences anything new, because there's nothing outside of him, not a force that's bigger or really of any size outside of him that could impact him, nor is there ever any future event that is future to him that could change or alter who he is. No. God is fullness of everything, always. What does that mean? That means that frightening God of the Old Testament is exactly the loving, gracious God of the New Testament, and vice versa. God the Son, who became a baby, born in Bethlehem. You know what he was doing millennia before that? With the Father and with the Spirit? He was destroying everybody but Noah's family in the flood. What does that mean? How does that help us understand God? How does that help us understand the fear of God? Well, ask yourself, how does even that last idea impact how you think about Jesus himself? We all have thoughts about Jesus. Christmastime is coming. How does the idea that that same God was that baby and also that destroyer change you, change how you think about him? If you hadn't thought about his Godness in that way before, at the very least, your thoughts about Jesus should expand a little bit. It's not, and it's not that, the result is not that Jesus's more well-known, more favored qualities are diminished. He's still the one who weeps over Lazarus's death. He's still the one who washes his disciples' feet. He's still the one who loves the worst of sinners. It's that as amazing as he is as God's nice version, he is even more amazing when we see the fullness of who he is as God. When we consider that he's also the God who sent the plagues that they just survived. When we realize that in both Exodus 3 to Moses and in John 8 to the Pharisees, it is Jesus who says both places before Abraham was, I am. Same God, same God. And so like with anything that perhaps far exceeds what we initially imagined, that should give us a sense of awe. 2007, summer. Some of you, a lot of you might remember it. Steve Jobs is on the stage. He said, today is a day I've been looking forward to for two and a half years. Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything. And it's right. Today, we're introducing three revolutionary products. People start cheering. There's video of this. The first one is a widescreen iPod with touch controls. Cheers. The second is a revolutionary mobile phone. And people literally start shouting at this point. Just cheer and anticipating what's to come. The third is a breakthrough internet communications device. Tepid cheers here. So they probably sequenced those three things wrong. Anyway. Three things, a widescreen iPod with touch, a revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough internet communications device. And he starts to slow down. An iPod, a phone, an internet communicator, an iPod. And then people start cheering because they know what's happening. A phone. Are you getting it? He asks. These are not three separate devices. This is one device. And just pure nerd pandemonium erupts. It's not even like I'm not even demeaning. It's genuinely pure. It's so beautiful to like witness. What are they realizing? This rectangle is unlike any rectangle we've ever seen. It can do more than any rectangle could ever do before. Any one of those three devices would have been revolutionary, would have advanced technology, would have advanced personal communication. This one is all three of them combined. They were in awe. We were all in awe, weren't we? Did anybody get the first iPhone here? Just curious. I'm too ashamed. Some kid raised their hand. Can't be true. That's the ninth commandment, man. That's the ninth commandment. The more we understand all that is in God, the more we are in awe of him. That's how it works. And that gives a little more texture, I think, that famous scene in Isaiah 6. Isaiah's vision of the Lord on his throne. The angels covering their faces singing, holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts. The earth is full of his glory. That kind of reverence isn't something that knowing Jesus makes unnecessary. It's seeing Jesus properly that produces that kind of reverence. Do you see that? Keep in mind, as one author notes, the seraphim, the angels, these creatures had known God and been in close proximity to him throughout time. Yet their response to his presence is extreme veneration. They were sinless. They had no moral shame, no need of repentance. Their knowledge of him and closeness to him far exceeds ours, and yet did not make him any less transcendent. It is seeing God properly that makes you bow, not straighten your back. The holiest of creatures, purer than us, more majestic than us, more intelligent than us, they choose to worship fearfully. Do your heart and mind ever recognize that God is the Lord of hosts? Ever recognize that God is that above you? Does your spirit ever do that? Our more common issue today is likely not that we think too much of God's greatness. We think far too little. Our problem is not that we are too timid, it's that we are too casual. The Hebrew word for fear there in our passage and throughout the Old Testament, that's far more than just a healthy dose of respect like can be thought of in evangelicalism. It just straight up means to be afraid and be terrified. That's what the word means. Friends, you and I are not angels. You and I are unclean people. And so that is bad news. You need to realize that every single moment of your life is lived before God. The walls of your house, the passwords on your devices, the privacy of your own mind, none of these things are actually barriers to God. In fact, the more personal a thing is, the clearer a window it is into who you actually are before Him. Do you have the gall to be careless? Before this God? To be ambivalent or even performative with your religion before a one who sees all? If so, you really might, like the Israelites, misunderstand. Yes, Jesus is the lamb. He is also a lion. Meanwhile, Moses, back in our text, while the people stand far off, what does Moses do? Fascinating. He draws near. The greatness of God, as we see, means that awe and fellowship are not opposites. In fact, they enrich one another. Therefore, they serve one another. They strengthen one another. Another example from scripture. The Apostle John. Four times in his gospel, he describes himself as the disciple whom Jesus loved. He's trying to show just how Jesus made him feel, just how beloved and known and safe and secure the Lord Christ made him feel. John 13, he describes himself as even leaning against him during dinner. And yet, in Revelation 1, as an older man, he tells us, I heard a loud voice like a trumpet behind me. I turned to see and there was one like a son of man. He was a man of great wisdom. I turned to see and there was one like a son of man. His hairs were white like snow. His eyes were like fire. His feet like burnished bronze. His voice like the roar of many waters. His face like the sun in full strength. When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. Same guy. Both same guys. And yet, love and awe. Reclining and trembling. Deep humility and drawing near. These things are not opposites. These things fill up what is missing in the other that is right for us to feel before a God bigger than the universe and who will not break a bruised reed. Same God. A God who we must fear for who he is without ever fearing what he might do to us. If you're in Christ, we ought to. It is right for us to fear and be in awe of who he is but we do not have to be afraid of what he might do to you. Because all he might do to you was done upon his son, God. He, most incredibly, is a God who at once condemns our sin and took our punishment. At the cross, we see the clearest picture and the widest panorama of God's attributes. Ferocious wrath towards sin and undeniable love for his own. Friends, if you've come and have ever been speechless before the cross, you have tasted the fear of the Lord. If you haven't tasted that, consider these words from Psalm 130 verse four. If you, O Lord, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand? But with you, there is forgiveness that you may be feared. Let's pray. Lord, we approach your throne. And Lord, we've for a few minutes now considered who it is with whom we are speaking. And we've considered who it is with whom we are speaking. And we've considered who it is with whom we are speaking. With whom we are speaking. And who it is from your very word that has spoken to us. Teach us, Lord, in our hearts and minds to not flee from your word, but to draw near that we might understand more richly and fully what it is to fear you rightly, to fear you as we ought, to fear you in a more wholesome way. Broaden our understanding of this that we might please you, that we might, in fact, draw near and be received by you. Thank you, Lord. Do this work even as we leave this morning. Humble us and also raise us up as you raised up John and told him to fear not, for in your hands are the keys to death and Hades. May we know you better. In your son's name we pray, amen.
