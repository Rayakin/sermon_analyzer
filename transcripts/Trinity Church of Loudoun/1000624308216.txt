The two holiest days in Israel. The 14th day of the first month of the Jewish calendar, Egypt, midnight. Every household is awake, and every household is awake for the screaming and for the crying, as every firstborn son of Egypt is dead. The Lord's destroyer has come in wrath. Israel is awake too in Egypt, but not wailing. Her sons are alive. Every Israelite household, twilight the night before, took a lamb, one year old, without any spot or blemish, and sacrificed the lamb, and then painted their doorposts and their lintels with the blood of the lamb, exactly as God had told them to. And so when the destroyer came, every household covered in the blood of the lamb was passed over. The 10th day of the seventh month of the Jewish calendar, Jerusalem, Yom Kippur. This day, the high priest entered into the holy of holies, and only on this day, and even for he, but once a year. And on this day, and in that sacred room, a bull was slain by the high priest for his own sins, and then sprinkled, the blood of this bull sprinkled upon the Ark of the Covenant. And then a first goat was also slain for the sins of Israel, not just the high priest, but for all of Israel, and again, sprinkled upon the Ark of the Covenant. And then finally, a second goat was also brought forth for the sins, again, of all Israel, including the high priest. This goat was released from the holy of holies, from the temple, into the wilderness. This was the scapegoat. Symbolically, carrying the sins of Israel away, and into the woods. The rituals performed, God accepts the sacrifice again. Israel's sins are forgiven for another year, again. Two holiest days in Israel. The Passover, and the Day of Atonement. In both cases, the blood, the blood of the animal sacrifices was applied to the people of God, and for the people of God. Nobody else, in either case, was covered by the blood. Not the Egyptians during the Passover, that's why their sons died. Not the Gentile nations during the Day of Atonement, that's why they were still under the wrath of God for their sins. And so, because of the blood covering the people of God, and so God forgave his people, under the covering of blood, and so God spared them from his coming judgment. The two holiest days in Israel. So far in this series, on the so-called doctrines of grace, so if you're here, you're coming back, I see a few students I haven't seen in a while, so good to see you. If you're here for the first time, maybe. We're in the middle, I'm in the middle, preaching through a series on the so-called doctrines of grace. And here's, if you haven't been here, here's what we've seen so far. Let me catch you up to speed. The first week, I showed you that God is way bigger than you or I ever imagined. And so, therefore, we have no rights over him, no rights to demand, to question him in such a way that we demand an answer. He must fit into our categories. He must fit all of our rules. He's beyond us, he's above us in every sense. God is way bigger than you ever imagined. Secondly, I tried to show you that you and I are way worse off than you ever imagined. So I taught you a doctrine of the church called total depravity. The Bible teaches there is no good, not even any potential for good, remaining in you or me after Adam's fall in which we've all fallen. And so that's why the Bible calls us, in Ephesians 2 and other places, dead. Spiritually before God, our souls, everything in us is dead. You and I are way worse off than you ever imagined. And then for a couple of weeks, last installment, I tried to show you that God has loved you. This is where we got to grace and we get to grace. It is a series on the doctrines of grace. God has loved you for far longer than you ever imagined if you are in Christ. In fact, the story of God's grace and God's love for you and for me in Christ began before time. So we looked together at the doctrine, taught really throughout the entire story of the Bible of election. Today, grace, as we continue looking at grace, today, grace comes into time and into space and into our world. And we're going to go together today, this morning, to another bloody scene, another holy day in Calvary. And we're gonna look together at the cross. And what I wanna show you this morning, here's my argument, I'll give it to you right up front. Jesus came to rescue those people who the Father had chosen before time. And Jesus' blood shed upon a cross in Calvary, secured them. That's what I mean by the title of this sermon, securing grace. Let me say all that again, it's a mouthful. Jesus came to rescue those people who the Father gave to Him before time, and by His blood, He secured them. So I'm gonna show you this morning that Jesus' death and Jesus' blood was aimed at a particular people, and so, therefore, it achieved its purpose. In other words, what I wanna show you this morning is that the cross actually worked. In the fullest sense, it worked. And I'm gonna show you this from two places. I've been off a couple of weeks. I'm so excited to come back. I've basically got two sermons that I'm gonna preach forever and ever and ever and ever. And if you're new and visiting with us this morning, I don't usually preach this long, but also I totally do. John chapter 10, if you have a Bible. John chapter 10, if you have a Bible, go ahead and turn there with me. This is where we'll camp out for the first part. These verses, this scripture that Caleb just read for us, the teaching of Jesus to His disciples about shepherds and sheep. So John chapter 10, I'm not gonna read them again for you, though we're gonna camp out here for a while. I wanna meditate upon these verses, John 10, 11 through 18, and I want us to receive together as a church all that Jesus is saying here to His church, including you and me if you belong to the church. I wanna make four observations about Jesus' words here. Four observations. Number one, all of them very simple, very obviously, I hope you can see in these verses in this text. Number one, Jesus is the good shepherd. Jesus is the good shepherd. Ancient Israel was an agrarian society, so crops and farms and shepherds and sheep. That's why the Bible is rich with metaphors of grains and fruit and fields and seeds and sheep and wolves and farmers and shepherds. The word that the Bible chooses, think about this, of all the words, of all the ideas, of all the pictures that the Bible could choose for the office and the role of pastor, the office of pastor, an office that I and others in this church carry, the Bible chose, God chose the word and the idea and the picture of the shepherd. What is a shepherd? Who are shepherds? What do shepherds do? Well, shepherds dwell among the sheep. Shepherds dwell among the sheep. Shepherds protect the sheep. Shepherds feed the sheep. Shepherds lead the sheep to safe pastures. That's the job in short, the summary, the role of the shepherd. They dwell among the sheep, they protect the sheep, they feed the sheep, and they lead the sheep to safe pastures, so you can get an idea, even from that basic description of what a shepherd is, of a pastor or an elder like my job description and maybe why God and the Bible went with that word and that picture. I have the great privilege of serving this church as one of the pastors of this church, so that means, among other things, my responsibilities include dwelling among the sheep. So think about that even. I can't be some figure. We're not to be just some figure up, some talking head on a screen that you just watch. No, we're supposed to live among each other, right? And to know each other. I'm to dwell among the sheep. I'm to protect and feed the sheep along with the other elders. We do that primarily by teaching, by good and pure teaching of God's word, as best we're able, and lead the sheep. We're to lead, but, so I'm a shepherd. I carry this office. I'm to mimic the role of the ancient agrarian shepherd, but, this is critical, the Bible is also clear that there's a greater shepherd, yeah? There's a greater shepherd. Let me read for you from a couple of places. First Peter five, you don't have to turn there, but this is what Peter says in his letter. As an elder, as a pastor, as a shepherd himself of a congregation, here's what he says. So I exhort the elders, the pastors among you, as a fellow elder, and as a witness to the sufferings of Christ, as well as a partaker in the glory that is going to be revealed, shepherd the flock of God that is among you. So here's instructions to pastors, including himself, shepherd the flock of God that is among you. Exercising oversight, not under compulsion, but willingly, don't do it because somebody's making you do it. Do it because you want to do it. As God would have you, he says, not for shameful gain, not for money or power or title or pride, but eagerly. Not domineering over those in your charge, but being examples to the flock. How are you supposed to lead, just by issuing out orders to everybody? No, being examples to the flock, being a godly follower of Jesus yourself. And listen to this, and when the chief shepherd appears, who's that, Paul? No, and when the chief shepherd appears, the Lord Jesus Christ, you will receive the unfading crown of glory. One more, Hebrews 13, 20, the conclusion to the letter of Hebrews. Now may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of the eternal covenant, may he equip you with every good that you may do his will, working in us, that which is pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever, amen. Do you see how, in both places, by Peter and by the author of Hebrews, Jesus is called the chief shepherd and the great shepherd of the sheep. So what does that mean? That means pastors like me, elders like me, are under-shepherds, hirelings, landlords, serving under, always, the great shepherd. We ourselves, sheep, first and foremost, under the great shepherd. I have a pastor, a great pastor, just like you all have a pastor. Jesus is all of our pastor, if you belong to the church of God, and that's not just a meaningless slogan. He's the pastor over all the church. What does that mean? That means he dwells among us. He protects us, he feeds us, he guides us, and he will bring us safely home. He will hold us fast. Your pastors will fail you. In some way or another, they all will, we all will. Some of you have been horribly failed by your pastors, hopefully not at this church, but some of you have been horribly failed by pastors, whether by false teaching or by abusive leadership. Those consequences, as you will acutely know, are devastating. But we, all of us, have a great shepherd who is also the good shepherd who will never fail us. And so if you hang on to your faith and even to the church after you've been horribly let down by a man, it will only be because you know that there is a greater shepherd who never fails us in the Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus is the good shepherd. The second thing I wanna show you from John chapter 10, the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. Look at verse 11. I am the good shepherd. What does that mean? The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep, Jesus says. He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd who does not own the sheep, well, he sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees. And the wolf snatches them and scatters them. He, the hired hand, flees because he's a hired hand and because he cares nothing for the sheep. I am the good shepherd, Jesus says. There's two things that you have to see here. Both of them are very clearly here in these few words. Observe together with me. Number one, the good shepherd lays down his life. Unlike the hired hands, the good shepherd lays down his life. So Jesus makes a contrast here between the good shepherd who is himself and the hired hand. And let me be clear, the hired hands here are not bad. They're not bad people. They're not bad shepherds. That's not what Jesus is saying at all. The hired hand also dwells among the sheep, watches over the sheep, feeds the sheep, guides the sheep, protects the sheep, up to a certain extent. That's the point. We hire babysitters for our girls as often as we're able to go out and have a night or whatever. And we have great babysitters. We've gotten some routines and the same people we call on all the time who love our kids and our kids love them. And I do think they do love our kids in some sense. So while we're away, they watch them, they feed them, they put them to bed, they protect them. But if it came down to it, God forbid, I do not expect that they would put their life, their life on the line for my children. Why? I'd like them to. I'd probably pay them a little bit more if I thought they would give up their lives for my children, but I don't expect them to. Why? Because they're not their children. They're my children. They're not their parents. They don't, they might love them in some sense, but they don't love them in the same way that mom and dad do. That's what Jesus is saying here. When the sheep are out grazing in a new field and there's a rustle in the nearby woods and then a growl can be heard and then another growl and then some beady eyes can be seen off in the dark and in the distance and then the awful realization awakens that you are surrounded and your sheep are surrounded by a pack of wolves. Well, the hired hand is out. He's picking up his staff and he's fleeing as fast as he can. Why? Because they're just sheep. He wants to protect them. There's significant financial loss on the line if he loses these sheep to the wolves. He might even like the sheep. He might wanna pet them and not mind the smell and everything else, but they're not worth losing his own life over for crying out loud. They're just sheep. Jesus, our shepherd, hears the growls, sees the eyes, perceives the threat, and he's telling you here that he positions himself between the sheep and the teeth of the wolves. He puts himself and his own body in harm's way. He's telling you that he gives up his own life to save theirs, to save yours. That's what makes Jesus the good shepherd. Second thing you have to see here beneath this second point, the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. For the sheep. Look at verse 11. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. If I could just highlight in your minds, in your eyes, right now, that last bit of that phrase, he lays down his life for who? For the sheep. He's laying down his life for the sheep, which begs the question, who are the sheep? Sheep here obviously stand for people. We're not talking about actual sheep. Jesus wasn't, in real life, a shepherd. So sheep obviously stand for people, but which people? All people everywhere? So Jesus lays down his life for everybody? Are the sheep here the Jews? So Jesus lays down his life for his own fellow countrymen, and that's it. Who are the sheep? Well, if we read the passage more carefully, Jesus actually answers the question for us, defining exactly who he means by the sheep. Look down in chapter 10 a little bit further to verses we haven't yet read, beginning in verse 25. John 10, 25, Jesus answered them, I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name bear witness about me, but you do not believe. Why? Because you are not among my sheep. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. Who are the sheep? The sheep, Jesus tells us, are those who believe. They are those who hear Jesus' voice, and they follow him. And here's the critical question. Why do they follow him? Because Jesus, the great shepherd, knows them. And so, they know him. Who are the sheep? The sheep are the people of God who have bowed to Jesus as their king, and who trust him and follow him as their shepherd. The sheep, in other words, are Christians. The sheep are the church. Are you among the sheep? By the way, this matches really nicely with what John says over in John chapter 17, with what Jesus says in John chapter 17 in the high priestly prayer. Jesus is praying to his Father, and listen to how he prays, and listen to how nicely this syncs up with what we're seeing here in Jesus' speech about his sheep and laying down his life for the sheep. John 17, we'll just read a few verses from this long prayer, beginning in verse five. He's praying, and he prays, and now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory that I had with you before the world existed. I have, watch this, I have manifested your name to the people whom you gave me out of the world. Yours, they were. Father, they were already yours, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word. Skip down to verse nine. I am praying, the prayer continues, I am praying, Jesus prays, for them. I am not praying for the world. I am not praying for the world, but I am praying for those whom you have given me, for they are yours. Now, put together John 17 with John 10, and what do you have? The sheep, if you put together Jesus' word throughout John, are the people given to Jesus by the Father. So let me ask a big question, for whom did Jesus die? Well, John's gospel, the entire gospel, answers that question in at least six ways. Here are the people for whom Jesus has died according to the entirety of John's gospel. He's died for, according to John, and according to Jesus, his sheep. He's died for, he's dying for his people. He's dying for the church. He's dying for the many, M-A-N-Y, the many. He's dying for the children of God, and he's laying down his life finally for his friends. Who does Jesus die for according to the gospel of John? His sheep, his people, the church, the many, the children of God, and last of all, his friends. Here's the point. Jesus, he's telling the story that began before time. Jesus has been sent by his Father. He's coming into this world on assignment for those people. He's searched them out, he's found them, he's called out to them, and they believed because the Father knew them before time. And Jesus has, at this point, he's going to lay down his life, give up his life as the good shepherd for theirs to save them. Paul says the same thing, Ephesians 5, 25. Christ so loved the church that he gave himself up for her. Who did he give himself up for? Who did he die for? The church. Third thing I want you to see from John 10. The good shepherd knows his sheep and they know him. The good shepherd knows his sheep and they know him. Look at verse 14. I am the good shepherd, I know my own, and my own know me. Just as the, this is amazing. Just as the Father knows me and I know the Father, so I know my own sheep and my own sheep know me. If you look back at the beginning of chapter 10, we didn't read these verses, but I'll show you how it's saying almost the exact same thing. Look at verses three and four. The sheep hear his voice, the good shepherd, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought all out, or sorry, when he has brought out all of his own, he then goes before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice. Isn't that a remarkable picture? A biblical scholar called Tim Laniac commented on Jesus and on shepherds really. Let me read for you an extended quote here. Attentive and careful shepherds became, you and I know nothing about shepherds. Anybody here a shepherd? I am. Not really though, not in that sense, right? I know very little about shepherds. Let Tim Laniac help us. Attentive and careful shepherds became endeared to their flocks. Responsible shepherds know every member of their flocks in terms of their birth circumstances, their history of health, eating habits, and other idiosyncrasies. It's amazing. Some of you are like that with dogs. That's unbiblical, but this is biblical. I'm just kidding. Just kidding. It is not, I'm still quoting. It is not uncommon to name each goat and sheep and call them by name. It is like dogs. One of the most striking characteristics of the shepherd flock relationship is that control over the flock is exercised simply by the sound of the shepherd's voice. Isn't that amazing? End quote. Sheep recognize and respond to the shepherd's voice. So another shepherd can come over, a really good shepherd from another town, and can speak the exact same words, the same commands to another shepherd's sheep, but the sheep will not respond in the same way. Why? Because they know their shepherd's voice and they respond to him uniquely. Listen, if you are a Christian, that is, if you believe and if you follow Jesus as your Lord, it's worth asking yourself, it's worth asking myself, how did you come to that point of believing, of following, of bowing, when millions, billions of others tragically never come to that point? At least they haven't not yet. Why you? Why did you believe? Are you smarter than others? More sensible than others? More humble than others inside? Have a, you just, I have a softer, more obedient will than others do? Or was there something else at play there? Something which you and I didn't even realize as it was happening? Something bigger, far bigger, something, a story far beyond us, a story which really began before time. Jesus came on assignment for a people who were given him by his Father. He searched them out, he found them, and he called out to them. He called out to you through a preacher, through a mom or a dad, or through a Sunday school teacher, through a friend, through a child, through reading the Gospel of John, or through reading the book of Ecclesiastes or Romans. He called out to you in one of a thousand ways and there was something about his voice that was familiar. His sheep recognized his voice. It drew them in, it drew you in if you're a sheep. It compelled you, it called you so you believed. Fourth, final observation from John 10 I wanna make for us here together. Fourth, the good shepherd has many sheep of many folds. The good shepherd has many sheep of many folds. Look at verse 16. And, Jesus says, I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also and they also will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock and one shepherd. There were many scandals in the earliest churches which we read about in the pages of the Bible, the book of Acts and those letters of Paul and others. We read about so many different disagreements, even scandals, controversies, which broke out in these earliest churches. Controversies over Jesus, over the apostles. Who's an apostle, who's not an apostle? Controversies over certain laws, over idols, how much power they exert, over certain foods even. What can we eat, what can we not eat? But, the biggest scandal, the biggest controversy which rocked the early church and which we read about the most in the New Testament was the scandal of the Gentiles. The Jews were the people of God, Israel. Israel was the people of God. Jesus was a Jew. Jesus was an Israelite. A Jewish Messiah, he claimed to be. His ministry in the gospels was dominantly to his own people, to the Jews. But, after he died and after he was raised again to life, he sent out his disciples and he sent them to the nations. To the Gentiles. That, the early church being sent by Jesus and going out to the nations, to pagans, rocked the early church. Many people could accept a man risen from the dead before they could accept a Gentile brother or sister as their brother and sister in the faith in the same church family. Rocked the early church. But, that's precisely, I want you to see, the invitation Jesus is already sending out and signaling here. It goes to everyone. That is, to Jews and to Gentiles. Here's, that's exactly his meaning here. I have other sheep, not of this fold. I must bring them in also. They will listen to my voice and there will be one flock, one shepherd. You here, who have listened to the gospel and followed Jesus as Lord, do you realize, do you recognize that you are a fulfillment of this promise of Jesus? You and me, Gentiles, pagans, are the sheep of the other fold that Jesus is talking about already here. This is wonderful news for us. You are and I am the sheep of other folds. That is, the not Jews, the not Israel. But, we've been made part of the one flock under the one shepherd. No longer defined by nation or lineage, but defined by what? One thing, defined by listening to the shepherd king's voice. By the way, this is precisely the point of so many other passages in the New Testament. Time does not permit, I'll just give you a taste. John 11, a chapter later in the same gospel, John favorably quotes a high priest and some words he makes about Jesus, a prophecy from the high priest. John 11, 51 and 52, he did not say this, John says, of his own accord, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation. All right, for the Jewish people, not done. And not for the nation only, but also to gather into one, listen to this phrase, the children of God who were scattered abroad. First Timothy four, verse 10, the apostle Paul, speaking of the hope we have in the living God says this. First Timothy four, 10. We have our hope set on the living God who is the savior of all people, especially of those who believe. What does Paul mean there by all people? Jesus is God, the living God through Jesus is the savior of all people. God is the savior of all people. What does that mean, universalism? So everybody ends up saved, there's no hell? No, he means the world, as in the nations, as in not just the Jews, all people, Jews, Gentiles, Armenians, Americans, all people. Jesus is the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. The good shepherd knows his sheep and they know him. And the good shepherd has many sheep of many folds or nations. This, if you're here this morning as a believer in Christ, these words are meant to comfort you. These are not words aimed at controversy, they're words aimed at comfort and they raise a question which I wanna spend the rest of the morning, I'm just getting started, I wanna spend the rest of the morning dealing with and that is this. Here's the question I wanna spend the rest of our time dealing with. In what sense, I said at the beginning, I was gonna argue this morning, I was gonna try to show you that the cross worked in the fullest sense. Here's the question I wanna deal with the rest of our time. In what sense did the cross work? Jesus is the good shepherd who lays down his life for the sheep. Obviously, he's speaking there of his death and of the cross. Well, in what sense did that death work? And I want you and I want to invite all of you to wrestle with this today. This is red meat this morning, right? This is big, hard teaching from the Bible but we're gonna wrestle with it together. In what sense did the cross work? Listen, Christians answer that question in one of two different ways. So Christians understand the cross in one of two different ways. All Christians believe in the cross, have their hopes set on the cross and so we're saved. But Christians answer that question of in what sense did the cross work in one of two different ways. You in this room here this morning who trust in Jesus probably understand that we could divide the room in half or maybe it'd be a two thirds, I don't know. You understand the cross in one of two ways and let me say clearly, no, this is not a matter of heresy or even a fellowship belonging to, meaningfully serving in this local church but it does matter and it is worth wrestling with so we're gonna do that together right now. Number one, some of you think that the cross made you savable. So heaven was closed, shut off to mankind and Jesus died and he bled in Calvary and that closed entryway to heaven, now something was opened up, a portal was opened up and now Jesus is there pointing the way, beckoning you, come in, come in, come in. See what I mean, the cross made you savable. It opened up a previously closed portal so that you can now get to God, get to salvation, get to heaven. The second way of understanding the cross, some of us think that the cross decisively saved a people including you if you're a Christian. Do you see the difference? Let me illustrate the difference just to make sure we're all on the same page. So you're stuck in a building with no exit and the building is rapidly burning down to the ground and you're in there all alone, helpless. Did Jesus, one, bust out a window, create a window where there was not one before and there he stands yelling, calling out to you, come out, come out this way, this is the only way out. Is that what Jesus did or did Jesus burst into the house, run through the flames, choke on the smoke himself and carry your helpless body out of the house and all the way to safety? Do you see the difference? Not a matter of heaven or hell or heresy but it matters. Do you see the difference? Did the cross and the blood make you savable or did it really save you? I wanna close this morning by turning to the book of the New Testament which more than any book in the entire Bible deals with this issue, deals with the issue of atonement, deals with the issue of how the cross worked. So if you'd like to follow along with me, turn with me to the book of Hebrews. Hebrews, the book of atonement. There's one thing I wanna show you with the rest of my time from all over the book of Hebrews. I'm gonna preach the entire book of Hebrews with the rest of my time. One thing I wanna show you and it's a thread running throughout the book and the thread is simply this, the atonement worked. The cross worked in a way that nothing had ever worked before in dealing with sins. No blood had worked in this way before in dealing with sins. That's the course of this entire book of Hebrews. The cross worked beginning in chapter one. So look with me, chapter one verse four. I'm gonna do a sort of tour de force through Hebrews. Chapter one verse four. After making purification for sins, he, Jesus, sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high. Our journey begins here where Jesus is pictured as a high priest who by his offering, he makes purifications for sins. So you and me, all of us, wicked hearts, wicked defiled minds, consciences, defiled bodies, ours. This is us, this is our story. Way worse off, remember, than you ever imagined you were. All of us in Christ washed clean, spotless. Consciences, bodies, inside out, washed spotless on the cross and after doing so, the author of Hebrews says he sat down at the right hand of the Father. Why did he sit down? Hebrews is clear, the image of sitting down equals his work was finished, final, forever, completely. That right there is the chorus of the entire book of Hebrews and let's watch now how many different times and how many different ways the author of Hebrews is going to make almost the exact same point. Flip all the way over for the sake of time to chapter seven. Someday I'm really gonna preach Hebrews when I'm old enough. Chapter seven, 23, I'll pick up in verse 23. The former priest, he means the priest under the old covenant. The former priests were many in number because they were prevented by death from continuing in office but he, Jesus, holds his priesthood permanently. Why? Because he continues forever. Consequently, he is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him since he always lives to make intercession for them. For it was indeed fitting that we should have such a high priest as he, holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens. He has no need, Jesus, like those other high priests, to offer sacrifices daily, first for his own sins and then for those of the people since he did this once for all when he offered up himself. Listen, again, you sin daily. So do I. Hourly, minutely, in some way. What sins have you committed since I've started this sermon? Don't answer out loud. It's also not funny. These sins incur, deserve, cry out for the wrath, the very wrath of a holy God. Our sins are against him. And we constantly fill up our quota in sin. Israel was the same as you and me. Bad hearts, bad thoughts, bad actions. And so the priest, the high priest, offered blood daily, weekly, and the high priest, the day of atonement, once a year. There was a sense in which those blood offerings, bulls, goats, saved the people in that they deflected for a time the wrath of God. So God really did accept that blood and those offerings for that moment, for that day, until tomorrow, until next year when there would need to be more blood and more sacrifices offered to God, why? Because there are still more sins. But put your eyes, beloved, put your eyes on verse 25, where we read that Jesus, the great high priest, the fulfillment of those shadows, saves to the uttermost. What does that mean? It means completely, forever, totally, done. Why? Because he was perfect, he was innocent, he was holy, he was unstained, and he, the perfect holy one, offered up himself, and so it worked. It was the ultimate sacrifice, saving to the uttermost. Isn't that good news? Chapter nine, keep going. Chapter nine, beginning in verse six. Few more, few more glimpses, and I'll wrap up. These preparations, having thus been made, the priest, we're back on the same subject. Those old priests, and how many they were, and how busy they were. The priests go regularly into the first section, performing their ritual duties. But into the second section, the holy place, the most holy place, only the high priest goes, and he but once a year, and he not without taking blood, which he offers for himself first, and for the unintentional sins of the people. That's right, there is blood offered for the sins you didn't even mean to commit. Skip down to verse 11. But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and more perfect tent, not made with hands, that is not one of this creation, he entered once for all into the true holy places, that is heaven above, not by means of the blood of goats and calves, but by means of his own blood, thus securing an eternal redemption. An eternal redemption. Hebrews pictures Jesus here as the lamb of God, offering his own body and blood upon the cross, and then marching into heaven as a slain lamb to present himself, his own body, as a sacrifice to his father. He makes his offering, Hebrews is saying, and he makes it once, and in so doing, in this one single offering to his father in heaven, he secures an eternal redemption right then and right there before you were even born. You do not, I do not, I don't think the Bible teaches, activate his blood when you believe. His blood was offered at Calvary, and eternal redemption was secured then. Continuing on in chapter nine, I've gotta speed up. Chapter nine, verse 24. Verse 24, for Christ has entered, not into holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf. Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own, for then he would have had to have suffered repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment, so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, so he will appear a second time, not this time to deal with sin, but this time to save those who are eagerly waiting for him. He does not, again, same point again and again and again, he does not offer himself over and over and over. He offers himself once. Why? Because it worked. Chapter 10. Chapter 10, verse 11. Almost done. And every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. It can never take away sins. But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God, waiting from that time until his enemies should be made a footstool for his feet, for by a single offering, he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified. By a single offering, he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified, those who are being saved. It worked, it worked, it worked, it worked. For all time, it worked, is what I'm trying to show you. Sometime around the year 33 AD, on a Friday afternoon, on the 14th day of the first month of the Jewish calendar, Passover, around 3 p.m., with just a few random people hanging around and watching, some of them crying, some of them keeping guard, most of the world not noticing. A man in that moment, 3 p.m., right around then, breathed his last breath. And in that moment, the Bible teaches, the temple curtain was torn in two, and heaven itself was pierced because a sacrifice was offered in that moment, unlike any before it or any since, from a perfect man and thus fully satisfying, even quenching the wrath of a holy God, and so washing hundreds and thousands and millions of his sheep, who would someday, in the future, hear his voice and follow and obey, for they were his, and he was sent for them, and he died for them, and he cleansed them for all time, it worked. Hallelujah, it worked. It's on this basis, it's because of Christ's sacrifice upon the cross, that the writer concludes, chapter 10, 19, therefore, brothers, sisters, since we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus, by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh, and since we have a great high priest over all the house of God, let us then draw near with a true heart and full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. It's on this basis that heaven sings, Revelation 5, 9, and they sang a new song together around the throne, saying, worthy are you, O Lamb of God, to take the scroll and open its seals, for you were slain, and by your blood, you ransomed people for God, from every tribe and language and people and nation. Charles Wesley, that's John Wesley's brother, who wrote many of the greatest hymns ever written. A lot of the hymns we sing today, even this morning, were written by Charles Wesley. Hark the herald angels sing, and can it be, Christ the Lord is risen today, come thou long-expected Jesus, O for a thousand tongues to sing, and on and on and on. In his early 30s, he got really sick, and he lay in bed struggling with doubts about his faith, about his soul. He lacked assurance, and to remedy his doubts, he told a visiting friend that he intended to strive even harder for God, which he'd been doing for a long time. So more good works, more religious exercises. His friend shook his head disapprovingly, telling him that he was missing the point, which angered Charles Wesley. He journaled, are not my efforts a sufficient ground of hope? Would God rob me of my efforts? I have nothing else to turn to. Sometime later, still bedridden, another friend brought Wesley a copy of Martin Luther, the reformer guy from Germany, his commentary on Galatians. And he read, Charles Wesley read Luther's words on Galatians 2, and on the Christian life consisting, Martin Luther wrote, in personal pronouns. So, Christ loved me, and gave himself for me, Galatians 2.20 says. Charles Wesley wrote that he realized that Christ, in this moment, hadn't died, this is my words, not his, hadn't died for a faceless, anonymous blob of hypothetical people, but for names, including his. He found his heart strangely warmed by the love of Christ, and his doubts blew away like the wind. God had, as he understood it, saved him. Now, I wanna read for you, as we close, I wanna read for you what Wesley read from Martin Luther's commentary on Galatians 2. We're gonna read it with him, and I wanna invite you to personalize with Charles Wesley. Galatians 2.20, I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. In the life I now live in flesh, in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. Here's Luther commenting on these verses. Who is this me? I, wretched and condemned sinner, dearly beloved of the Son of God. If I could by work or by merit somehow earn the love of God and come to him, why should he have sacrificed himself for me? Read the words, me, and for me, Luther says, with great emphasis. Print this, and I wanna say this to all of us, print this me with capital letters in your heart, and do not ever doubt that you belong to the number of those who are meant by this me. Christ did not only love Peter and Paul. The same love he felt for them, he feels for us. If we cannot deny that we are sinners, we cannot deny that Christ died for our sins, end quote. When I asked my wife to marry me many years ago, I did not say, ahem, I'm extending an invitation to you, Natalie, to marry me. I've actually sent it out to several other lasses in all the lands, but you're one of them, and if you respond, I'm yours. No, I said, will you marry me? That's what the cross is. There's a you in Christ's sufferings. We're gonna sing in just a moment. My name is graven on his hands. My name is written on his heart. My name, your name, me, the name of every one of the sheep from every fold, can you sing that this morning? If you're here this morning and you're not a Christian or you're unsure about following Jesus, his invitation is for all and for every nation, and I extend it to you now this morning. Believe in Christ. Be washed by his blood and follow the king. You can rule your own life, live as you please, try to be a good person, try to be a really rebellious person, or you can bow to the king, who is the great shepherd of the sheep, who lays down his life to save his sheep and then takes it back up again, victorious over death. He's worthy of you following. If you're here this morning and you're a follower of Jesus, this teaching, I admit, is difficult and long, but it is for your comfort and it is for your assurance and mine, the cross worked in the fullest sense. Sins were paid for, atoned for in heaven, completely at that moment. Souls were secured at Calvary. Not potentially, really, fully, forever. Don't you wanna believe that? God, thank you so much for Jesus, the great shepherd of all the sheep. God, we pray for this powerful ministry of Jesus in calling sheep home from every nation. We pray that it would continue in power this very moment in every nation, even ours. God, send forth your gospel. Send forth your word. Send forth your spirit and bring many captives home. And God, for us who are following you as your sheep, often stumbling, often backsliding, often tripping up, often failing, we all are, oh God, Jesus Christ, great shepherd of our souls, would you bring us safely home? And we pray all these things in Jesus' name, amen. Amen.
