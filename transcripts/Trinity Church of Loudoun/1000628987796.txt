Matthew 28 verse 16 to 20, Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountains which Jesus had directed them. And when they saw him, they worshipped him. But some doubted. And Jesus came and said to them, All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always to the end of the age. This is the word of the Lord. Oh, Lord, you have searched me and known me. You know, when I sit down and when I rise up, you discern my thoughts from afar. You search out my path and my lying down, and you're acquainted with all my ways. Even before a word is on my tongue. Behold, oh, Lord, you know it already altogether. You him me in behind and before me. You lay your hand upon me. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me. It's too high. I cannot attain it. Where shall I go from your spirit? Or where shall I flee from your presence? If I ascend up into heaven, you are there. If I make my bed down in Sheol, you're there. If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there your hand shall lead me and your right hand shall hold me. If I say surely the darkness shall cover and hide me and the light about me be night, even the darkness is not darkness to you. The night is as bright as the day, for darkness is as light for you. That's Psalm 139, David's psalm of delight in the presence of God. He's writing, he's singing, he's wondering, he's laughing at the presence of God. You're everywhere. Anywhere I go, anywhere I could possibly go, you're still there. You're always with me. When was the last time you felt, experientially felt, the presence of God in your life? When was the last time you knew and felt the joy of your salvation? When was the last time you encountered the peace that only comes from the presence of God, even and especially in trying circumstances? When was the last time you encountered what R.C. Sproul called the trauma of his holiness as we encounter him and his blazing perfection and purity? Have you ever known the presence of God? Do you want to know God? Do you want to see and even, if I could say it like this, do you want to feel God and encounter his presence once again or maybe for the first time? Jesus has just been raised from the dead and arranged for the 11 remaining disciples to meet him in the hills of Galilee where he has just claimed all authority in heaven and on earth. On the basis of his all authority in heaven and on earth, he has now sent out his followers, the original 11 disciples, and every single one since he has now sent them out onto a mission into all the earth. This morning we conclude this three-week journey through the Great Commission, Matthew 28. If you're not there in your Bible you can go ahead and turn to the very end of Matthew's Gospel. That's the first, that's the first book in the New Testament, the second part of your Bible. It's towards the end of the Bible. This morning we conclude our three-week journey through the Great Commission. A radical claim we looked at together the first week as Jesus claimed before the 11 and as recorded for all of history. All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. King of heaven and earth, Jesus claimed. Radical claim. A radical mission he then sent them and sent us on. We thought about that last week. He sent them out into all the nations to make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them, teaching them to observe all that he has commanded everyone and everywhere. And Jesus concludes the Commission and also the Gospel of Matthew this morning with a radical promise. Matthew 28 verse 20, Behold I am with you always even unto the end of the age. It's an astounding promise as Jesus departs. Ironically it's a promise of presence as he's leaving. Just think about that. Just think of kids as mom or dad's walking out of the door. I'm going by. I'm promising you my presence forever. That's what Jesus does here and that's what I want us to meditate on together. This amazing promise. I want us to see it and believe it and live like it's true that Jesus really is with us always. I want us to experience it. I want you to experience this promise from Jesus to be with you always and forever wherever you go. I want us to experience it together as a local church. Jesus is with us always even unto the end of the age. And so we'll meditate together on this promise. Jesus promises two things here. You can see plainly in this one little verse. Number one, an empowering presence. And number two, an eternal presence. He promises to be with them always and his promise contains an empowering presence and an eternal presence. So let's meditate together on this promise which serves as the end of Matthew's gospel and as the end of our little series together as a church on the Great Commission. So first let's consider the empowering presence, the helping, the assisting, the enabling presence that Jesus is promising to those disciples and to all of us. What an impossible task he gave them last week. Verse 19 and 20. Go into all the nations and make disciples of all of them, teaching them to observe everything I've ever commanded you. That they might obey. I wonder how many of you maybe felt that afresh last week. What an impossible task. Where to even begin and what hope do we possibly have? Friends, this is an impossible task. It isn't a hopeless task if not for this promise attached to it. People are uninterested in the gospel. People are bored by the gospel. People are offended by the gospel. Have you ever tried to make disciples? Did Jesus not know? He did know. He said earlier in the same gospel of Matthew to his disciples, you will be hated by all the nations for my name's sake. You'll be hated, he says, by all the nations for my name's sake. And then he concludes the gospel by saying, hey, go out into all the nations, the ones who will hate you, and make disciples of them all. It is, this is very much, Jesus did know and he sent them out anyways on an impossible mission to accomplish an impossible task were it not for this promise that he attaches to its end here. Behold, some of the older translations have lo, L-O, behold, the final sentence in this gospel of Matthew ends with a startling word, behold, inviting you to stare and wonder at what Jesus is about to say. You don't think he knew that this moment was so critical? You don't think he knew how critical this final word was about to be given this impossible mission that he's just sent them on? Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age. Their hope and their success in this mission, our hope, our success in this mission still today, entirely depends upon this promise. On their own, they have no shot. They're just 11 guys and some of them are still doubting, remember Matthew 28 records. Some of them are still doubting him, even as they see him resurrected from the dead. But if Jesus goes with them, then how could they possibly fail? He's just defeated death and claimed all authority in heaven and on earth. How could anyone fail if he's with them? That's why after these parting words from Jesus, they don't just, and they didn't just, the disciples immediately dispersed north, south, east, and west and go to all the nations and make disciples to the nations we go. They didn't just go out immediately and obey this command. What'd they do instead? Instead, they went to Jerusalem, upon Jesus' orders, and they waited. And that's where the book of Acts picks up and tells us, while they're waiting and staying together, where he had ordered them, Acts 1-4 says, not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which he had said, Jesus had said, you heard from me, John baptized with water, but you will be baptized by the Holy Spirit not many days from now. In verse 8, Jesus said, you will, this is Acts 1, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be then with his power my witnesses in Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria and to all the ends of the earth. So he tells them to wait, don't do anything yet, just wait until he sends them the promised Holy Spirit, who he had been promising them for some time now, he said earlier in the gospel, when I go, he said, it's actually better for you because I will send another to you, another one called the helper, an enabler, a comforter, an empower. You will receive power when he comes upon you, Jesus said, so wait, and then we read in Acts chapter 2 verse 1 that when the day of Pentecost arrived and when they were all together in one place, suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting, and divided tongues as a fire appeared to them and rested on each of them, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit. Listen, it's critical that you put these things together. I want you to put something together here. Jesus promised in the Great Commission that he would be with them always, no matter where they were, what nations they went to, no matter how they were oppressed, no matter how outnumbered they were, he promised that he would be with them always, and then upon leaving them, he sent forth his Holy Spirit who came upon his followers in power. You have to put those two things together. Do you see? There's an intimate connection and unity between the Holy Spirit and the Son of God, Jesus Christ, and you see this borne out through the rest of the New Testament. Let me just give you a sampling very briefly. Acts 16 verse 7. I want you to notice how through Acts, and Paul later, and the letters he wrote throughout the New Testament, I want you to see how they speak of the Holy Spirit, and watch this connection bearing out. Acts 16 verse 7, and when they had come, some of the disciples had come up to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them. Romans 8, 9. Anyone, Paul says, who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. Philippians 119. Yes, and I will rejoice, Paul says, for I know that through your prayers and by the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, this will turn out for my deliverance. Galatians 4, 6. And because you are sons and daughters, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, by whom we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit, I want you to see, is often called what? Who? He's called repeatedly the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of the Son, the Spirit of Christ. There's an intimate connection here, do you see it? Then the Spirit of truth comes, Jesus told them earlier. When he comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own authority. But whatever he hears, he's speaking of the Spirit's ministry later after he leaves, he says that whatever the Spirit hears, he will speak and he will declare to you the things that are to come. He, the Spirit, will glorify me, Jesus says, the Son, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you. That's John 16. Listen, the Son is not the Spirit, and the Spirit is not the Son. But there is such an intimate connection between the two, that when the Spirit comes, when the Holy Spirit comes, Jesus is thereby fulfilling his promise, Jesus promised, to never leave nor forsake his disciples. Do you see? In John's Gospel, when Jesus returns and embraces the disciples after he's raised from the dead, he sends them out. So another great commission. But John tells us that right before he sends them out, Jesus breathed on them, saying, receive the Holy Spirit. This was, that was a new beginning, a sign and a promise of what was coming, and which, that which came in full at Pentecost. Jesus remains with his people and empowers his people through the Holy Spirit. You have to see that in the Bible, you have to know that in your own life. Jesus fulfills his promise to remain with his people forever, and empower his people in everything they do through the sending of the Holy Spirit. Friends, that is the only explanation for what then happens in the book of Acts, and what has borne out through subsequent human history. The only explanation for what happened is that Jesus came through on this promise in filling his people with the Holy Spirit. And so we read in the book of Acts that the Spirit of Jesus repeatedly directed the disciples. Like the director of a play ordering the actors on the stage, and the actresses, and or conducting all the affairs, overseeing everything, Acts 8 29, and the Spirit said to Philip, one of the later disciples, go over and join this chariot, the Spirit says, and Philip obeys, and there he finds an Ethiopian eunuch reading Isaiah 53, longing for somebody to explain it to him. Acts 16 7, we read it just a moment ago, and when they had come, the disciples had come to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them. Do you see that? You see the Holy Spirit directing the affairs of the disciples. Sometimes he, the Spirit, says, go here. Other times he says, no, no, no, stop, don't go there. He's directing everything they do. The Spirit of Jesus, we read in subsequent history, gave words to the disciples, which is exactly, by the way, what Jesus had promised. Mark 13 verse 11, and when they bring you, Jesus said to his disciples, when they bring you to trial and deliver you over, don't be anxious beforehand what you are to say, but say whatever is given to you in that hour, for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit. And that's exactly what happens in the in the book of Acts. Acts 6 10 says of Stephen, as he's standing before a mob who is about to kill him, we read that they, the mob, could not withstand the wisdom and the spirit with which Stephen was speaking. The Spirit directs them, the Spirit gives words to them, the Spirit of Jesus saves souls through the witness of the disciples. That's the story of Acts. Acts 2 47, and the Lord, the Lord added to their number, day by day, those who were being saved. Acts 18 9 and 10, and the Lord said to Paul one night in a vision, do not be afraid, but go on speaking, and do not be silent, for I am with you, I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many in this city who are my people. The Acts of the Apostle, that's the title your Bible, my Bible, has given to this book that comes after the Gospels, the Acts of the Apostles. It might be better entitled the Acts of the Holy Spirit through the Apostles. It might be even better titled than that, the Acts of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, through the Holy Spirit, who he sent to empower the Apostles. I suppose that's why they don't let me name these books, so that would be entirely too long. 11 became 11, became thousands, and Jerusalem, and a little house, and a room in Jerusalem, became the ends of the earth, all entirely because Jesus kept this promise. Do you see it? An impossible task, even for the bravest and most gifted of men, even for the most daring of women, and yet 2,000 years later, here you are, and here I am, here we are, so many of us disciples of Jesus. What a miracle! And Redeemer Fellowship of Kuwait City gathered to worship Jesus as disciples this past Friday morning, and Prasoon's little still-forming Emmanuel Church of Delhi in India gathered to worship Jesus some nine and a half hours ago this morning, and the Trinity Church of Minsk in Belarus gathered to worship Jesus as his disciples seven hours ago this morning, and the Holy Trinity Church of Warsaw in Poland gathered to worship Jesus as his disciples six hours ago this morning, and the Hope Church of Bingham gathered together in the schemes of Scotland to worship Jesus five hours ago this morning. Those are just our friends. All over the world, this very moment, all over the United States of America, disciples are gathering to worship Jesus because the impossible mission of making disciples of all nations has been made possible and is still being made possible by the presence and the power of Jesus through his Holy Spirit, empowering the church's mission and ensuring its success. It's a miracle. It's all a miracle. You're a miracle. And so what about you, and what about us together as a church, and this mission together as a church? What are you most afraid of as we think about the task that Jesus has sent us all on to make disciples of all the nations? What are you most afraid of? Is it the right words? What if I don't know enough? What if I'm not that confident speaking with people? What if they say something I don't have an answer for? He will be with you, he promises, and he will give you the words. The lost do not need Einsteins. They just need men and women who care enough to speak and who love enough to fumble over words, all to share of the resurrection of Jesus and of the hope of salvation. Is it rejection? Are you most afraid? So many of us are just afraid of rejection. He will be with you, even when you are rejected, to strengthen you and comfort you. He himself was rejected. For his message which we bear. Some of you, I bet, have followed Jesus for a long time now, and it's possible you've never shared the gospel with anyone before. And I imagine if that's you, there's probably a bit of shame there, and maybe even more than that, resignation. You've just resigned, that that's not you, and you will never be that person who just speaks about Jesus. But God can empower you too. Don't resign in that. Don't give yourself up to that. You just have to trust this promise, like we all do. Jesus will be with you. You have to believe that Jesus is going to be with you. If you're ever gonna go, if you're ever gonna open your mouth, you have to believe that he'll show up, and he'll help you, and he'll empower you, and he will. Put this, I invite you and us together as a church, put this promise to the test. This week, this afternoon, pray for God to fill you with his presence, empower you by his spirit, and let's join together on the mission. Acts 14 verse 27, Paul and Barnabas are sent out, they've been sent out on a mission to the Gentiles to share the gospel, they return back to the church in Antioch, which is home base at this point, and they return, and this is what we read upon their return to Antioch, and when they arrived and gathered the church together, they declared, Paul and Barnabas, all that God had done with them and through them, and how he, God, had opened a door of faith for the Gentiles. What a scene that is. Next Sunday night, we have our monthly prayer meeting. We call it Hymns and Prayers. Oh how I long for those meetings to be that. Do you know what I mean? Oh how I long for that. We just go around the room and share. One shares how God opened a door at this school, another shares how God opened a door with this neighbor, another shares how God opened a door at this office place in that country for that church plan, and on and on we go as we all testify together that God came through on this promise yet again like he always has. On your own, you have no shot. I have no shot, but with Jesus' power, with Jesus' all-authority in heaven and on earth, power, King of kings and Lord of lords, how can we fail? It's an empowering presence, and secondly, I want us to meditate together finally on this promise of Jesus and how he promises an eternal presence. Look at the words again in Matthew 28 verse 20, and behold I am with you always, always, to the end of the age. The most significant word in the Great Commission, which we've studied now for three weeks, might just be that little tiny three-letter word, all. I said this before, I'll say it again. There are four, same word shows up four times in these three verses which make up the Great Commission. The same word, all. Jesus claimed all authority in heaven and on earth in verse 18. Jesus then sent them out on the basis of his authority to all the nations in verse 19. He sent them out to teach the nations to observe all that I have commanded them in verse 20, and then one last time he finishes with this promise to be with them and us always, and the passage literally says in the original, all the days. All authority, and so go to all the nations, teach them all that I have commanded you, and behold, lo, I will be with you all the days. The presence of God is a really big deal in the Bible. You're not the first person to wonder about it, to want it, to long for it, to miss it. Ever since Eden, since man and woman was banished from the presence of God in the garden, we've all ached for the presence of God, even when we had no idea that's what we were so longing for. That is, the presence of God is the satisfaction to every single craving you and I have ever had. Ever since we lost it, we've longed for it, mostly without knowing it, and the story of the Bible as it goes shows us these special servants who were chosen especially by God, and they got to experience the presence of God. So think of Moses. Moses is chosen by God. He's God's chosen instrument to rescue and redeem, deliver his people, and he's terrified after God chooses him, in large part because he says he's terrible with words. Can any of you relate with that? God wants me to be his mouthpiece. I can't even, I fumble all my words. I never know what I'm saying. I get all kinds of anxiety when I'm standing one-on-one with somebody and talk. Anybody relate with that? Listen to what God promises Moses in Exodus 3 and Exodus 4. He chooses Moses. Moses complains, but Moses said to God, Exodus 3.11, who am I that I should go to Pharaoh? I'm gonna go before the king and bring the children of Israel out of Egypt? But God said, I will be with you. Exodus 4, but Moses, he's still not done yet. He still hasn't given up his argument. But Moses said to the Lord, oh my Lord, I am not eloquent, either in the past or since you have spoken to your servant. It's not helping. God speaks therapy. Still not helping me. I'm still slow of speech and of tongue. Then the Lord said to him, who has made man's mouth? Is it not I, the Lord? Now therefore go. I will be your mouth. Joshua, after Moses is gone and dead, Joshua is chosen by God to succeed Moses and it was his task to conquer the promised land and to rid the promised land of all those great gigantic enemies of the people of God. Listen to Joshua 1 verse 5, God's promise to Joshua, just as I was with Moses. Joshua, so I will be with you. I will not leave you or forsake you either. Be strong and courageous, Joshua, for you shall cause this people to inherit the land that I swore to their fathers to give them. Why? What's your hope? I will be with you. Gideon, remember Gideon, one of those judges in the book of Judges. He's chosen by God to free Israel from the oppression of the big bad Midianites and Gideon was terrified, just like Moses, just like Joshua. In Judges 6 verse 15 we read this, and Gideon said to God, he's gonna plead his case, please Lord, how can I save Israel? Behold, my clan is the weakest in Manasseh and I am the least in my father's house. I'm a nobody, God, I'm the last person you should pick. But the Lord said to him, I will be with you. One more, Jeremiah, the great prophet Jeremiah, he was called by God to be his mouthpiece, to be a prophet speaking on behalf of the Lord, and he was called to do that as a young man. Imagine you young men, young women in the world, teenagers, imagine God coming to you and saying, hey, you're gonna speak to all the nations, you're gonna speak to all the churches and tell them what I really think, what would you think about that? Here's what Jeremiah thought about it, Jeremiah chapter 1, here's what Jeremiah says, then I said, ah Lord God, behold, I don't even know how to speak, I'm only a youth. God said back to him, verse 8, don't be afraid of them, for I am with you to deliver you, declares the Lord. You see, it's the same story over and over and over again, all the great men and all the great women of God who conquered kings, who rebuked a wayward people, who saved and rescued Israel, they all did it, why? Because they, of all the people in the world, they were chosen by God and filled with his presence. He was with them, oh, to experience what they experienced, to feel what they felt when God was with them, to speak with God face to face like Abraham spoke with God face to face, to sing and laugh like David did as I began the sermon. Where could I go, oh God, and you're not there? What would you give? To hear his voice like that, to feel his presence surrounding you and comforting you and protecting you, to know, to feel in your bones God is with you. The end of salvation, hear me carefully on this, the end of salvation, the final goal is not the forgiveness of your sins. Now hang on, stay with me carefully on this, you must be forgiven of your sins, I must be forgiven of my sins, every single one of our sins must be paid for and paid for it entirely or you will spend, the Bible is clear, all of eternity suffering under the wrath of God, the just wrath of God, for all of your sins in a real literal place called hell. You, I must be forgiven of our sins, but that's not the end of salvation, the forgiveness of sins, that's not, that's not like, oh we made it home, that's, that's a means to another end, what's the end of salvation? The end of salvation is the presence of God, forever, fully, forever. If you're here this morning and you are one of those who's never known the presence of God, you know it, I don't think I've ever experienced God like, like the pastors up there talking about, like those people from of old have talked about. Listen to me, God offers himself and all of himself to you, forever. Emmanuel, I'm going to show you in just a moment, that's who Jesus is, God with you, God with us forever. Jesus died to pay the penalty for sins and to make a people pure and presentable to God. Jesus rose from the dead to conquer death and reopen a portal, a passageway to God. You, you can't, listen to me, you cannot clean yourself up and make your way back to God, that is not how you're, you'll experience his presence. You can't do all the right things, you can't know all the right things and memorize all the right Bible verses, good works, education, even Bible education will not make you right before God, will not give you what you so long for in the presence of God, only one thing will. Jesus and his righteousness, which he provides for you, that which you could never drum up on your own. You must, I must, we all must, if you don't yet know the presence of God, you must turn from your sins and bow before Jesus, the king of kings, who claims all authority in heaven and on earth. All authority in heaven and on earth, that's what faith is. Yes, I give you my life as the king, is that you, that's how you find the presence of God. That's why you're here, that's why I'm here, that's, that's, that is the satisfaction every single one of our cravings and longings is searching for, the presence of God, where there's fullness of joy forevermore. Turn from your sins and trust in Jesus and you'll find an eternal presence. Matthew's gospel begins like a scene in a movie with a random little girl, a virgin called Mary, who is pregnant and her fiancé is about to quietly break up with her because he assumes she's cheated on him. Then while he's sleeping, he, the fiancé, Joseph, has a dream and in the dream an animal and in the dream an angel, it's also wild, the, an angel of God comes to him and tells him that this is all the work of the Holy Spirit, so don't leave her, she will bear a son, and you are to call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins. And then the angel in this dream to Joseph betrothed to Mary, this virgin girl named Mary, the angel quotes Isaiah 7 to explain what all this means. Here's what all this means, Joseph, here's what all this means, Trinity Church of Loudon, behold the virgin shall conceive and bear a son and you shall call his name Emmanuel, which means God with us. That's how Matthew begins his gospel, with a birth announcement of a baby who is coming and his name shall be God with us, Emmanuel. Matthew's gospel ends, the final scene in the movie, the baby is now all grown up, he suffered and died to save a people from their sins, he's risen from the dead and now claimed all authority in heaven and on earth, he's the king, he's the king of kings, and before he parts to ascend his heavenly throne forever, he parts with this promise, behold, I will be with you always, even to the end of the age. Do you see it? Do you see what Matthew, one scholar said that the focal point of Matthew's entire gospel is Emmanuel, God with us. Matthew's gospel begins with the announcement of Emmanuel, Matthew's gospel ends with Emmanuel parting and promising once again, Emmanuel, I will be with you always, to the end of the age, God with us forever, that's what the book's about, that's who Jesus is, he is God with us and he's God with us forever, which must mean, of course, that he's still with you today, if you know him by faith. Let me say that again because I'm afraid that when I say things like that, it's so familiar that we just lose the wonder, the shock of if Jesus is Emmanuel, that means if you know Jesus, God is in Jesus still with you today and fully with you today and will be with you forever. He's with you in the mundane, when your days all start to blend together and all start to feel the same. Some of you mothers in the room right now are at home right now for long hours taking care of kids, teaching and schooling kids, feeding kids, cleaning up after kids, putting out fights and fires with kids, mostly just trying to keep the kids alive. And if that's your world, days can all start to feel the same and it can feel really isolating and you can lose a clear sense of purpose in all of that work. What am I even doing here? Jesus is with you when you're doing the laundry, when you're making meals, when you're grocery shopping, he's with you and he's especially with you when you do that and you do all those things all for the sake of those kids becoming disciples, those kids knowing Jesus. He's with you when you're working and you don't really love your work and when your work is hard and when it's not that obvious that your work, especially compared to other people's work, really matters that much. He's with you. He's with you when you're lonely, when you're abandoned. He's with you at life's lowest moments and at life's end. This is Paul's testimony, one of the passages of scripture that has struck me as much as any other throughout my time of teaching the Bible. Paul, at the end of his life, his last letter, 2 Timothy chapter 4, he's signing off and he says this, 2 Timothy 4 verse 16, at my first defense, no one, he's in prison, at my first defense, no one came to stand by me, but all deserted me. May it not be charged against them. May it not be charged against them. What fools would forsake Paul? And yet here he is, the Lord's man, the Lord's chosen instrument. Here he is all alone in a prison cell, betrayed by his companions. He's all alone. And then he says this in verse 17, but the Lord stood by me. Lord in the New Testament always, unless otherwise noted, refers to the Lord Jesus, the King of Kings, all authority, heaven and earth. But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. And so I was rescued from the lion's mouth. The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed and bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever and ever. Amen. Don't you think that's true for you too? Those of you who are widows with us, you are, I know we're not pastors, church members, supposed to have favorites in the church, but you are our most treasured possession. Jesus is with you. Some of you have felt the sting of abandonment by a friend, by a spouse. Jesus is with you. He's with you when you repent, when you and I turn from our sins and seek his forgiveness. Some of you here this morning are followers of Jesus and you know you have not experienced the presence of God in a long time and it might just be because of sin. Sin does remove the experience, the experiential reality of the presence of God. So listen, you're not going to know his presence. You're not going to feel his closeness if you're walking in disobedience. If you're just repeatedly mistreating your spouse or looking at pornography or never spending any time pursuing the Lord in word or in prayer or walking, living a life of unforgiveness, refusing to forgive those around you or living in a lie or hiding unconfessed sin or withholding love or refusing to give yourself to your fellow church members, you're not going to know and experience his presence if that's you or me. Sometimes God withdraws his presence and discipline to warn us of the danger of our sins. Heed the warning. We all must repent and repent often. What if your repentance was the pathway to experiencing once again the fullness of God's presence that you so long for? He's with you and he's with us when we gather like this to worship him as the king. Earlier in Matthew's gospel, Jesus promised, whenever two or three are gathered in my name, there I will be with them. That means friends, he's with us now. He's with us every week in a special way when we gather to worship in word and in spirit. Jesus at the end of Matthew's gospel sends the disciples out and promises them that he will then be with them as well. That means he's with you and with us when we love the lost and risk comfort and reputation to speak up for Christ. He's especially, he's especially with us when we go forth in his name to speak on his behalf. When you're afraid but you go for it anyway, he's with you. When I shared the gospel just a moment ago, I believe he was with me and he helped me because he promises to do that. We're going to do an evangelistic outing in November and you're all invited by me but also by Jesus who has already signed up. He'll be with us. When you meet to disciple a younger Christian and wonder if you'll be able to help them at all because you still got on your own, all your own stuff you're working through, he's with you. Jesus is with his people and he's never more with his people. Matthew's gospel makes clear than when they're worshiping and when they're witnessing. That means God has chosen you like he chose Moses, like he chose Joshua. He's chosen you and promised to be with you and help you and comfort you forever. God has chosen you like he chose David and engulfed him with his presence. Where could you go? Where could I go? Where Jesus is not there. Nowhere. He's with us and he's with us, he says, until the end of the age. That means until he comes back once more, shows his power to all and makes all things new and dwells with us forever once again like in Eden. For that day we long but until that day he's with us. That's his promise forever. Let's pray. God, it almost feels too good to be true and for so many reasons, most of all our own sin and our own unbelief, we often don't feel it to be true and experientially know it to be true. And so God, we're pleading with you as a church family that you would come to us once more and show us all of yourself, your glory, your holiness, your saving power, your kindness, your love, your goodness. God, we want to know you like the apostle Paul prayed and cried out in Philippians 3. We want to know you and the power of your resurrection. God, we forsake all other things and even regard them as rubbish for the sake of the one thing of knowing Christ Jesus as Lord. So God, be with us. Come to us once more. God, show your power in saving those who do not yet know and have not yet trusted in Jesus for the first time. God, draw near to them now that they might know Emmanuel, God with us and God with them by faith in Christ. We pray all these things in Jesus name. Amen.
