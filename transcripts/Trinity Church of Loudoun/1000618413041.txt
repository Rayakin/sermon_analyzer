Jaws was released in 1975, just recently rewatched, still holds up incredibly well. So does Jurassic Park for that matter. Ever since Jaws was released, humans have been fascinated by the ocean's most feared predator in the great white shark and have made several attempts at capturing them and containing them in captivity for for live audiences. And so in 1955, I think, I didn't write the year down, but Google last night if memory serves me correct, the first attempt was made in 1955 at the now closed marine land of the Pacific. The shark captured and held in captivity died in its first day of being held. In 1981, fresh off the success of Jaws and Jaws 2 actually, but not yet Jaws 3D, which came out a few years later, SeaWorld gave it a shot for the first time. That shark lived for 16 days. And then several more attempts have been made since then with bigger tanks and more water and better technology, but always the same result. The sharks always seem to lose the will to live almost immediately upon being captured and stop eating. And they often injure themselves by repeatedly running into the glass walls. And after a few hours or a few days or most a few weeks, they always die. So scientists and researchers aren't exactly sure why, but they all agree and have concluded great whites cannot be held in captivity. There are certain creatures on this earth which just were not designed to be tamed or contained or held in captivity. Today we're going to begin a new six-week series on the doctrines of grace. So if you're new with us, I just pressed pause in the book of Genesis. We're at Genesis 25. Abraham has just died. We'll pick that up later this year. But we're going to begin a new six-week series beginning now on the doctrines of grace. We're going to explore more deeply from different places in the Bible, not just one book, how God's grace operates in saving us. Maybe you've never thought about that before. Maybe you're a Christian. You understand yourself to be a Christian. You are a Christian. You follow Jesus. But you've never thought about how grace came to you and what grace is doing in your life now and how you can depend on grace for the rest of your life even into eternity. That's what we're going to do over the next several weeks. Now because this is a new series and because we pretty rarely do this where we take a topic and just explore it for a few weeks. We normally just preach through books of the Bible, chapters, verses at a time. Because this is unusual, I want to take the opportunity just this morning at the outset of this series to tell you why we're doing this in the first place and also what I hope and what we hope to see happen. So I'm going to give you just quickly four brief reasons on why this series. Why a six-week series on the doctrines of grace. Reason number one, to lay a stronger doctrinal foundation in the life of our church. To lay a stronger doctrinal foundation in the life of our church. Our church, somebody reminded me yesterday, I sent it out to many of you, our church turned five yesterday. Totally forgot because we celebrate our, yeah, yeah, yeah, some of you are clapping but the rest of you aren't. We, we sell, I forgot because we celebrate in the fall but when we officially publicly launched as a church. But June the 24th, June the 24th of 2018, we took the Lord's Supper together for the first time and 39 of us covenanted together as a local church. And as a, as a still young church, our elders were recently discussing the importance of continuing to lay a really strong foundation of theology for the life of our church. Now obviously you get that, I get that, we get that from just preaching through the Bible. But sometimes it can be helpful to, for a season, for a time, to zoom out and pull the different parts of the Bible together and see how it all fits together. In other words, to do doctrine or theology together. And so number one, to lay a stronger doctrinal foundation in the life of our church. That's exactly what we're going to do here. We're going to zoom out and we're going to look at the Bible's teaching on one thing, namely grace. Saving grace. Second reason why this series. To gain a better understanding of our salvation. To gain a better understanding of our salvation. I want you in the coming couple of months to dig deeply and better understand how salvation works. Now for some of you, you might not yet be a Christian and this is an opportunity for you to very seriously consider the claims of Jesus and the offer of saving grace. Or again, many of you may have been following Jesus for a long time, but you've never stopped to think, well how does this actually, how was I actually saved? And how does this all work? Regardless of where you are, I hope the next several weeks offers us all an opportunity to dig more deeply. The next five sermons after this one will all concern the matter of salvation. Of grace in salvation. And so we're going to talk next week about the awful realities of our sinful condition. And then we're going to plumb the depths of God's grace for four straight weeks. How God's grace chooses, how it secures, how it conquers, and how it keeps you. I just told you the whole sermon series in one line, if you're writing or paying attention there. How it chooses, how it secures, how it conquers, and how it keeps. Again, many of you, some of you perhaps, are genuinely saved but have never really seriously considered the miracle of how that happened. We're going to consider that miracle over the coming several weeks. Number three, reason number three, to grow, as we just prayed, a bigger vision of God, which should give us a better vision of ourselves. To grow a bigger, larger vision of God, that is to see God as he truly is. He must increase, I must decrease, John the Baptist prayed. That's the prayer, that's the way of the Christian life. He must increase, I must decrease. And fourth, final reason why this series, before we even begin, for worship. For worship, the goal, and I hope the end for this little journey we're going to go on together, is for your and for my worship, for grace-fueled, joy-filled adoration of the God of all grace. In fact, that's where we begin this morning, with really the end of this series. I could have ended here, but I've decided to begin here. I'm going to begin this series with the end of it all in worship. So turn with me, if you have your Bible and you're not there already, to Romans chapter 11. That's towards the very back of your Bible. If you're new to the Bible, if you don't have a Bible, we have lots of copies in the back, right through those double doors. We'd love to give you a copy and encourage you to take it home and read it. So Romans chapter 11 will be in this morning. For this series, we'll be in Romans and John a lot, and other places as well. But let me just lay the table, just for a moment, with a little bit of context for Romans. Like most of Paul's letters, Romans has two basic parts. So it begins with gospel doctrine. So in Romans, in the first part of Romans, Paul reveals and unfolds the mysteries of the gospel before ending with the second part of gospel living. So Paul ends in part two by telling churches how to live in light of the mysteries he's just unfolded. How to get along. How to not destroy each other, given all of our differences and disagreements. So two parts to every letter, including Romans. Part one, gospel living. Part two, or part one, gospel doctrine. Part two, gospel living. Romans is exactly the same as all of Paul's letters in this way. Romans 1 through 9 is part one. It's doctrine. In fact, Romans 1 through 9 is Paul's fullest defense and explanation of the gospel. And then in chapters 12 through 16, the last part of the book, he turns to application and to life in the church. I say all that to show you our passage this morning, Romans 11, 33 through 36, is the bridge, or really the hinge, think like a door, between those two sections. Where Paul stops, as it were, to offer a doxology before he transitions. He stops to offer a word or a song of praise. Let me quote for you a couple people commenting on this transition in the middle of Paul's book, right after he's just plumbed all the depths and all the mysteries of God's salvation. Quote, one author says this, Paul, having caught a glimpse of the measureless majesty of God's mercy, here falls back in awe and wonder, which struggles to find expression. That's our passage this morning. One more quote. This is actually from the late John Stott. Paul's horizons in Romans are vast. He takes in, Romans 1 through 9, time and eternity, history and eschatology, or the future, justification, sanctification, glorification, and now he stops out of breath. An analysis, an argument, here give way and must give way to adoration. End quote. And so this morning, I'm going to kick off this series. We're going to kick off this series by looking at Paul's doxology here in Romans 11. And there are three big truths I want you to see. And I'm going to show you from these four verses. Number one, God is inexhaustible. God is inexhaustible. Number two, God has no rivals. God has no rivals. And number three, our conclusion, and really Paul's conclusion to this doxology, therefore God deserves all the glory. God is inexhaustible. I haven't even preached it yet. You're already amending. That's how awesome this passage is. God is inexhaustible. God has no rivals and therefore God deserves all the glory. I'm going to begin this series with the end of this series because I want you to see where this is all going from the start. And six weeks from now we'll see if we've actually reached our destination of worship, of greater worship, of doxology. So number one, God is inexhaustible. Look at verse 33. Oh the depth, Paul begins this doxology, oh the depth of the riches and the wisdom and the knowledge of God. How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways. God is inexhaustible. Oh the depth of the riches of the wisdom and the knowledge of God. How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable are his ways. Let me tell you a quick story and really it's the story of the of the nations, of all the nations, Jews and Gentiles from Romans 1 through 9. So I'm going to just here briefly summarize for you what Paul just said before he got to this point, out of breath as John Stott says. I want to summarize for you, retell you the story in one, two, three, four, five quick parts of the rest of Romans as it, here's the story of the nations from Paul in Romans. Part one, all the nations, that is all the Gentiles, the non-Jewish people, are dead in their sins. That's Romans chapter one. All the Gentiles are dead in their sins. They've rejected the creator. They've worshipped the creation and created things, chiefly themselves, ourselves. They've exchanged, Paul says, natural relations for unnatural relations, all because they refuse to bow before God, their creator. Now they worship, Paul says in chapter one, because we all worship, because we were made to worship, but their worship is broken. They worship the wrong things, like a hungry toddler who you take your eyes off for just a few minutes and you come back and you find them in the kitchen, mouth colored purple and drool coming down everywhere, not with grapes but with crayons. They're halfway through the packet. We worship, but our worship is broken. The nations are dead in their sins. But, part two, story of the nations, but surprise, so is Israel. So are the people of God dead in their sins. That's Romans chapter two. And you just have to imagine the shocking twist of the knife that that was, as Paul wrote to his fellow countrymen, the Israelites. So are the Israelites dead in their sins? You see, Israel, Paul says, looked to the law, looked to all the commandments, the ten commandments and all the commandments of the Old Testament, but didn't realize that the law was looking back at them and condemning them, like a mirror showing your blemishes, because they broke the commandments, they broke the law. And so, Paul says, Israel too, the people of God, are no better off. None is righteous. No, not one, Romans 3 10 says. That means no Jew or Gentile. The world is filled with sinners. All deserve punishment from the just God, is Paul's conclusion in Romans 1 and chapter 2. But, part three, five part story, really quickly, Romans 1 through 9, I'm summarizing it for you, but there's good news in Romans. Romans is a book of good news. Here's the good news. God sent one man. That man came from Israel, and that man came to represent all men, all men and all women. That's Jesus. He's the point of this book of Romans. He's the point of every book in the entire Bible. Jesus was sent by God as a representative, as a substitute, and in our place, as our representative, he died. After, in our place, he lived as our representative, and he lived righteously, and then he dies on a cross. And in our place, upon that cross, he died receiving the full punishment that all of our sins, not his, he had no sins. He received the full punishment, the fullness of the wrath of God stored up from all of history for our sins upon his back. And by his death, Paul says, this is chapter 3 of Romans, by his death, God has now punished sins, because God is just. But even more than that, God has now justified sinners, because God is also good and merciful. Now, fourth part of the story of the nations in the book of Romans, now it doesn't matter, Paul says, therefore, it doesn't matter where you come from. It doesn't matter if you're Jew or Gentile or black or white. It doesn't matter where you come from. All are justified by God in the same way. How is that same way? What's the one way to be justified before God? Jesus. By faith in Jesus. This is chapter 4. Faith like who had? Genesis. Abraham had. Faith like Abraham justifies everybody. Gentile nations, the pagan nations, can now be saved before God, can inherit all the riches of heaven just by believing like Abraham. And it's the same for the Jews. This is Romans 4 through 8. By faith, we're new in Christ. We're raised in Christ to new life, and we're joined together to the new people of God, the new family of God, which God is creating in Jesus, the church. Jew and Gentile. So four parts of the story of the nations in the book of Romans. But here's where things get wild and crazy in Romans. What about, what about God's people, the Jews? What about all God's promises to them? We've been in Genesis. You've seen all those promises God made to Abraham and his offspring. What about those promises? They're just gone? They just failed? Well, Paul answers that question in Romans 9 through 11. And here's his answer. First of all, not all Israel is lost or dead in their sins. It's not as though all the Jews are dead and destined for God's eternal punishment. Many Jews, after all, believed in Jesus. Like who? Like Paul, the author of the letter. And believing in Jesus, they too are justified. So not all Israel is lost. But second of all, his second answer, and this is indeed where things get really wild. And if you know Romans 9 through 11, you could see the pun there, because it's a wild olive branch being grafted into the olive tree. Things get really wild and crazy. As Paul says, all those Jews, those other Jews who have rejected Jesus, their rejection—I'm summarizing a lot of verses here—their rejection has made room at the table for the Gentiles. Like, I assume, you and me, or the dominant majority of us. We're at the table before God, before the King, because of their rejection. And in some future day—Paul doesn't say exactly when or exactly how—but in some future day, when the fullness of the Gentiles have now come in, and when God has filled his churches from every tribe, tongue, and nation, then, Paul says, God is going to do another fresh work upon Israel, upon his original covenant people, and draw her back into Jesus, and back into the church once again. That's Romans 9 through 11. That's the wild and crazy story of the nations from Romans 1 through 11. You got it? That's the story of God's saving work among all the nations, still unfolding today, as told from Romans 1 through 11. And now, in chapter 11, Paul is about to transition from gospel doctrine, from all that doctrine of exposing these mysteries to gospel living and application. But before he does, he stops, and in awe and wonder of what he just said, he explodes in song. Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his ways! How inscrutable his judgments! Can you believe it, Paul says? Can you believe Caiaphas, his rejection of Jesus, was for your salvation? Can you believe it? And God's still not done. With the nations, or even with Israel, the olive tree of the saved is ever growing larger. Who could have ever imagined what God was up to? Who could have ever guessed that it would turn out this way? Who could have ever looked at everything that was happening in history, in the book of Acts, or in our own lives, and had any idea what God was up to? Who could have known that God could be this wise, and this good, and that salvation might come to so many, both Jew and Gentile, that you and I would be here today, with plenty of room still at the table, seated before the King? Oh, the depth of the riches! Riches is a favorite idea of Paul in Romans. In chapter 2, verse 4, Paul speaks of the riches of God's kindness, and forbearance, and patience. He's so rich in kindness. Aren't you glad for that? He's so rich in patience with you and me. In 9.23, Paul speaks of the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy. There are vessels of wrath, Paul says, and there are vessels of mercy. That is, people designed for the purpose of their lives, their existence, for all eternity. All those now saved in Jesus is to be shown, and be floored, and be showered in God's mercy. And God is rich in glory for his vessels of mercy. Chapter 10, verse 12, Paul speaks of the riches of God's salvation, which he's now freely bestowing on all who call upon him, both Jew and Gentile. Riches. God is very rich in Romans, and here in the doxology, Paul connects riches with God's wisdom and knowledge. The riches of his wisdom and knowledge. How rich, Paul says, the wisdom and knowledge of God. When was the last time you just paused, and pondered, and laughed, or cried, or wondered at the absurd deep wisdom and knowledge of God unfolded for us in the Bible? Job and his friends thought they had. Thought they had discovered wisdom and knowledge. Do you remember Job and all of his friends, all of his counselors? And so they talked, and they talked, and they pontificated, and they covered all their bases for why God had done all the awful things that he'd done in Job's life. And they said the sorts of things that you and I would would say, and then pat ourselves on the back, and watch all of our friends shake their heads at us, and say, well, that guy's really wise. And then God broke his silence amongst Job and his friends in chapter 38, verse 1. Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind, out of the hurricane, and said, who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge, dressed for action like a man? I will question you, Job, and you make it known to me. Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell me if you have understanding. Who determined the earth's measurements? Surely you know. Or who stretched the line upon it? On what were its bases sunk? Or who laid its cornerstone? When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy. Where were you? Or who shut the sea in with doors when it burst out from the womb? When I made clouds its garments, and thick darkness its swaddling band, and prescribed limits and boundaries for the seas, and set bars and doors, and said, thus far you shall come, ocean, and no further, and here shall your proud waves be stayed. Have you commanded the morning since your days began, Job, and caused the dawn to know its place, that it might take hold of the skirts of the earth, and the wicked be shaken out of it? Do you know? Have you seen? What do you and I know? What have we seen? What wisdom or knowledge do we have? Fools, all of us, before God Almighty. I can't remember what I had for breakfast, or any of my children's names when I'm angry at them. I got fine grades in school, and now I have no clue how to assist my daughter with her fifth grade math. God measured the galaxies, conducted the orchestras of the angels as He created. God tames the oceans, and now He rules the church, and He guides the church, and He keeps the church until the end in glory. Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God. God is inexhaustible. You can search all you want. You can go on a deep sea dive into the depth of God's riches. You'll never find the bottom. I'm trying to make this first point not by just using cool logic. You know, God cannot be exhausted because God is God, and that means He's big, and He has a big mind, and therefore that cannot be exhausted. That entirely misses the mark that Paul is making here. Paul is worshiping the inexhaustible God whose wisdom and knowledge have no bottom or no end. Whose judgments, he says, that's all that he thinks and all that he decides. His judgments are unsearchable. They're mysterious to us unless He reveals them to us. Whose ways, that's all He does, and wherever He goes. Whose ways are inscrutable. He's not a riddle that can be solved by any mortal. Paul saw more in Romans 1 through 9. That's why I showed you that story. Paul saw more and showed more, revealed more than anybody before or anybody since. Any mathematician, any theologian, any biblical writer, Paul saw more and showed more of the mysteries of God. Romans here is probably the most important letter ever written. Romans 9 through 11 was truly groundbreaking. And after his pen unfolded all those deep mysteries, then and there, after going that deep, he stops and he cries out, oh God, I cannot find the bottom. Oh God, the unsearchable depths of your riches and knowledge and ways and judgments. Weigh the riches of Christ in scales. This is Spurgeon. Weigh the riches of Christ in scales and weigh His treasure in your balances. And then try to count the treasures which belong to the saints. Reach the bottom of Christ's sea of joy if you can. And then hope to understand the bliss which God hath prepared for them that love Him. Cross the boundaries of Christ's possessions and then dream of a limit to the inheritance of the elect. All things are yours for ye are Christ and Christ is God's. Oh the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God. God is inexhaustible. Secondly, God has no rivals. Here we're going to look at verses 34 and 35. God has no rivals. There's a story in Greek mythology of Echo and Narcissus. Any of you know the story of Echo? I know if the PhD kids were here, they're not here. A few of you are here. Y'all probably know the story of Echo and Narcissus. Echo is a mountain goddess with a beautiful voice, singing voice, talking voice. But she's cursed by another goddess such that she's only able to use her beautiful voice to finish the end of others' spoken sentences. So Echo, she can only echo. Narcissus is a really handsome young man of the woods who Echo sees and falls in love with. And so Echo in the story, the tale, pursues Narcissus all her life. But it's never meant to be and they never really fall in love. Why? Because Narcissus has fallen in love already with somebody else, his own reflection, which he saw in a pool of water and confused for somebody else. Really beautiful. And so the story ends with Narcissus wasting away and then dying while staring at the love of his life, not realizing that the love of his life is his own reflection. Narcissus fell in love with himself and so was doomed to never find love outside of himself or his own reflection. In verses 34 and 35 of our passage, Paul asks, look at your Bibles, two questions and each question is borrowed. You'll see that's why they're written in quotation marks. The first in verse 34 is borrowed from Isaiah and the second in verse 35 is borrowed from Job. Verse 34, first question, for who has known the mind of the Lord or who has been his counselor? This is from Isaiah 40. And Isaiah 40's awesome vision of God, the shepherd king who comes to save his people. And here's what Isaiah 40 verse 12 says. You'll see where Paul got the quote from. Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and marked off the heavens with a span? Who has enclosed the dust of the earth in a measure and weighed the mountains and scales and the hills in a balance? You hear how much that sounds like God at the end of Job? Who has measured the spirit of the Lord or what man shows him counsel? What man shows God counsel, Isaiah says. Think about that. Adults, kids, we still need counselors. Pastors need counselors. That's why God's word prescribes, among other things, a plurality. And every church is a plurality of elders, not just one pastor, pastors. Spirit-filled Christians still need counsel. Presidents need cabinets. But for God, there's no one. To whom would God turn for counsel? He sees all, discerns all, discerns beginning from end, top from bottom. He sees everything. He knows everything. To whom would he turn? Verse 35, second question. Or who has given a gift to God that he might be repaid? This is from Job 41. God, again, this is that same passage where Job is being addressed by God from the whirlwind after Job has just questioned God and God's justice. How could you do this to me, God? Where was God? Where were you in all my sufferings? Then God spoke from the whirlwind and Job immediately realized he crossed a line. Can you draw out, God says, can you draw out Leviathan, a great beast of the ocean, with a fish hook or press down his tongue with a cord? Can you put a rope in Leviathan's nose or pierce his jaw with a hook? I can, is the implication. Behold, the hope of a man is false. He is laid low even at the sight of Leviathan. You're scared to death if you just see a fin above the water. No one is so fierce that he dares to stir up Leviathan. Who then is he who can stand before me, God says? Who has first given to me, here's where Paul quotes, that I should repay him? Whatever is under the whole heaven is mine. God owes me nothing. God owes me nothing. Not life, not breath, not answers, not even mercy or anything. God is no man's debtor. In fact, it's even worse than that. If God owes us anything, it's justice for our sins against him. It's only when you get that and I get that and how big and how holy God is and how distant we are from him that we'll see the mercies of God and the cross of Jesus for the explosive wonder that it is. The biggest obstacle to you and me seeing and encountering God for all of his explosive glory as revealed in the Bible and for finding delight in that and seeing that as a good thing, how big God is, is those self-enlarged lenses you and I were born with, which sees ourselves in the pool or in the mirror, if you like, and judges ourselves to be far bigger and far more important and far more worthy than we actually are. There's a narcissist in all of us. It's our human condition. We all got it from Adam. We're all born with a worldview. Think about it like this. A lot of talk of worldview. A lot of you kids or teenagers or college students talk about or study worldview. We're all born with a worldview. You don't just get one. You don't even just get it from your parents. All of us. I don't care if our parents are Christians or Muslims or Hindus or vegetarians or whatever your parents are. All of us are born with the same basic worldview. With us at the center. Man at the center. A man-centered worldview. Let me show you just a little what this looks like and what this sounds like. Let me show you what a—it's a very familiar thing. It's innate to all of us. Let me show you some signs and symptoms. I'll give you four of a man-centered worldview. Let me tell you what it sounds like. Let me tell you what it looks like just for a moment. Number one, it sounds like this. Well, God cannot be blank. What would you fill that blank in with? If you would fill that blank in, well, God cannot do this or God cannot be this. If you fill that blank in with anything other than what was expressly revealed by God himself in his word, why can't he be? Says who? Says me? Says you? King of the universe, you and me? God is God and bound by no rules, no laws other than himself. Number two, it looks like a God—and I wish you could see in my notes, I have this G lowercase here—it looks like a God, your God, who thinks and looks and acts, what do you know, just like you. He agrees with all your opinions. What a great God. He agrees with everything I already thought. You and I, friends, were created in the image of God, not the other way around. Number three, now let me pick on the church and pick on the preacher, pick on myself. It sounds like, a man-centered worldview, it sounds like sermons which have basically become how-to guides. Sermons which are aimed at nothing higher, no higher level than right here, you, and how to be a better you, and how to be a better husband, and how to be a better wife, and how to be a better parent, and how to be a better worker, your job, and how to be better with your finances, and how to have better self-esteem, and how to have a better life. So God basically becomes, in this sort of church, in this sort of preaching, God becomes our life coach. And the Bible becomes, it's viewed as a manual for your and my self-improvement. What a tragedy. What a tragedy to think of God as that small, like going to a major league baseball game, and all the superstars are not on the field, and they invite the fans to come out and play catch. You came here for this? What a tragedy. God is God. God is bound by no one. Number four, one more, just quickly, man-centered worldview. I think it thinks like this. This is one of the ways it thinks, a symptom of a man-centered worldview. It thinks that heaven will be boring. Now, I know all of us thought that when we were eight years old, or have thought that before, but think about why that works, and why we think that way. Why will heaven be boring in our minds? Because heaven is a world of worship. Because heaven is a play, if you will, that already has a lead actor. And what could possibly be more boring, so we all said when we were eight years old, and started doing the math of eternity in our minds, what could possibly be more boring than eight trillion years of singing with angels to God? Brothers and sisters, we're all born with this. Does this sound familiar? This is an eight to all of us. Again, we got it all, this worldview from Adam. What Paul is showing us here in this doxology is a new worldview, if you will, with God at the center, really with God restored to his throne. And so let me ask you before we move on, how's your worldview? God has no rivals, no angel, not even Satan, not a rival to God, an enemy of God, not a rival to God, certainly not you or me. He needs nothing from us. He owes us nothing ever. He stands utterly alone, without rival and without equal. And I'm starting this series here by trying to get God way up here in our minds and in our hearts, because if we don't have this clear, the bigness of God, then we're never going to be prepared for the explosive things that the Bible has to say about salvation, about grace, frankly, about anything. What we'll do instead, if God is down here, you know, with a slightly bigger, better version of us, we'll stand as judges over what God's Word says. Well, this can't mean that. Why? Because I can't accept that. Because I know better than, no, God is God, without any rivals or equals. Seeing that and seeing the big God that is the God who is, is the beginning of seeing, and the beginning of living. Which is where Paul finishes, and we'll finish this morning. Thirdly, God deserves all the glory. Paul's conclusion to this song, and really to this majestic first part of Romans, God deserves all the glory. Look at verse 36. The doxology of Romans 11, which is the hinge of this entire book, is spontaneous worship at the inexhaustible and unrivaled God, as we just saw. And it comes to a conclusion in verse 36, as Paul concludes by calling everyone, and really everything, to give glory to God. Why? Because all things are from Him. Paul begins with God as the source, the origin of all things. All things are from God. Creation comes entirely from Him. Salvation comes entirely from Him, as we're going to consider in the next five weeks. Every good and perfect gift in your life, all comes from Him. Heaven comes from God. He is heaven. All things from Him. He's the source. Why else? Why else all things should give glory to God? Because all things are through Him. All things are through Him. God is the sustainer. He's the sustainer, Paul is saying. The world right now is spinning on its 24-hour axis by and through the sustaining power of God. You, right now, every single one of you, I hope and pray to God, are breathing in oxygen, which is feeding your blood, which is causing your heart to pump, which is keeping you alive, something like that. I googled this to make sure. I don't know science that well. All by the power of God. Science can discover it and locate it. Science is not causing that. God is doing that. He's a sustainer. If He stops sustaining right now, if He pulls back right now, you're done. I'm done. The church is alive and fed and strengthened, even right now in this very moment, through the power of the Holy Spirit and by the Word of God. All things are through Him. God sustains all things. Why else? One more. Why else should all things give all glory to God? Because lastly, Paul says, all things are to Him. God is the source. God is the sustainer. God is also the goal. He's, all things exist for the goal, for the purpose of His glory. All things are to Him. Trees sway for God's glory. Great white sharks swim and eat somehow for God's glory. They actually tracked a great white shark that swam the entire length of the Atlantic Ocean. Are you kidding me? Swam it for God's glory. All those deep sea, still to be discovered and hideous creatures are there for some reason for God's glory. Undiscovered galaxies exist for God's glory. Jews exist for God's glory. Gentiles exist for God's glory. Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Psalm 150 ends. Everything exists for the goal and the purpose of the glory of God, even you, especially you. Who can stand before this inexhaustible, unrivaled God to whom belongs all glory? Is there anyone worthy? Only one other person in all the Bible, in all of creation, even in all of heaven, is ever described in the same exalted way. Colossians 1, He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. For by Him, by Jesus, Jesus, all things were created in heaven and on earth, invisible and invisible, and whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities, all things were created through Him and for Him. And He is before all things. You see what Paul's saying? He's saying here of Jesus, what he says elsewhere, of the glorious God. Jesus is the source. Jesus is the sustainer. Jesus is the goal of all things. All things were created through Him and for Him, and He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together in Jesus. If Jesus stops doing whatever He's doing, reigning in heaven right now at the right hand of God, you also stop breathing. And He is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything, everything, He might be preeminent. There are creatures in this world that just cannot be tamed, cannot be contained, and should not, cannot be held in captivity. How much more so is that true of the God of glory? Listen to this testimony. I'll never forget the first time I read this as a college student. This is from Acts 17. You want to talk about something that just explodes your worldview. Acts 17, 24 and 25. The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by man. Now watch this. Nor is He served by human hands, as though He needed anything, since He Himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything, as though He needed anything. He needs nothing. God has never once looked at you or me and thought, I could really benefit from that. I could really use what he or she has if they give it to me. God is utterly free in that way, free of need, free of lack. And I want to ask you, it's worth asking it, what I'm saying right now, is this offensive to you? Please don't answer out loud. We can talk about it after the service. Is this offensive to you? And I want to suggest that offense, if you feel it a little or a lot right now, God does not need anything from you. That offense is the proper and the only beginning in our hearts, as God designed it, as we brush up against His vastness. I'd certainly say on a personal note that when I first heard of the sovereignty of God and first encountered passages like this of the utter freedom of God, of the total power of God, it was deeply offensive to me. And I want to say it needed to be, it had to be, because I had a really high view of myself and consequently a really low view of God. I needed to be, I needed to be offended. I needed God in my heart and my mind to ascend His throne. There's a surprising freedom in discovering our smallness before the glorious God. Nobody stands before the vastness of the ocean and puffs their chest out. Nobody looks up at the blackness of the endless skies with all the sparkling stars on a clear night and feels larger. And in those moments, you've all felt it. Would you want to feel bigger? Would you want to feel bigger? Behold the God of glory and the Lord of glory, the Lord Jesus Christ. Feel your smallness before Him and embrace it. After all, God loves the small things, sparrows and lilies He cares for. How much more so you, the pinnacle, the image bearer of His creation. God loves weak people and all who trust not in themselves but who look to Christ as the glorious one. He keeps them and secures them all by His power and all, as we're going to consider for the next five weeks, by His grace. Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God. How unsearchable are His judgments and how inscrutable are His ways. For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been His counselor? Or who has given to Him a gift that He might be repaid? For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be glory forever. Amen. Amen. Let's pray. God, as we consider Your vastness, Your grandeur, Your holiness, what is man that You are mindful of Him, the Son of Man that You take regard for Him? Who are we, O God, but dust of the earth, and yet in Christ You know us by name and You love us and You've saved us after coming to us and living for us and dying for us and being raised victorious over our enemies, sin and death. And so, God, we pray that You would help us to find our rest in You, even in Your bigness. God, we pray that You would reveal more of Yourself to us and in doing so, we pray You would help us to better understand ourselves and our lives and live them for Your glory. We pray all these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
