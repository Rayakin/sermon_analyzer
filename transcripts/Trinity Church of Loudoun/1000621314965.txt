Long ago, in a galaxy far, far away. I'm not a big Star Wars guy, but I know that when those words come on the screen at the beginning with the theme song, you actually have to read them, because if you don't read them, you're gonna be utterly lost in whatever battle is happening on whatever planet or moon, because those words provide the backstory to the movie that you're about to watch. It all began with the forging of the great rings. Three of them were given to the elves, immortal, wisest, and fairest of them all. Seven to the dwarf lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine rings were given to the race of men who, above all else, desire power. Right now, I'm rereading The Fellowship of the Rings. It's a book based on a movie that came out my senior year of high school. I also recently reread The Hobbit, which takes place 60 years before The Fellowship. It explains how the ring was rediscovered and how the ring came to rest in the Shire of all places. I'm also watching right now The Rings of Power. What a gloriously dweeby summer this is turning out to be. I'm watching The Rings of Power, which is set some thousand years before The Hobbit. It explains even more of the backstory and how Middle-earth came to be Middle-earth as we all know it. We are living, one writer recently said, we are living in the age of the prequel, the sequel, and of the reboot. Now, I don't know, I don't know what that, I don't know if that means originality is dead. I don't know what that means that we're living in that age, but I personally think it's awesome to watch Hollywood continually reboot your childhood, at least for me. And how wonderful to see the, for all of us, to see the background, the backstory to your favorite superhero kids, or whoever it is. This morning, we're going to be all over the Bible, and not just in one passage like normal. If you're new here, if this is your first time, we don't, I don't usually preach like this. We're usually just working through a book of the Bible. That's not an apology, because I do think this has a place in the church, but it's sort of an apology. And if you know anything about interpersonal relationships and conflicts, half apologies are no apologies at all. So it's a pointless apology. This morning, we're going to tackle, from all over the Bible, the doctrine of election. Now, yeah, election is a triggering word for many, and it's often a fighting word in the church. Some of you, I bet, have been on edge from the moment you saw my sermon title in the bulletin. What's a preacher going to say about this? So why preach on it? Why take a side in something that's so controversial? Why poke a hibernating bear? Things are honestly pretty good right now in the life of our church. Not any big fights or divisions that I'm aware of. Why risk offending some with a controversial topic in the Bible? Two quick reasons. I could probably give you 10 or more, but two quick reasons why we're tackling this big, huge, yes, controversial doctrine of election this morning. Reason number one, it is in the Bible. And that's what we do. That's my job. That's why you pay me and us, some of us, to preach God's Word to you and not just our ideas. How cowardly to skip over parts of the Bible that are in the Bible just because it makes some people uneasy or causes disagreements. It's in the Bible. Second reason, even more, and I really want you to see this this morning and next week because I'm breaking this into two, decided that late last night. In the Bible, election is offered as a word of comfort. I want you to think about that. It's offered consistently as a word, as a teaching to help you, to encourage you through life's storms and through your own internal doubts about God's love for you and through your temptations and my temptations to sin. Our own statement of faith, which we didn't write, we've redrafted as our own from a bunch of Baptists in New Hampshire in the 1850s. It has an article in it on election. I'm not going to read for you the entire article, but one of the lines in there is it says this, election is the foundation of Christian assurance. You might have questions about, you might even be predisposed to not like a teaching like election, but don't you want to be assured? Don't you want to know that God loves you and that your eternity is secure in him? Those Baptists, almost 200 years ago, saw election as fundamentally attached to your and my security and assurance in our salvation. So it may be a word that makes us uneasy. It may be a word that could cause an argument or ten in the church, in our church, but the Bible most often uses the same word and teaching to comfort suffering Christians, to aid persecuted churches, and to remind them that they're okay and that they're going to be okay. And that really makes me want to figure out what they meant, the Bible authors, and what they saw and to figure that out and to preach it to you and to preach it to myself. So for a little context, in this series so far on grace, at least I've said it's about grace, but so far two installments I've shown you two things. Number one, God is way bigger than you ever could possibly imagine. God is way bigger than you ever imagined. So he cannot be contained. He cannot be forced to conform to our thoughts or our assumptions or our ideas. We have no rights to question him. He certainly has no obligation to answer us or any of our questions. God is way bigger than any of you ever, any of us ever possibly imagined. He stands alone in a category all on his own. Second installment I showed you, you and I are way more sinful than you ever imagined. Dead in our trespasses and sins, Paul says, wretches as John Newton, not Isaac Newton. I erroneously said last time and was corrected on. Gravity, John Newton, amazing grace. Today, alas, we do actually come to grace. And what I want to show you and I want us to see together is that grace, God's grace to you, Christian, began before time. If you're here this morning and you are a Christian, then the story of you becoming a Christian, whether you knew this or not, began before time. This morning we are going to look at the the prequel, the the backstory to your salvation and mine. That's what election is. It's the backstory to us encountering God's grace. And I'm going to break this one, as I said, into two sermons. Part one this morning. Right now I want to show you in the Bible this teaching on election. I want to, in a way, prove it to you from the Bible. And part two next Sunday, I want to show you how election is not only true, it's not only there in the Bible, but it is actually meant to help you as a Christian and even to shape our life together as a church. So that's what we'll do. That means this morning is going to be heavy on ideas or doctrine and next week is going to be much heavier on application. But this morning I want to show you two things. The story of election and the source of election. The story of election and the source of election. So let's begin by looking first at the story of election. Let's begin with the story of election in all the Bible. Because election is not one proof verse in the Bible, one single bullet in the chamber. It does not begin with Paul or Romans 9, that famous and controversial passage which we'll deal with in a few minutes. It's actually all over the place. It's an unfolding story. Election is in the Bible and really an unfolding drama. And the story begins way before Romans and Paul. And the story begins actually all the way back in Genesis. Election is the story of Abraham, who we've been studying as a church for the last six months as we've walked through Genesis together. Think about it. Let me remind you. Abraham grew up in Ur of the Chaldeans. That's what we know and later is known in the Bible as Babylon. And Abraham grew up in a pagan household that worshiped the moon and the stars. Meaning Abraham almost certainly sang songs as a boy and prayed to the moon man. Not a joke. And had no idea who God was until one day Abraham heard a voice. His name was Abram at the time. He heard a voice call out to him which he somehow knew to be God's voice. Until one day God came to Abraham and God called Abraham and God chose Abraham. Listen to the biblical writer Nehemiah much later reflecting on how this story of Israel and Abraham all began. Nehemiah 9 verse 7. You are the Lord, the God who chose Abraham. The God who chose Abraham and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans and gave him the name Abraham. This begs the question you ought to be wondering why Abraham? You know of all the Chaldeans of Ur, Abraham was not the only one. And God didn't choose any of them. Why did God choose Abraham? He didn't choose Abraham because he came from the right family. Abraham came from a pagan home in Babylon. He didn't choose Abraham because Abraham was searching for God. Abraham worshipped other gods, the wrong gods, not real gods. He didn't choose Abraham because he saw something in Abraham. That's how we often think. He must have seen something in Abraham that he, God, could work with. Abraham, think about the story of Abraham. As we go on to find out Abraham was a conniving coward who repeatedly pawned his wife off to foreigners to save his own hide. Who took his servant girl and impregnated her because he did not trust God. He didn't, God didn't see something in Abraham he could work with. Why did God chose choose Abraham? He chose Abraham because he chose him. He chose Abraham because he loved him. He chose Abraham because God is God and because God chooses who God chooses. Election is the story of Abraham. Election is the story of Israel. Most of us are familiar with a lot of our Bibles are about this random nation called Israel. A lot of us are familiar with that but I wonder if you've ever thought about how the story of Israel is the story like Abraham of election. So a nation comes from Abraham. The nation is called Israel and they become the people of God. And what that means is just like God talked to Abraham in a special way that he didn't talk to everybody else in the world. So God talked to and made promises to this one nation and not all the other nations. And he gave to this one nation his promises and his laws and his word and his protection. And he put his name upon them. Why? Listen to Deuteronomy 14 verse 2 and how Moses here speaks of and God speaks of this this people this nation. For you are a people holy to the Lord your God. That's not true of Babylon. That's not true of any other nation in the world at this point. That's only true of Israel. You are a people holy set apart to the Lord your God and the Lord has chosen you. The Lord has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession. Think about that phrase. Remember that phrase treasured possession. That's used a lot in the Bible of Israel. God has chosen you to be a treasured possession out of all the peoples out of all the nations who are on the face of the earth. And so God chose Israel and why Israel? Of all the nations of the world why Israel? There must have been something about Israel or their land or their potential or something that captured God's eyes right? Listen to Moses addressing Israel in Deuteronomy 7. We already heard parts of this earlier read for us by David. Deuteronomy 7 verses 6 through 8. For you are a people holy to the Lord your God. The Lord your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession. Same language. Out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth. So why them? Why them? Listen to God through Moses answer. It was not because you were more in number than any other people that the Lord set his love on you and chose you. For you were the fewest of all the peoples. How do we think about preference or selection or choice or why God? He has to see something in us. Just like I saw something in my wife and somehow she saw something in me. There has to be something there. So it's just natural for a nation, for a people, for a government, for a king, for a politician to think well look at our power. God would look at the nation with power. Moses says God says to Israel it was not because of your strength. You were the weakest. You were the puniest of all the nations out there. But it is because the Lord loves you and is keeping the oath that he swore to your fathers. That's why the Lord has brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. Why did God choose Israel? Because he loved her. Because he made promises to her. Listen to Deuteronomy chapter 9 verses 6 and 7. This is right before Israel finally, finally, finally inherits the promised land. After all the journeys and the getting stuck in the wilderness. They're on the cusp of the promised land. Listen to what God says here. Know therefore that the Lord your God is not giving you this good land to possess because of your righteousness. For you are a stubborn people. Can you imagine if I tried to flatter my wife with letters like this? I want you to know it's not because of you. You're actually really difficult to get along with. Don't try this one unmarried folks. My goodness. You are a stubborn people. Remember and do not forget how you provoke the Lord your God to wrath in the wilderness. From the day you came out of the land of Egypt until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against the Lord. Are you getting the picture? God chose Israel. And why did he choose her? He chose Israel because he chose her. He chose Israel because he, we don't know why, he loved her. He chose Israel because God is God and God chooses whom God chooses. Election is the story of Abraham. Election is the story of Israel. Now maybe for most of you in the room, for all of you in the room, so far so good. That's fine. I don't know Abraham. I'm not Jewish. One more. Election is the story of the church. Election is the story of the church. What about when we come to the New Testament and to the people of God? Like Israel, like Abraham, they repeatedly are called chosen or elect. Let me just give you a sampling. I could do this for probably an hour. Second Thessalonians 2 13. Paul writing to a church. But we ought always to give thanks to God for you brothers and sisters beloved by the Lord. Why should we always give thanks for you to God? Because God chose you. Romans 11 verse 5. So too at the present time there is a remnant. There's always been a remnant. Even in Israel, even when everybody else rebelled, there's always a remnant. Even now there is a remnant chosen, Paul says, by grace. Those aren't words we often associate together, do we? Chosen by grace. Chosen by grace. Election is grace. One more. 1 Peter 1 1 and 2. This is Peter beginning a letter written to churches, the people of God. Peter, he says, this is his signature at the beginning. Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who are elect exiles, elect exiles, chosen exiles of the dispersion. Verse 2 says, according to, how do they become the elect exiles? According to the foreknowledge, the foreknowledge of God the Father. Are you getting the, this is all through the New Testament spoken of the church. 1 Peter 2 9 and 10. Listen to the language Peter uses here of the church. Not of Israel, but of the church. But you are a chosen race. A chosen race. A royal priesthood. A holy nation. He's not talking about an actual nation people group like America or like Israel. He's talking about the church. You are a chosen race. A royal priesthood. A holy nation. A people for God's own possession. Remember that language? Treasured possession. That you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness and into his marvelous light. Once you were not a people, but now you are God's people. Once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy. Peter writes to the church, I want you to see, saying all the same things that God said of Israel so long ago. The church is now the people of God. The church now and forever is the treasured possession of God. Israel was the shadow. The church is now the fulfillment. The real final full thing. Meaning God has once again and forever attached himself to a people. And this time he's done it forever. And again, how did the church become God's people? How did we become God's people? How did you, if you're a Christian, how did you become God's person, son or daughter? There are lots of ways to answer that. We could talk about faith. That's certainly part of the Bible's answer to that. We could even talk about our own stories, our own testimonies. But the answer has to at least start before that and really way before that. God chose the church because he chose her. And because he loves her. And because God is God and God chooses whom he chooses. Why the church? Because God chose the church. And that's really what I want to show you the rest of our time this morning and even next week. The story of election. I hope you can see. I'm just giving you a glimpse. The story of election runs through the entire Bible. And it's now, if you're a Christian, collided with your life. There is no Bible or story of the Bible without election. And there is no people of God then Israel or now the church without God's sovereign choice, election. And if you think about it, whatever you're predisposed to think about election, doesn't that have to be true? Because if it depended upon anything in us, who could possibly be worthy? Election is the story of the Bible. The second thing I want to show you this morning, in addition to the story of election, the final thing I want to show you this morning is the source of election. The source of election. In other words, from where and really when does election originate? When is this happening? Where and how is it coming about? I want to dig a little deeper here into God's sovereign choice of election because the Bible does not show us everything. There's so much mystery. We could explore everything the Bible says and there's still so much mystery. And I'd be the first one to raise my hand and tell you that. But the Bible does allow us to peer into the mystery. It doesn't show us everything, but it does at least give us a glimpse into the mystery of when and how this happens. So again, if you're a Christian here this morning, and I don't assume that's all of you, and I'll speak to everybody by the end of the sermon, that means God chose you and God called you like God chose and called Abraham, like God chose and called Israel. But when did he do that? And why did he do that? I want to show you three brief answers the Bible gives which are all related to each other and I hope you can see they all make good sense together. First, first answer, when, how, when did this come about? First, God chose you, the Bible teaches, before the foundation of the world. God chose you before the foundation of the world. I'm taking this from Ephesians 1. It's already been read once this morning, but if you want to turn there, these are explosive verses at the beginning of Ephesians. I'm taking this from Ephesians 1 and verses 3 and 4, which say this, blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even as, watch this, even as he chose us in him, in Christ, before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. If, if you're a Christian, Paul is telling you that your story of coming to Christ and being made new in him, which is what it means to be a Christian, to find new life by faith in Christ, that story Paul is saying began before you said any prayer, before you heard your first sermon, before you were even born, before the world itself had been created. If you want to timestamp this, you have to timestamp it somewhere before Genesis 1-1. All right, wrap your minds around that. God chose you in Christ before the foundation of the world. In Revelation 13, John, the writer of the book, sees a vision, and in the vision there's an evil beast, and he has an army of followers from all the nations. So these are all people who are against God and who are not reconciled to God through Jesus by faith. So all of God's enemies, all of God's enemies, the evil beast has an army of the enemies of God from every tribe, tongue, and nation. And then Jesus, the lamb, has his own army of followers. And so the beast has an army, and the lamb has an army, each from every tribe, tongue, and nation. So from the nations are armies, and they're on a sort of collision course. And Revelation 13-8 says this, an authority was given to the beast, the evil beast. Authority was given to the beast over every tribe, and people, and language, and nation, and over all who dwell on the earth and worship it. And here's who's in that army and how they got to be in there. Everyone whose name has not been written before the foundation of the world in the book of life of the lamb who is slain. I'm gonna read that again because I think that's unbelievable and also a mouthful and a headache. Authority was given it to the beast over every tribe, and tongue, and language, and nation, and all who dwell on the earth will worship it, will worship the beast. Who will worship the beast? Everyone whose name has not been written before the foundation of the world in the book of life of the lamb who was slain. This is one of those times, there are a lot of times like this, but this is totally one of those times where I wish to do anything. I could stop the author, in this case it would be John, and say, whoa, pause, time out. What did you just say? And what did you just mean by that? And what are you referring to? There's evidently a book which was written by God before the foundation of the world, and it's a book about the life of the lamb who was slain. So its main chapters, this book written before time, its main chapters have to be about the cross, it has to be about the resurrection of Jesus, and in that book, maybe the longest part of that book, I'm jumping to conclusions here, but maybe the longest part of that book is a list of names it has. And those names are every name, every single name of the sea of people from every tribe, and tongue, and nation who are joined to the lamb, who are joined to Jesus. Can you just stop for a second? I understand this is apocalyptic imagery, and so revelation and books like this are wild and crazy, and sometimes a tree doesn't mean a tree, but it represents something. It represents real reality. Can you just stop for a second and imagine opening up that gigantic, if you could somehow get your hands on it, and opening up that gigantic, it's got to be massive, probably glowing book, and starting to thumb through its contents. You've been allowed access. And kids, I imagine if there are pictures in the book, there's a lot of gruesome pictures of this dying, suffering, bleeding man with a crown of thorns, but then those pictures ultimately, as you keep turning the pages, give way to his taking a crown, and rising from the dead, and sitting on a throne, and ruling with a scepter, because he's now the king of all the universe. And then you make your way to the back, which is actually, you know, you get to sort of the end of the story, but in the back, I imagine, I'm imagining, sanctified imagination, I hope, in the back there's there's a special appendix, and it's a list of names, and you can see pretty quickly that those names are written in alphabetical order, and it's just hundreds, and hundreds, and thousands, and thousands of pages of thousands, upon thousands, upon thousands of names. And that's not your thing, because who wants to read a chapter with just names? Who wants to sit around and read genealogies? But curiosity gets the best of you. You see they're in alphabetical order, so you can't help but to flip over to the F's. And could you just imagine for a moment, if in this book, written before time, you, and I know right now you're me, but you do you, you find in this glowing heavenly book, Felton Stephen Matthew, 1984, or maybe 2002, or whenever I was actually converted, what would you do if you saw your name in the back of that book, written before time, the book of the life of the Lamb? I imagine you'd, I don't know, I imagine you'd fall down and cry, and sing, and scream, and tell everybody, what would you do if you got your hands on this book? If you're a Christian, your name is in that book. And it's been there before there were trees, or oceans, or stars. God chose you, Paul says, before the foundation of the world. Secondly, God chose you before you were born, which of course must be true if he chose you before the foundation of the world. Again, these things work together. God chose you before you were born. I want to read for you now, if you want to turn there, from the epic, controversial, massively important passage in chapter of Romans chapter 9. It's one of the most surprising, but also clearest statements in the Bible on election. Paul is, in Romans 9, talking about his own people, his countrymen, the Jews, the Israelites, and he's talking about why so many of them have rejected Jesus, and are rejecting Paul, and his message, and therefore are outside of God's grace, even though God has given to them all the promises of salvation. Think about what we saw in Genesis, people, place, blessing, all given to this promised people, and yet the Messiah is here, he's come from their nation, and a lot of them are rejecting him. That's a problem that people are, it seems like God's word has failed, God's promises are failed. That apparent problem is the problem that Paul is answering in Romans 9, and his answer to that problem is election. God has always, Paul said, always purposed to to follow, if you want to follow along, and not only so, but also when Rebecca had conceived children by one man, our forefather Isaac, though they were not yet born, and had done nothing either good or bad, in order that God's purpose of election might continue, not because of works, but because of him who calls. She was told, Rebecca was told, the older will serve the younger, as it is written, this is a quote about God, Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated. Now the first time I read that, the first time I read that, I immediately tried to think of all the reasons, I think I was 18 the first time I read that, I immediately tried to think of all the reasons, that could not mean what it just said, and I wonder, I wonder if there are some of you, some of us, who are very inclined to do the same thing right now. Paul's conclusion, if we could start there, verse 11, his conclusion is God's purpose of election is based not upon works, but upon his call. Paul's proof of that is Jacob and Esau, and how while they were still in Rebecca's womb, God chose Jacob and not Esau. Therefore, Paul's point is very clear, therefore you cannot possibly say that his choice of Jacob has anything to do with anything he saw from Jacob or from Esau. After all, neither one has been born. Now I don't, I don't pretend to, I would never ask, hey are all your questions answered about this, but do you see Paul's point, his argument, before they were even born. Third, third thing I want to show you with respect to the source, the origin of election, God chose you before you believed, before you believed, which again, of course, must be true if God chose you before you were born and before the foundations of the world. God must have chosen you before you leave. I'll show you this, I can show you this in a lot of different ways, I'll show you this just briefly from Acts 13 and verse 48. So if you want to turn there, Acts 13 and verse 48. Paul and Barnabas are, are sent to a new city here to preach the gospel and they go into this new city and they preach the gospel in the synagogues to their fellow Jews. Some in the synagogues hear them, but many revile them and curse them and so Paul and Barnabas announce that they're, okay fine, you, you reject us, we're going to hit the streets and we're going to the Gentiles, we're going to the Gentiles, we're going to preach to the Gentiles and then we read this in verse 48. And when the Gentiles heard this, that is heard the gospel preached by Paul and Barnabas, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed. Think carefully about that phrase because it syncs up with everything else we've already seen. You might expect it to read, and as many as believed were then appointed to eternal life. That is not what it says. So you, you, you might assume that, you know, Paul goes out to a, uh, just a crowd of Gentile free agents and he preaches the gospel and the ones that believe, okay, God writes their name down in heaven, eternal life. It's not what it says. It says the reverse of that. It says God had already written down their names. If we're doing a little theology here, God has already written down their names before the foundation of the world in the book of life of the book of the lamb. Therefore they believed. Therefore they believed. Of course they believed. Of course they believed. Their names were already written down before belief, before birth, and even before the world was created, God chose. God chose before they believed. God chose and so they believed. What I'm showing you in a word, in summary, what I'm showing you here in the second point is that election, as many have said, is unconditional. It's unconditional. In other words, it's not based upon any conditions that you meet or I meet. It's based upon one thing, God's sovereign choice made before the foundations of the world, which is his choice, totally free from any condition, totally free from any requirement. God elects and then we meet the conditions. Listen to Charles Spurgeon, who has a way with words, in his own autobiography, reflecting on this big, massive, but I would say clearly in the Bible, mysterious doctrine of election. Listen to his own personal engagement with it. I believe, Spurgeon says, in the doctrine of election. Here's why. Because I am quite certain that if God had not chosen me, I should never have chosen him. And I am sure he chose me before I was born or else he never would have chosen me afterwards. And he must, I am sure, have elected me for reasons unknown to me, for I never could find in myself any reason why he should have looked upon me with special love. And so I am forced to accept that great biblical doctrine of election. Isn't there something, if you're a Christian here this morning, whatever questions you have about this, isn't there something about that word that deeply resonates with your soul and your story? It must be due to some mysterious sovereign purposes of God, because surely it can't have anything to do with what's in here, because I know what's in here. Before belief, before time, before birth, election. I know this is hard to grasp, maybe even hard to accept, and I have so much more to say on the matter. At least two or three or four more S's for me and thesaurus.com to come up with as we finish the sermon next week. The Bible has much more to say on the matter, but that's enough for part one. And I want to, in closing, invite you to respond. So maybe you're here and you're not a Christian. Maybe you're here and you were invited, and this is the first time you're trying church out. What a strange sermon to hear. Let me be really clear, because the Bible is really clear. You, if you're not a believer, and I know many in this room are not yet in Christ, that's always true. You, upon hearing the gospel, must believe. Because if you don't, if you refuse grace, if you refuse the message of the gospel, Christ's death and resurrection for your sins, if you refuse Jesus as king, you will not be saved. And if you will believe, if you will turn to Jesus, God will never turn anyone away. Period. The entire Bible is clear about that. Paul is clear about that. Romans is clear about that. I don't want anybody to be confused about that. I could very well imagine your confusion hearing what I've just talked about. Like, you may be asking, okay, well, I'm unsure if, or I know I don't believe, or I'm unsure if I believe. And preachers saying, well, it's all based upon God's choice, which happened before time. And here I am not believing, so I guess I'm out. Now, hang on a second. You're here, aren't you? You're hearing me preach the gospel to you this morning, aren't you? Do you know there are millions of people right now who have never heard of Jesus and of the cross? And we're, that's why we believe in, participate in missions. We're trying to get the gospel to every tongue, tribe, nation. And yet here you are hearing me tell you right now, God sent his only son, Jesus, because he loves you. And that his son died for you and for your sins because he loves you. And that his son was raised from the dead, victorious over sin and death to save you. None of us were born believing that. Self-included. We all have to decide whether or not we believe and we'll follow Jesus. Nobody's denying that. Certainly not me. I'm just giving you this morning the backstory, the prequel to faith, to salvation, to preaching, to evangelism. And I'm telling you that the powerful grace that's behind it all is before time grace. Grace that originated before time. And I would ask you if you're here this morning, you're not a believer. Isn't there something in that which resonates with you? Especially if you know, if you're aware of your sin. Isn't there something in you that wants to believe this? Come to Jesus. Finally, a brief word to the church or to the to the elect exiles of Loudoun County of Northern Virginia united to the Trinity Church of Loudoun. And I will say much more again by way of applying this doctrine next week if you'll come back and give me a second audience. But whatever you, I want to say now, whatever you think of this doctrine, whatever questions you have, maybe even disagreements with certain ways I've framed things this morning, that does not change the fact that God chose you. If you take this, this doctrine, I take this, and it causes us to swell in pride as often happens, I just want to point out what could be more utterly foolish than to hear from the Bible, from the preacher, it actually has nothing to do with you. It started before time to take that and to swell with pride because we know better with other. How foolish to be, that's what we do, that's what sin is, fundamentally foolish. This isn't a battering ram, this teaching, this is not a battering ram to club you over the head with or your friends over the head with and to win an argument. I don't care about winning any arguments this morning. This is, this teaching is at its core, God loves you. And he loves you way more than you could possibly imagine. And he's loved you for way longer than you had any idea. He's loved you even from before you were born, even from before time when he wrote your name in the book of life. I want to say that's true, even if you're hearing this teaching for the first time, I want to say that's true, even if you struggle with this teaching or disagree with parts of what I said, it's still true and that's good news for you. Because that's how great and how sturdy and how entirely not dependent upon us God's love is and all of God's love from before time to the end of time in glory. And that's the best news of all, isn't it? Let me pray for us. God, we thank you for your word and we thank you that your word has things which surprise us and which challenges us and pushes up against things we assume or things that feel like they must be true or logical to us. For after all, God, you are God and we're not. And we encountered a book that just agreed with everything we already thought made perfect sense to us. What kind of God would have written that book? So God, thank you for your word. We pray that you would awaken in our hearts fresh awe and wonder and humility in all of our hearts. And God, we pray that you would allow us to see the fruit of the harvest of salvation in new lives, young and old, even this morning, of souls who say yes to you and to Jesus as king because you've chosen them before time. We pray you would show your power in Jesus' name. Amen.
