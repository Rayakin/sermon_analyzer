John 6, 35 through 37 and verse 40, Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life, whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst. But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe. All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out. For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in Him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day. This is the word of the Lord. I walked into the church, my friend invited me to attend, and I immediately felt a presence unknown to me. I knew beyond any doubt that I was in the presence of the Holy Spirit. At the end of the service, the preacher's wife prophesied that someone in the room was hesitating. I knew it was directed at me. So I accepted Jesus and my life changed. I was up until that moment held captive by a sinful addiction that I could not get rid of no matter how hard I tried. That day, that moment, the addiction was completely lifted from me. Something happens when you accept Jesus into your life. Victory is yours. Illnesses and addictions are zapped by grace. That day, I was zapped by grace. That's the testimony of a professing believer in Jesus. I read it to you not to mock the person who wrote it or to cast suspicion on their words. I hope what I just read is true and really happened. But I read it to you because that language, zapped by grace, is really fascinating to me and I think is how a lot of us think about grace and about salvation. Like it's something that just happens to us almost accidentally. We're just walking along some day and we're zapped. So almost like, if you're into Greek mythology, like Medusa, but the opposite. So Medusa, you look at her eyes, she looks at you, you turn into stone. Grace is sort of the opposite of that. You look at God or God looks at you and you're brought to life. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that zapped a soul like me. Is that how this works? Is that how grace works? Is that how you think about grace? So far in this series on the doctrines of grace, I think this is the, I don't know, fifth or sixth installment and we'll wrap this up next week. But here's what we've seen so far, if you're picking up with us here for the first time or if you just need a reminder. So far, here's what I've tried to show you. Number one, first week, God is way bigger than you ever imagined. Which you have to get that in your mind and your heart because if you don't, when you come to the Bible, you're just gonna always squeeze it, force it into what you already assume to be true about God and about yourself. God is way bigger than you ever imagined and so when we come to the Bible, we fundamentally bow. And whatever it says of God, we ought not to be surprised when we meet a God who blows up our categories. God is way bigger than you ever imagined. Secondly, I showed you, you and I are far worse off than you ever imagined. Totally depraved, the Bible teaches. Far worse is our condition in our sin before Jesus apart from God's work, apart from grace. Far worse off than you or I ever imagined. Thirdly, the story of grace begins, I tried to show you, before time. So God has loved you. If you are in Christ, God has loved you for far longer than you ever imagined. So we looked at grace which began before time. We looked at what the Bible teaches in the doctrine of election. And then last week, we looked further at grace as grace comes into time as we looked upon the cross and how God at Calvary purchased a people for himself by his powerful sheep securing grace displayed at the cross at Calvary. This morning we're asking, how does grace come into your life? So Calvary, 2,000 years ago, souls secured, but this morning we're asking, how does grace come into your life and my life if you're a Christian or if someday you shall become a Christian? In other words, how does one become a Christian? So if you have a Bible, I want to invite you now to turn with me to John chapter 6, the same passage that that lovely, lovely young woman read for us just moments ago. John chapter 6, and I want to make four basic observations from this passage, from just these few verses, for your life and for your salvation. Four observations about grace and how grace comes into, collides into your life, my life, and your salvation. So number one, Jesus is the all-satisfying bread of life. Jesus is the all-satisfying bread of life. For a little bit of context, as we arrive to these verses, towards the end of John chapter 6, a large crowd has gathered around Jesus and Jesus asks Philip, one of his followers, in verse 5, where do we buy bread? Where are we to buy bread, Philip? It is a test. John tells us it's a test to set the stage for what's about to happen with Jesus and this crowd gathered around who becomes hungry. So Jesus then finds a boy with five loaves of bread and two fish. He gives thanks to his father and then he feeds the entire crowd with this bread and these two fish. This, John tells us, is a sign, which is a really big deal and idea in the book of John. There are seven signs. I think this is the fourth of the seven signs as Jesus is revealing to the people, to the world, who he indeed is by these signs. The people, after this sign, after all this bread, after their bellies are full, are in awe and they storm to Jesus. They flock to Jesus, which does not impress Jesus at all. I'm a church planter. We planted this church, I and others, and so in church planting, the game is who can draw a crowd. Jesus could draw a crowd unlike anybody else and it did not impress him at all. His typical move was to draw a crowd and then say things which repelled the crowds and drove them right away. So verse 27 of John chapter six, you can see just how unimpressed Jesus is by the frenzy of this crowd. Don't work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. You do all this for food, he says? You're all worked up over bread when you're gonna be hungry again in a few hours, he says? He calls for, not a frenzy, but for faith, for belief, but they beg him for a sign. They say, our fathers received manna in the wilderness. That's what Moses did for our fathers. What can you do for us, Jesus? And that's where we're gonna pick up in verse 32. That's the scene here. If you look down at verse 32 of chapter six, Jesus, they've just asked for a sign. Moses gave us a sign. Moses gave us the manna. What more can you? You gave us the bread. They want still more. What can you do for us, Jesus? Jesus then said to them, truly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world. They said to him, sir, then give us this bread always. I want you to see, he has them now. They're hooked. He's got them eating from the palm of his hands. Their mouths are watering. Their souls are leaping with hope now. Their stomachs are growling for this bread that he's talking about. Look at verse 35. Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst. When you're hungry, what do you think about? When you're hungry, all you can think about is food. When you're not hungry and certain commercials come on the television, especially Taco Bell, all of a sudden, what can you even, full stomach, what can you think about other than food? One of my, I don't know how this became a thing, but one of my present day, late night wind down routines before I go to bed is I watch YouTube cooking shorts, shorts, like the 30 second videos, 15, I don't know, 15 second videos. I don't cook. I watch them always when I've already had dinner, and yet always, I watch these videos and all I can think about food, and so I end up going back into the cabinet and searching for more food and snacking. Hunger is powerful, yeah? Your soul is hungry too. That's what Jesus is appealing to here and what he's after here. Our souls, everybody's soul is starving for something, for anything that will satisfy it, and so you look and I look to girlfriends or boyfriends and to husbands and wives or to images and clicks or to pleasure and so you and I look to fun and to games and to sports and to entertainment and we live our lives vicariously through our favorite teams and they never win, do they? Our team, they never seem to win, which is part of the fall in this world and it's so devastating, but actually it's also a little secret insider for those of us who've lived long enough to see one of our teams actually win. It's a good mercy in your life, a grace from God in your life that your team never does finally pull it out at the end. You know why? Because when they win, it's so sweet for a moment and then like a day later, you realize you're just as miserable as before. The Red Sox breaking the curse, it was awesome and I've moved on. They stink the next year. You look to work, I look to purpose, to money, to power, to control and stuff that money can buy. We're always looking because our souls are always hungering, everybody is always forever looking for something to satisfy their soul, fill them up and give them rest. Ecclesiastes, the book of Ecclesiastes in the Bible is an entire book about this guy called Preacher. That's what Ecclesiastes means, it's a guy called Preacher and the book chronicles his journey throughout the entire world. The entire globe he travels looking for stone and rare stone and turning every pebble and rock he finds over and looking underneath pleasure and money and everything else looking for something to satisfy his soul and at the end of the book, the conclusion he comes to again and again and again is vanity of vanities. Everything is vanity. You ever feel like that? If you haven't felt that in your soul, vanity of vanities, all is vanity, yet you just need to keep on living because that's life in a fallen world. Everybody is searching for something to quench their thirst and to satisfy their hunger. That's why these crowds, when Jesus starts talking to them about life giving bread are all in and I want you to see Jesus having drawn a crowd, then looks them in the eye, having hooked them with this idea of eternally satisfying bread and he says to them in verse 35, I am the bread of life. I would publicly confess to you, I have four daughters and the baby is one and a half years old and every once in a while when I really need her to come to me for whatever, to feed her, to take care of her, to change her, to whatever and she won't come to me after calling to her because she's one and a half and absolutely filled with sin and so every once in a while what I'll do and parents you know this and this is not a good thing, this is surely probably sin in our own lives but I'll hold out my hand like this and her little mind, you can just see her exploding with what you know, she can only imagine the greatest toy or the greatest piece of candy has to be in my hand and then I call her over and she always comes in and then she opens it up and there's nothing in there but air and here's what I want you to see. I know that's terrible parenting but I want you to see. I imagine that is a lot like what those crowds felt in John 6 after Jesus got their stomachs churning about bread from heaven that gives life everlasting and then at the moment of revelation says, I am that bread. Look down to verse 48. I am the bread of life, saying it again, I am the bread of life. Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and they died. This is the bread that comes down from heaven so that one may eat of it and not die. What is that bread? I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever and the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh. Do you see it's the same audacious claim he's making, I am this eternally satisfying bread. Everything you're searching for, all you've ever wanted but didn't know where to find it, every craving you've ever had, all just, Jesus is saying, all just shadows pointing to him and here he is. We sing sometimes, we will look to him, our soul's eternal reward. Our soul's satisfaction, that's what Jesus was claiming. That's what the Bible is saying. Jesus is the all satisfying, eternal bread of life sent from God, which raises a really interesting question I think. If Jesus was the real manna from heaven, the real manna, the all satisfying bread of life, then how could the people who saw him with their own eyes, face to face, who watched him, heard him, looked at him, touched him, how could those people so easily walk away? Isn't that an interesting question? That's exactly what happened. Look at verse 36. Right after saying he's the bread of life, the big reveal, verse 36 says, but I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe. Jesus could draw a crowd like the best of them, but the crowds faded. They always faded. How can that be? Second thing I want to show you from these verses, hopefully to get at an answer to that massive question, no one comes to Jesus unless the father draws him. No one comes to Jesus unless the father draws him. I'm taking this directly from verse 44 to start out with. Look down at verse 44. No one can come to me unless the father, Jesus says, who sent me draws him. Just in case you think this is like a typo or maybe a scribe got this wrong, look down at verse 65. He makes the same point all over again in case you missed it the first time, verse 65. Jesus said, this is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted to him or her by the father. After this, John records, many of his disciples turned back and no longer walked with him. They got the point of the message. They were offended by it and unimpressed by it perhaps. At any rate, they walked away. What is Jesus saying here? What does he mean? No one can come to me unless the father who sent me draws him. Here's what Jesus is saying, mankind on his own, on her own, will not, even more, cannot come to God. Mankind on his own will not, even more than that, cannot come to God. This goes back to the beginning of the series and the biblical teaching I started with of total depravity. You and I are far worse off, spiritually speaking, in our souls than you ever imagined. It's not just that we've done a little wrong and we have some guilt upon us. It's far worse than that. It's that we're now dead, spiritually speaking, and unable to course correct, unable to exert any spiritual life positively towards God on our own. Think about with me just for a few minutes. Think about the different images that the Bible uses to describe our condition universally, mankind, our condition in our sin. There are many images the Bible uses to capture us in our sin. I want to show you four just to get the point across. Number one, the Bible describes us as blind. In our sins, we are blind, blind to God's truth. Second Corinthians 4.4. I'm going to look at these verses a little more carefully in a few minutes. But Second Corinthians 4.4, you don't have to turn there, but Second Corinthians 4.4 says this. The God of this world, I know this sounds confusing, but he's talking about Satan there. That's why the God is a lowercase g there. The God of this world has blinded the minds of unbelievers to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ. We were so blind in our sin and by our sin that we could see the gospel right in front of us and look right through it and not register anything in our souls. We were so blind in our sin that the Son of God could stand and speak before us and we could lose interest and move on just as quickly to the next guy as soon as he fed us a little bread. We'd rather look for a politician, a rabble rouser, a magician, blind by our sin. A second way the Bible describes us in our sin is the image of slavery. We were also enslaved to sin. John 8.34, everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin. You ever committed a sin? Any sin. Just one. Everyone who commits sin, any sin, just one, is a slave of sin. Romans 6.17, you, Paul says to a church, a group of new believers, you who were once slaves of sin. We were so enslaved to our sin that we had no power or ability to set ourselves free, to turn away from our sin and worship God. Our wills, the way the Bible talks about our wills is they were captured and enslaved and no longer capable of breaking free. I'd love to have a conversation with you about free will. The Bible teaches that your wills, apart from Jesus, are enslaved and must be set free from the master of sin. That's why Paul says in Romans 9.16, so then it depends, our salvation depends not on human will or exertion, but on God who has mercy. We were enslaved. Third image the Bible uses to capture us in our sin, aliens. We were alienated from God. Alienated from God. Romans 1.21, and you who once were alienated and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds. Ephesians 4.18, alienated, Paul says, we were before Christ, alienated from the life of God. Think about that image. The life of God. The life that is in God. Salvation life. Alienated from the life of God due to our hardness of heart. Listen, we were so alienated from God that wickedness became normal. And so alienated from God and the life that is in God that the holiness and purity of God became a strange, a foreign, even a repulsive thing to us. Think about how this plays out today. Christians are considered morally evil at large by many in our society and in our culture. Now some of that may be self-inflicted and the result of our own hypocrisy. But much of that is because our culture is so depraved and so itself alienated, estranged from God, that what is actually good and pure and holy sounds to our culture dark and evil. God help us. Fourth image the Bible uses to describe us, capture us, in our sin as a sort of summary of us in our sin is dead. Dead to spiritual life in God, Ephesians 2 verse 1, and you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked. We were dead in our sins. And listen, there's, in case you were confused about the matter, there's no partial dead. You know, like, well, he's a little dead. He's kind of, she kind of died. Dead is dead. You're dead or alive. They're mutually exclusive categories, meaning you, I, before Jesus, apart from grace, had no spark of life in you or me for God to take and ignite into flame, no potential, no remaining life in us, no hope, dead. Just like those crowds in John 6. That's why they saw Jesus, heard Jesus, heard about this life-giving, soul-satisfying bread he's come to offer and drew near to him, hooked by his words, and then saw Jesus open up his hands and say, I am the bread of life that satisfies eternally, and they walked away. They were blind. They were enslaved. They were alienated. They were dead. That's why they could hear, see, touch the bread of life and walk away still blind in their sins. That's, actually, if you think about it, that's no mystery at all. The real mystery, and a far better question we should ask, and I should try to answer from the Bible, is how can anyone enslaved by sin, blind to and alienated from God, dead to life in God, ever come to Jesus? How's that possible? Third thing I want to show you from this passage, third observation, everyone who the Father gives to Jesus comes to him. Everyone who the Father gives to Jesus comes to him. I'm taking this directly from verse 37. If you want to look there again, Jesus says, all that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me, I will never cast out. Look at all the movement and activity in that one verse. The Father gives these people to Jesus, and so these people then come to Jesus, and then Jesus keeps them forever. He doesn't lose a single one of them. This is so closely related to what we've already seen in this series. God chose a people before time, and he wrote their names in the book of life. Before they were even born, God chose a people for himself. God then sent Jesus, who came for these people, and who died for these people, saying, promising, I lay down my life for the sheep. Here we're seeing that having come for them, having died for them, Jesus now calls them, by his voice, calls them to himself. Do you see? I want to teach you something now that I think will really help you to make sense of your Bible and help you to put together different verses that seem really difficult to put together, because if we're honest, you read these ones, and then you read these ones. They almost seem like they contradict each other. I want to teach you about two different calls of Jesus, calls, C-A-L-L-S, two different calls of Jesus, which are both given out to mankind, and I think they help us to make sense of all these different passages in the Bible that can be confusing at first glance. I want to teach you about a gospel call, or the gospel call, and then what people who study the Bible have often called the effectual call. So two calls, a gospel call, and an effectual call. Jesus sometimes, again, makes it sound like he's only calling to his sheep. Haven't you noticed that? That's the first verse we just read. All that the Father gives me will come to me. Sometimes he makes it sound like he only calls out to his sheep, and they will all hear. He's clear. They will all hear my voice and come and believe and be saved because they know my voice. I know my sheep, and my sheep know me, he says. But Jesus other times, have you noticed, is really clear that he calls out to everybody, and that some hear, but others reject his voice, and this grieves him and grieves his heart. What's going on there? Well, these are two different calls of God, two different calls coming from his Son, Jesus Christ. Let me show you the difference. You ready? You ready? The gospel call. First of all, what do we mean by the gospel call? Let me tell you a few things about the gospel call. It's external. It's external. By that, I mean you can hear it. You can see it if you're reading it on a page. Anybody can hear it. Anybody with ears and eyes can hear and see the gospel call. It's external. It's also universal in that it goes out to everybody, and for everybody, it goes out to all of mankind. So let me give you an example. Matthew 11, verse 28, Jesus says, come to me, all you who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest. What is that he's just given? It's an invitation, isn't it? And who does that invitation go to? It goes out to every man and woman and boy and girl who's ever lived or who will ever live on this earth. It's an open invitation to everybody. So it's universal. This gospel call is an expression of the genuine love of God for all mankind everywhere. Every man, woman, boy, and girl, God loves them, and so he gives out this call. Jesus died and was raised from the dead and is reigning in heaven now to purchase this right for me to stand up before you all and give this call on Jesus' behalf. This call can be received, last thing I want to show you, it can be received, but it can also be resisted. In fact, many times Jesus makes clear, or writers of the Bible make clear, that there is a call that comes from God, that goes out from God, from Jesus Christ through the Holy Spirit, that can be and indeed is all the time resisted. Let me just give you a couple of examples. Matthew, don't have to turn there, Matthew 23, 37, Jesus famously weeping, oh, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it. How often, listen to these words, how often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and yet you were not willing. Do you hear Jesus acknowledging the rejection of his own people in Jerusalem? Acts 7, verse 51, Stephen, right before he's stoned to death, gives this life-ending, death-approaching, blood-curdling cry, you stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always, he's addressing his own countrymen, Stephen is, you always resist the Holy Spirit. As your fathers did, so do you. So this is the gospel call that God gives out, that the Son purchased, that the Spirit communicates, it's external, it's universal, it's a genuine expression of the genuine, sincere love of God. It can be received or resisted, but the Bible also talks about another call, the effectual call. Let me describe this to you and show you a bit of it from the Bible. This, unlike the gospel call, is internal. By that I mean it's secret. The one receiving it, hearing it, can hear it, but nobody else necessarily can. God is speaking to you, maybe in a powerful, saving way, I have no idea. It goes out, this call goes out to all that the Father has given to the Son. Think of all those passages we looked at last week and here again this morning. This call goes out to all that the Father has given to the Son. This call comes from the Father, is purchased by the Son through His death and resurrection, and comes through the Spirit, and therefore it comes with power, so it is always effective. Effectual, that's why we call it the effectual call. It is irresistible, I think the Bible teaches. Pick any really strong word you want, it'll still fit, because that's how God has imbued this call with His own power. Verse 37, that's what I think we're reading about here in John 6, all that the Father gives me will come to me. There's nothing in jeopardy here, all that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me, I will never cast out. This is, this call is the power of God, which comes in power to break free an enslaved will, to open up blinded eyes, to give birth to a new heart, calling forth faith, making alive, raising from the dead, and now reconciling to God. Do you see the difference between these two calls? You might not be sure. Go home and wrestle with your Bible yourselves, like always, every single week. We teach, you go home, be a good Berean, Acts 17, read the Bible, study the Word, see if what I'm saying is true. But do you see the difference between these two calls? Sometimes in the Bible, the two calls, the gospel call, the effectual call, appear right alongside and on top of each other. Let me give you a couple of examples. I read for you just a moment ago, Matthew 11, 28, come to me, Jesus says, all you who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest. That's a gospel call that goes out to everybody. The verse immediately before that, Matthew 11, 27, no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son, and anyone, watch this, to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him. What's that? That's an effectual call. That's the Son choosing to reveal Himself to those who are known by the Father, or even sometimes these two calls come in the same verse. Listen to Matthew 22, verse 14, many are called. I think the sense of many there is everybody potentially is called, but few are chosen. Think about that verse. Many are called. What's that? That's what I'm calling, what people besides me have called. I'm not making this up. The gospel call. Many are called, but few are chosen. What's that? That's the effectual call. That's the power of God. That's the saving power and the saving call of God. So still confused perhaps, may I demonstrate? Boys and girls, ladies and gentlemen, may I demonstrate? You've got to talk to me. All right. I'm going to do my best to demonstrate what I'm talking about here, and I want to ask you to please listen very carefully, all right? For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, and His only begotten Son, there is no other. His only begotten Son became a human just like you, except that He was like you in every way except that He never sinned. Never once did this special man sin. That means He was holy. Unlike anyone else on the entire earth, He was holy, and that's why the world hated Him. Because the world was alienated from God and His holiness, and so the world saw holiness and hated it, lashed out against it, and killed it. Because His holiness was blinding to us. His purity was alien to us. His light exposed our darkness, and so we hated it and killed it. But this was His Father's plan, and it was also His plan to die, to be killed even, because that's what it took to deal with our spiritual death and deadness and blindness. It took His death. It took God's wrath. It took God's judgment upon Him. He died in our place for our sins, for my sins, for your sins. God crushed His Son. God crushed the light for our darkness. Can you believe it? And He really did die. Our death to bring us to life. After being buried dead in the grave for three days, God raised Him back to life by His own power. So He, Jesus, the Son of God, conquered death and the grave. He did that. Listen to me. He did that for you. I mean you, plural. I mean you, universal. He did that for you, and He did that for all of you. If you'll stop running away from God like a rebel, turn around, believe in Jesus, and give your life to Him. If you will give Him your life, that's what the Bible calls faith, you'll too be raised with Him. You'll be washed totally of your sins. You'll conquer the grave when you die too in His name, and you'll be reconciled to God forever. Amen? Now what just happened? What did I just do? I just preached the gospel. I just gave that first call. I just gave a gospel call to every single person in this room. It was for everybody, no footnotes, no wink-winks. You all heard it. I hope you listened to it, but maybe, just maybe, some of you, one of you, just one of you heard through my feeble words the very voice of God, the very call of God. If you did, it's not because I put those words together in a fresh way or because I'm some great preacher. It's because, it'll only be because the Spirit of God came through my feeble words and called out to your heart, and oh God, let that be true today, and come tell us in a minute that you want to follow Jesus, and let us tell you what it means to follow Jesus, and let us figure out how to get you baptized, and let's go on to glory together. Do you see the difference? Gospel call. I can give that. You can give that. We must give that effectual call. God alone can give that, and God will give that. Let me tell you what wonderful news this is, not just for me as a preacher, but for you as an evangelist. I preach, and every week I preach, I try to share the gospel. And I could stand up here, and I could call the band back up, and I have them string it. I say, heads bowed, eyes closed, let's turn the lights down as low as possible, let's drum up the guitar, and let me see those hands. And some of you might have been saved this way, and again, I'm not meaning to mock. I just have a mocking personality, but I'm not trying to mock anybody. Let me see those hands, and let me see them raised, and no hands come up. And so what do we do? Come on, guitar player, ramp it up a little. Ah, yes. I see that hand. Let me see that. Why would I do that? I would do that for one reason. If I thought heaven and hell and salvation came down to me and my words and my ability to get you to make some decision in some moment, but it doesn't. Salvation rests in God's hands and in God alone. That's wonderful news. You know what that means? That means I preach the gospel. I do the best I possibly can. I actually, believe it or not, think hard about these words. I edit them. I write and rewrite. I give them the best of my possible abilities, and then I go home and feel like I still sort of failed, but I did the best that I could, but I also go to sleep at night. You know why I go to sleep at night? Because God has the power to save. I persuade you, with your neighbors, with your friends, with your family members who are lost. Persuade. Think about your words. Keep after them, but pray, pray, pray, pray, pray, and go to sleep at night because God has the power to save and not you or me. Gospel call, an effectual call. Long my, we love to sing the song, And Can It Be. Long my imprisoned spirit lay, Fast bound in sin and nature's night. Just imagine this is like a person in a cave laying down in a tomb, as it were. Thine eye diffused a quickening ray. That means a life-giving ray. I woke the dungeon flame with light. God alone, power to save. Ray of God, effectual call of God. Fourth, final thing I want to show you. The power, and really, I want to bring everything home here, so don't lose me yet. The power of God, which draws anyone to faith, is looking upon Jesus. Let me say that again, I know it's a mouthful. But I think this is what, in the passage, Jesus says, clearly reveals, which brings together everything I've showed you and ties it up into a little bow. The power of God, which draws anyone to faith, is looking upon Jesus. I'm taking this from verse 40, if you want to look there again. For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in Him should have eternal life. For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks upon the Son and believes in Him should have eternal life. So here's the question. In real time and in real life, what makes any of you or me turn away from our sins and trust in God? If you're a Christian, if you've been walking with Jesus for a while, Him as your King, following Him, what made you to change from living your life unto yourself to now following Jesus and living for Him and trusting in God? What makes you want God more than a boyfriend or more than money or more than pornography or more than your own glory? One thing. This is what I want you to see. One thing, seeing and beholding Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Seeing and beholding Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Or to say it differently, feasting, eating, feasting by faith upon the all-satisfying bread of life. I want to invite you now to turn with me to 2 Corinthians 4. I told you I'm going to end here. I want to turn here because I think this so helpfully ties up Paul's own reflection here with what Jesus says here about looking upon the Son and how this all fits together. 2 Corinthians chapter 4, and I'm going to pick up in verse 3. This is actually the Apostle Paul wrestling with the question I presented earlier of how can ... The gospel's here. Jesus came. How can anybody reject Him if He really is what He claimed to be and who He claimed to be? How is that possible? This is Paul wrestling with that. Here's what he says. 2 Corinthians chapter 4, verse 3, and even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. In their case, the God of this world, that's Satan, has blinded the minds of the unbelievers to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. For God who said, let light shine out of darkness ... Now, that's in quotation marks. Where's Paul quoting from right there? That's Genesis chapter 1, God who said, let light shine out of darkness. There's nothing God speaks and He creates the heavens and the earth. The God who said, let light shine out of darkness, has shown in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. You believe, if you believe, because God, the same God who created the world by powerful words, where He spoke and there were trees and great white sharks and a ring around Saturn, He's spoken again in that same world-creating voice to your heart. He's caused you to turn by His voice and look. He's caused you to see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. I want you to think about the different stories in this room right now. Think about, especially if you belong to this church, the different testimonies we hear at every members meeting, every time we have a baptism up here. I want you to think about your own story, if you're here this morning and you're a follower of Jesus. Some of you were radically converted after lives of radical sin, addiction, crime. Some of you were, by your own testimony, an inch away from death. Some of you were converted from the lives of the little Pharisees, lives of church and of awanas and memory verses and an entire childhood without any swear words. Some of you were converted when you were so young that you honestly aren't sure or that sure when you first believed, which is totally okay. You know why? One of the biggest questions we get from our members is, are you believing now? Some of you come from the perfect Christian home where you receive the perfect classical Christian education. Some of you come from homes where you never once heard the gospel, where your parents to this day still don't believe what you believe or understand why you live for what you live for. Many of you come from broken homes where you were abandoned by parents, where you were really hurt by parents. Some of you have honestly lived pretty great lives thus far. You grew up with money and opportunity and you haven't thus far really dealt with that much sickness or death and just up, up, up you've lived thus far. Some of you have suffered horribly and wondered why God dealt you one deck of cards when so many others all around you seem to get it so easy. Anybody who thinks that we're all in this room and in a room like this, anybody who thinks we're all basically the same knows nothing but the most surface level assumptions about us. Whatever we have in common, none of us are the same. We come from all different kinds of backgrounds. There is just one thing that we all share exactly the same, at least the Christians in this room, and that one thing is grace. The God who said, let light shine out of darkness has shined his light in our hearts to open our eyes to the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ. We saw Jesus and found him beautiful, irresistible, bigger and better than everything else we'd been turning to for the rest of our lives before that moment. That's why I'm a Christian because I've tried many other things and I don't know what else to turn to. Listen, grace is not an idea or some substance floating around in the air that you can't see that maybe just maybe someday zaps you or doesn't zap you. Grace is a person. His name is Jesus. To him you must look. The great London preacher Charles Spurgeon was 15 years old and traveling through a London snowstorm alone to make his way to church, which is kind of amazing when you consider what I'm about to read for you by his own testimony. He was not yet a Christian and yet he was going to church on his own, 15 years old through a snowstorm. Amazing. The storm was so bad that he finally gave up and turned into a small Methodist chapel halfway to his destination and right in the heart of London. He gathered together. He found himself in a room with a handful of other congregants. He sat there in silence along with the rest of them who were evidently waiting for the minister to arrive. The minister never showed up. He was himself snowed in. And so eventually Spurgeon said, a thin man walked up to the pulpit. Spurgeon guessed, he didn't know, never got the guy's name, but he guessed that he was probably a tailor or a shoemaker. The thin man walked up to the pulpit, opened up his Bible and he read this verse from Isaiah 55, look unto me and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth. He talked for about 10 minutes from this verse and then he just stopped. He was done. Spurgeon figured, he guessed that he stopped because he didn't have anything else left to say. You should be so lucky when I'm preaching. Then Spurgeon said, having finished his talk, he looked at me, probably because I was the only stranger in the room and he just stared at me. And with all his heart, he said to me, young man, you look very miserable, which I was very miserable, but I wasn't accustomed, Spurgeon said, to being called out for it. And he continued, you always will be miserable, miserable in life and miserable in death if you do not obey my text. But if you obey now, this moment, you will be saved. Then Spurgeon said, the man lifted up his hands and shouted, young man, look to Jesus. Look, look, look. You have nothing to do but to look and live. And Spurgeon said, I looked and I saw at once the way of salvation. I was looking at that moment to do 50 things. Maybe some of you feel like that here this morning, 50 things you got to do to get right with God. I was looking to do 50 things, but when I heard that one word, look, oh, what a charming word it seemed to me. I looked until I almost looked my eyes away. There and then the cloud was gone and the darkness rolled away from my heart. I saw the sun. Listen, it's not my goal in this series to cause you to hate yourself for your sin or to cause arguments to break out over election or predestination or even really in a sense to cause you or lead you to obsess over your salvation by looking further and further inward inside of yourself. Get out of there. It's an abyss that leads to nowhere but to doubt or pride. Look at Jesus. He's the only one in all the universe powerful enough to save you from your sins. He's the only one in all the universe beautiful enough to set you free from your sins.
