Redemption stories, everybody loves redemption, especially this time of the year. It's a wonderful life. Ebenezer Scrooge, Tiger Woods winning the 2018 Masters. Everybody loves a good comeback from bad to good, from falling on hard times to restoration, an underdog, a recovery, from failure to victory, overcoming the odds, redemption, we all love redemption, it sells. In ancient history, redemption carried a different meaning, and this is the meaning of redemption we encounter in the Bible. To be redeemed meant and means to be set free or released through the actions and resources of one's stronger and thus able to redeem. Slaves were redeemed, prisoners were redeemed, debtors were redeemed. When Charles Dickens was 12 years old, his father incurred so much debt that he was forced, he was forced with his wife and his younger children to enter into a debtor's prison, which still existed at the time. Charles was forcibly separated from his parents, he being 12 years old at the time, and forced to live with an impoverished older lady who took him in. They remained separated, young Charles, from his parents and the rest of his family until Charles' grandmother died, leaving enough inheritance money to her son to set them free, thus reuniting the family. The entire experience was deeply scarring to Charles and opened his eyes to the harsh realities of the poor, themes which surface again and again throughout all of his writings, as in the Christmas carol, Tiny Tim. When our culture speaks of redemption and tells stories of redemption, we think, for instance, this time of the year, of Ebenezer Scrooge and his cold, greedy heart opening up. We think of the Grinch, redemption. When the Bible speaks of redemption, it rather imagines the money coming into Charles Dickens' father's hand and thus setting him free. Do you see the difference? They're related and overlapping, but slightly different in important ways. It is exactly such a set of circumstances we're encountering in the book of Ruth, which we've been exploring together throughout this month of December. Two widows, Ruth and Naomi, mother and daughter-in-law, having no resources to care for themselves and to provide for themselves. They're both, therefore, doomed to a life of poverty and begging in a man's world with no prospects for any life or any future. In chapter three, where we left off last Sunday, in the night, Ruth, the daughter-in-law, made an audacious move on Boaz, proposing to him and calling upon him to redeem her and also to redeem her mother-in-law, Naomi, to set them free. He agreed to do it, Boaz did, but there was a wrench, if you remember. We learned another relative closer to Naomi's former husband, Elimelech, closer than Boaz was, and therefore, closer in line to redemption. He had first rights, so to speak. Well, today, the story, this remarkable story, comes to a close with that matter of redemption still unresolved. This morning, I wanna give one last look as we explore chapter four. I wanna give one last look at the three main characters of the story, each in turn, and as we do so, I want to trace for you some of the major themes which we've encountered throughout this remarkable little book of Ruth. So first, I want us to take one final look together at the character of Boaz. The final chapter begins, if you're in chapter four of Ruth, turn there if you're not there already. The final chapter begins at the city gates of Bethlehem. You may remember from our time in Genesis that city gates were important places, centers of power and politics in ancient cities like Bethlehem, and that means they were also the places where legal matters, legal disputes and proceedings were carried out. So Boaz, in verse one, you'll see he takes his seat at the gate, and he has one purpose in mind as he takes his seat at the gate. He wants to settle the matter of redeeming Ruth and Naomi, but in order to do that, he needs to negotiate with this other redeemer, the one who is closer in line than he. And lo and behold, look at verse two, who shows up, actually in verse one, we read, behold, the redeemer of whom Boaz had spoken earlier in the last chapter came by. The behold there is emphatic and is meant to convey the surprise chance of this other important person we need to encounter happened to stumble by. It's a very similar touch that the author adds in chapter two where Ruth ventured out, you remember, into a field which just happened, the author says, it just happened to be a part of the field belonging to Boaz, who just happened to be Naomi's relative and thus a potential redeemer. That's one of the great lessons of, maybe a first great lesson of the book of Ruth. God in the random, God in the happenstances of life, God in the detours, always orchestrating history and your life, your little random life, always to accomplish his purposes, even when things feel random, maybe especially when things feel random. Lo and behold, here is the man, Elimelech's closest living relative, who therefore has the most rights as a potential redeemer to these ladies, the one man standing between Boaz and Ruth and really our happy ending. And so Boaz said, turn aside, friend, sit down here. The two men seated at the gate, negotiations begin. Boaz informs this other man of Naomi and of her situation, having come back from Moab, a desperate widow. In verse three, we actually notice we learn new information. Evidently, Elimelech, Naomi's former husband, who has died, evidently he owned a piece of land in Bethlehem, which has legally passed now to Naomi. But without any husband or son, Naomi has no way of working this land, no way of profiting from the land, and she's too poor to do anything with it, and so she's selling it off, effectively blotting out her family's name from the land of Israel, which again is effectively to be cursed. This is precisely, remember, if you can remember last week, this is precisely where a redeemer fits into the Bible story, in exactly such situations and circumstances as this. This man can step in, he can redeem this land, and thus preserve Elimelech's name and Naomi's well-being in the meantime. So look at verse four. Boaz says, so I thought I would tell you of it and say, buy it, buy the land in the presence of those sitting here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it. But if you will not redeem it, tell me that I may know, for there is no one besides you to redeem it, and I come next. And the man said, I will redeem it. No! No! What about Ruth and Boaz? The worthy man and the worthy woman and all that covering with wings like a redeemer, this ancient love story, which we've all been enraptured by. This stranger redeemer here is about to ruin everything about this story. He learns of the situation and to him, the situation represents a twofold opportunity. First, he can do a good thing for on behalf of a dead relative, the limeleck, and also take care of in the process his surviving widow. So he keeps the land and the family and he's caring for Naomi. But secondly, think about it. Naomi is an older woman. She's a widow. She has no sons, no surviving sons. That means when she eventually dies, which is probably, this man's doing the math in his head, which is probably sooner than later, given that she has no heir, this property is now entirely his. It's a good deal. He can do a good deed for the poor, for a poor relative. And in the process, he can grow his estate larger. Friends, this is what they call a win-win. Yeah, okay, he says, I'll do it. After all this buildup, is this really how this story's going to end? Calm down. Be patient and let Boaz work. Remember, he's a worthy man. He's also a very skilled businessman. It's at this point and only at this point that he opens up his other hand and reveals the entirety of the situation. Look at verse five. Then Boaz said, oh, and by the way, the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you also acquire Ruth, the Moabite, the widow of the dead, in order to perpetuate the name of the dead in his inheritance. Boaz says, you redeem the field, good, but you also redeem Ruth, who is a Moabite, who is also a widow, who is also young and still of childbearing age, and it will be your responsibility to see to it that that child continues the line of Elimelech and Naomi. This changes the math. Not just the land, Boaz says, and this stranger redeemer learns, also Ruth. And this man is responsible for, remember the Leveret laws, which he's entering into potentially here, and these overlapping redeemer laws. This man is responsible for seeing to Ruth having a child and, if possible, a son. Why? Because to continue Elimelech's line, what that means is, this man is to, if at all possible, by the grace of God, is to sire a child by Ruth, who is his new wife, and this child is not to, in a legal sense, even be his own son, it's to be Elimelech's son to continue the name of Elimelech and to continue the line of Elimelech. Any son they might have will be considered Elimelech's, and that son, when he grows up, guess what? That land becomes his land. That sweet deal just became a lot more sour in this man's mind, and so just like that, he's out. Verse six, then the redeemer said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I impair my own inheritance. Take, therefore, my right of redemption yourself, Boaz, for I cannot redeem it. Now, Boaz springs into legal action. He takes the sandal, this ancient custom that the narrator of Ruth needs to even remind his original audience that, yeah, this is something that they used to do. He takes the sandal, he strikes the deal, he calls for witnesses, and just like that, Boaz redeemed Naomi's land and Naomi and Ruth. Phew! Here we learn the cost of redemption, the concern of this chapter, chapter four, the final chapter, and really the entire book of Ruth. The main concern is Naomi and Ruth's redemption. We all want it, and so do the other characters in the book that Ruth and Naomi encounter. Nobody's, if you pay attention, nobody's really exactly rooting against them. It's sort of like us and, say, the beggar we see on the street. None of us are against him or his prosperity or his well-being. We all, if asked, if given some kind of opportunity, well, yeah, we want him, we don't know him, but we want this stranger to recover and do well. We're not against him, we're not kicking up dirt on him. We just don't have the resources, or we don't have the time, or we have our own families, or we have our own responsibilities, or we wouldn't even know where to begin or how to help this person. We just can't do it. We can't be inconvenienced by the cost of helping this man, right? And so we don't help him. That's more or less the situation here of Ruth and Naomi. Nobody's kicking them in their destitution, but in order to help them, in order to redeem them, it was insanely costly, inconvenient, burdensome, it required immense sacrifice, and, well, who will pay that price? This other man, the closer redeemer, the author calls him Poloni Almoni. It's a really funny, it sounds like an Italian put-down. Poloni Almoni, the author calls him. It's a weird-sounding name, but it basically means somebody, in Hebrew, whose identity is not worth revealing, whose identity will not be disclosed. Some translate this phrase, this name, as Mr. So-and-so, because that's actually the idea that the author is conveying here. This entire scene at the close of the book mirrors the scene at the beginning of the book in chapter one, where Ruth and Orpah, the two widow daughters-in-law of Naomi, are both on the road to Bethlehem with Naomi when Naomi sends them back to their homes, to their families in Moab, and Orpah, remember, dutifully returns. She honors her mother-in-law's request, whereas Ruth just clings on to Naomi. This man here, Mr. So-and-so, was probably a good man. What he offers to do here is actually a kind thing to do. It really was something that cared for the poor, but it did not require hesed. Loving, covenantal, God-like loyalty, sacrificial love, above and beyond love, hard love, costly love, and the moment that it did, he pressed the eject button. The moment he learned of Ruth, he backed out of the deal, and thus his name is not recorded in the Bible, for he plays no part in God's story of redemption. Like Orpah, like so many in this world, maybe some of you here this morning, he chose the easy path, perhaps at the cost of his own soul. Boaz was a more distant relative. Boaz was not Elimelech's brother. The Leveret Laws, even the Kinsman-Redeemer Laws, they don't obviously clearly apply to him. He's free in that sense, but Boaz was willing to pay the price. He's a strange man, Boaz, as we've observed throughout the book. He's a man with God's laws written upon his heart, even in the dark days of the judges, and so God's commands have become for him joy. Duty to his God has become his delight, and yes, as we will see, he too, like Ruth, though in a different way, forms a shadow of the Lord Jesus, our great Redeemer. Secondly, I want us to take one last look at Ruth, the title character. I want us to take one last look at Ruth. We learn in verse 11 that a crowd of townspeople have gathered around the city gate where this negotiation has unfolded, and once the redemption has been secured, the crowd erupts into a chorus of blessing, and I want you to see, it's a remarkable blessing. Look at verse 11. Then all the people who were at the gate and the elders said, we are witnesses. May the Lord make, here's the blessing, may the Lord make the woman who is coming into your house like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. May you act worthily in Ephrathah and be renowned in Bethlehem, and may your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah because of the offspring that the Lord will give you by this young woman. I want you to notice this remarkable blessing. It reaches back into Israel's history. Look carefully at the words here. It reaches all the way back to Rachel and Leah. Do you remember Jacob and the wild story of Rachel and Leah? We haven't quite gotten there in Genesis. We'll be there soon in the new year, but do you remember that story of Rachel, the wife who Jacob wanted, but who was tricked out of having, and then when he finally did get her, she was barren. And then the other wife, the sister Leah, the one he didn't really want, but who he got and who kept bearing him children. And Jacob, who through all that wrestled with God and thus afterwards was renamed Israel. Well, through that strange but remarkable family, the nation of Israel came forth. These sisters, Rachel and Leah, were the mothers of Israel. And now Ruth, the Moabite? It reaches back as well, notice, to Judah and Tamar. You remember that scandalous story we re-encountered last week. Judah, the man who neglected his daughter-in-law, Tamar, after she became a childless widow herself. Tamar, who then disguised herself as a prostitute and tricked her father-in-law on the path purposefully, the child of that scandal, Perez, continuing remarkably the line of the promised Messiah, the line of the Messiah here. And now Ruth, the Moabite? Now Boaz, a son of Judah, and that scandal. Now Boaz has found his way into the wild story of redemption and into the coming of the Messiah. And so is Ruth, the Gentile, even worse, the Moabite. And I'm gonna say a lot more about that tonight. The narrator transitions from this blessing really abruptly from city gate to wedding bells and then even more abruptly to birth announcement. Look at verse 13. So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife and he went into her and the Lord gave her a conception and she bore a son. They got married just like that. They got pregnant just like that. This is only the second time, mind you, in the entire book of Ruth that any action is ascribed to God when we read that the Lord gave her a conception. In chapter one, the Lord visited Israel, we read, thus ending the famine. And here in chapter four at the end, the Lord visited Ruth and gave her a child. You might've missed it, but Ruth was not just evidently a widow. She was also, it seems, barren. She was married, remember, to Malon for 10 years in Moab, but she never had child. So she was likely barren until now when the Lord opened her womb, just like Sarah and Abraham, just like Rachel. In the book of Esther, God is never mentioned. Not once does God appear by name or by any action ascribed to him in the entire book of Esther. Ruth is only slightly better. God never speaks in the entire book, and only two actions throughout the entire book are ascribed to God. For all the other details in the book, God is somewhere off in the background, silent, invisible. All the events in the book convey randomness and really remarkable, sheer, dumb luck. And there's something about this which is so important for us to understand, so important for you to understand. We all want, you all want God to shout at you or at least to whisper to you and remind you that he's there and that he really does care and that he really does see you and that he really does have his finger upon your life. We wanna know that he sees us and that he cares for us, but so often we don't. Sure, we have a few mountaintop experiences with him if we walk with him for long enough, maybe when we first believe, maybe in a moment of desperate need or of suffering. Maybe he really does for you at different points in your life so strongly impress upon you his word, his will upon your heart that you really feel like he's personally spoken to you. But for most of us and for most of our lives, he remains somewhere off in the background, mostly silent through all the randomness of our lives. This is another great lesson from the remarkable book of Ruth. God is the author of accidents and God is the ruler of the random in our lives. His finger has not slipped from the controls of history and that surely includes your life. Even when he feels silent or off in the background, maybe especially when he feels silent or off in the background, God is a minor background character in the book of Ruth, but if you understand the story, he's the lead actor of everything on his pages. We don't know what Ruth looked like when she's depicted in art or movies or whatever. She's always beautiful with long flowing black hair. That's entirely our romantic imagination getting the best of us. The book never comments on Ruth's physical appearance. Maybe she was beautiful in the book of Ruth, maybe she was beautiful, maybe she wasn't, we have no idea. The book only comments on her inner beauty and especially shows us how that inner beauty shined out of her in repeated acts of remarkable love, of chesed. We live in a culture today where one of the main sermons preached to us every day, all day by everybody is the importance of loving ourselves. We hear all the time, before you can learn to love anybody else, you have to first learn to love yourself, right? Amen, it preaches. You gotta love yourself. At no point of the book of Ruth do we get any insight whatsoever into what Ruth wanted for Ruth. Unless you think I'm making a point here specifically aimed or the Bible is making a point here specifically aimed at women, the exact same could be said for Boaz. Everything Ruth does in the entire book is for Naomi. Everything Boaz does in the entire book is for Ruth and Naomi. Their names are remembered. They are famous in history. This is one of the most remarkable, famous stories ever told and their names are remembered because they lived lives in love and in service to others. There's remarkable freedom in forgetting ourselves and in love to God, living lives of service to others. Just like Ruth, just like Boaz. Back in chapter one, you remember Naomi returned to Bethlehem declaring herself empty. She renames herself. She was Ruth, which means pleasant or sweet. She renames herself Mara, which means bitter. And I commented way back then. She came back, she says, I'm empty. I have nothing. I commented way back in chapter one that she was quite obviously wrong because she had with her, literally hanging onto her legs, Ruth. Now, just three chapters later, just look at all that she had indeed in this remarkable young woman. In verse 15, the women of the town remind Naomi what she had just in case she still did not grasp it. Look at verse 15, for your daughter-in-law. Remember, this is a patriarchal society. A son is everything. Legally, financially, a son is everything. For your daughter-in-law who loves you, who is more to you than seven sons, has given birth to him. What a remarkable young Moabite woman Ruth was. And finally, I wanna take just one last look at Naomi, especially in verses 14 to 17. We can't leave the book without one last look at Naomi. The book begins and the book ends with Naomi. Actually, you can make a really great case that the book, though it's entitled after Ruth and it records the story of Ruth, you can make a really great case that the book is actually about Naomi. It's the book of Naomi and Ruth, but it's really what Ruth is doing for and what God is doing in Naomi. The story revolves around the life and trials of Naomi. She's, as I've said before, she's the most complicated character in the entire book. She's also, as I've said many times through these few weeks, she's also the most relatable character in the book. Ruth is a powerful picture of hesed. She seems utterly selfless. Boaz is the consummate male strong hero, kind, strong, loyal, sacrificial, resourceful. You women, you young girls are right to aspire to be like Ruth in this book. You men, you young men are right to aspire to be like Boaz in your life and to pray that God would help you to become more like Boaz, but if we're honest, all of us, man or woman, much more easily identify with Naomi. Rather than waiting upon God, we make brash and foolish plans the moment things get hard. We forget God when things are good. We blame God when things are bad. We lose more than we win. We all suffer as life marches on. And bitterness for all of us is right around the corner. It's just a matter and a question of how much loss it will take to get us to break like Naomi broke. The narrator concludes his remarkable story not with Ruth or Boaz and their happy home, but with Naomi. In chapter one, when Naomi showed back up to Bethlehem, 10 years later, 10 years older, 10 years grayer, the town was all stirred and we read that the women said, is this Naomi? Gasp. She replied, don't call me that anymore. Call me Mara for my name is bitter. Here in chapter four, the women appear again on the scene. This time they gasp once more at what God has done with her. Look at verse 14. Then the women said to Naomi, blessed be the Lord, who has not left you this day without a redeemer. And may his name be renowned in Israel. He shall be to you a restorer of life, he shall be to you a restorer of life and a nourisher of your old age. For your daughter-in-law who loves you, who is more to you than seven sons, has given birth to him. What a remarkable turnaround. From these women and their words, what a remarkable turnaround for Naomi. The he there in those words, who's the he? It's the newborn son of Ruth and Boaz. He shall be a redeemer for Naomi. Think about that. He, the son, this newborn son, will preserve Naomi's name and her line. And when he grows up, he will care for and provide for Naomi as long as she lives. And so we read of him, he restores her life. He will, what an image, a restorer of life. This child will be to his grandmother. And he will nourish her in her old age. If you pay careful attention to this final chapter, it's a chapter all about redemption and redeemers. There are actually four redeemers in the chapter. Did you notice that? Where's Waldo? Can you spot them all? All four redeemers? There's Mr. So-and-so, Poloni Almani, the failed redeemer. Of course, there's Boaz, the worthy redeemer. There's this newborn child who will preserve Naomi's line and inheritance in the land, the child redeemer. And then there's a fourth surprise redeemer, but you'll have to come back tonight to hear more about him. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. I don't know what that was. The final scene of the book, the final scene of the book is Naomi as an older woman with a newborn son in her lap. She becomes his nurse. The journey we've been on, the journey she's been on, you have to enter into this scene. She becomes his nurse. The women of the neighborhood name him, proclaiming in verse 17, look at this, a son has been born to Naomi. It's Ruth's child. Ruth raises the child. Don't misunderstand this. But the narrator leaves you with a picture of a child being given by God to Naomi. So weird, why? Naomi once had a son, two in fact. She was a very blessed woman. She testified herself that she was once a fool woman. She buried both sons in Moab along with her husband. In chapter one, verse five, we read of her two lads is the word, you could literally translate it. She had two lads and she buried them both in Moab. She afterwards declared that she was empty and she became very bitter, bitter at life, bitter at life's hardships, bitter ultimately at God. She cried until she had no tears left to cry. She renamed herself bitter. She was empty entirely minus one thing, that daughter-in-law she just could not get rid of. But then there was harvest and then there was a relative and then Ruth happened upon that relative. And then the relative favored Ruth, showing her grace. And then Ruth came home one night after gleaning in the fields with an ephah of barley for Naomi. And then Ruth risked everything in the night proposing to Boaz and calling upon him to redeem her and to redeem Naomi. And then Ruth came home again after one night again after another night with even more barley for Naomi. And then that man, that worthy man, he did it. He redeemed both of them at the city gate. And then they married and then they had a child, a son no less. And here he was, here he is in Naomi's lap. In chapter four, verse 16, we read that there's a lad in her lap. It's the same word as the two in chapter one, verse five, who she buried, filled. The book of Ruth is a story of Naomi and Naomi's reversal from empty to filled all through the loving loyalty, the chesed of her remarkable daughter-in-law and the worthy man she happened upon. All under the direction of the invisible God off in the background writing storybook endings with a smile on his face. Maybe you're here this morning and in one way or a hundred feeling empty. Empty from loss like Naomi, some stinging pain or disappointment in your past, empty from rejection from a spouse or a friend or your own family members, empty from just feeling unnoticed or invisible to everybody around you. Maybe you're feeling empty after trying so hard and working so hard for so long to find approval from your dad or from other people or from God himself, and you still don't know if it's enough. Maybe you somehow here this morning feel empty in spite of having everything you thought you ever wanted. Sometimes it takes actually getting what we live for to realize how vain it was to put all of our hopes in that thing, money, position, power, the perfect family. Emptiness is a part of our shared human condition. It's a byproduct of our being estranged from God. We were made by him, we were made for him so that he and only he can satisfy us. And the consequence of our sin, the Bible is clear from its first pages, is that we've lost him. We've been cut off from access to him. This is the penalty for our sins, estrangement, death, emptiness. It's why your deepest longings can never be satisfied by enough food, by money, by fame, by popularity, even by friends in the perfect family. It's why there are those big why questions in the first place that this world can just never satisfactorily answer. Why am I here? What is the purpose of all this in my life and my longings and what does it all mean? Science can give you so much of what and even how, it can never touch why. Why? Why you? Why here? Why now? The only escape from emptiness is to return to what we rejected and to return to what we lost and to find our way back to God. And the Bible teaches that the only way back to God, the only way, is through his son, Jesus Christ. The book of Ruth is a book about famine and food. The book of Ruth is a book about God's providence in dark days and over random events. The book of Ruth is a book about God's caring for the poor and the destitute and the widow. The book of Ruth is about Gentiles remarkably finding their way into the people of God. The book of Ruth is about the power of love, the power, the earth-shattering power of chesed. But maybe more than anything else, the book of Ruth is a book about redemption. Unlikely redemption, costly redemption, full redemption, the word redemption or redeemer, it's goel, it's spelled the same as pursuant in Julian, goel, it's so easy to remember. The word redemption, redeemer, goel, goel, it appears 23 times in Leviticus 25, the chapter in the Bible with all those laws about kinsmen redeemers. The same word, goel, appears 23 times in the entire book of Ruth. It's a book about redemption and it's a book about the price of redemption. And this is what my friends, Ruth, especially has to offer us and to offer you this Christmas Eve. We were all lost in our sins, all dead in our sins, all enslaved, the Bible testifies, to sin and to the devil. We were all held as prisoners by an awful master by our own doing and headed for a sure and eternal punishment. No man could pay the price, not even a worthy man like Boaz could pay the price of our redemptions, could pay the price for our sins. No one was worthy and so God had to pay it himself. And so God became flesh. No other God would do such a thing, no other God would write such a ridiculous story and it would be ridiculous were it not true. So God did it, God became man and a child was born and of all places, a child was born in Bethlehem, the city of Naomi, the city of Boaz and now the city of Ruth. The price for our redemption was not money or land. If it were, some rich benefactor could pay it. It was nothing else that we could possibly drum up. The price for our redemption was blood, death. For the wages of sin is death, Paul writes. Of all the wonders in all the world, anywhere you could go into all the world and even reaching back into all the history of the world, there are two great wonders in all the world which far surpass the rest. First, that God should become a man. That God would actually coo and cry in a manger as a baby. And second, that God should die. The Muslims still say it's offensive and cannot be anything but blasphemy. That God would actually suffer and bleed and expire on a cross for our redemption, for our fullness, for any who would believe and give their lives to Christ. God, thank you for Christmas and thank you for Easter. Thank you for Christ, thank you for his life, his presence here among us, Emmanuel. Thank you for his death, paying our ransom to redeem us from the prison in which we found ourselves, to our own sin, to Satan, to death. God, we ask that you would set further prisoners free, even now this morning and this Christmas by granting by your spirit, faith, to trust in Christ and to surrender lives to Christ. It's in his name we pray, amen.
