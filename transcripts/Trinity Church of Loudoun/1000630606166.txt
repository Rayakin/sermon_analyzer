Good morning, family. Genesis 26, God's promise to Isaac. Now there was a famine in the land, besides the former famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Gerar to Abimelech, king of the Philistines. And the Lord appeared to him and he said, do not go down to Egypt. Fall in the land of which I shall tell you, sojourn in this land and I will be with you and will bless you for to you and to your offspring, I will give all these lands and I will establish the oath that I swore to Abraham, your father. I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and will give to your offspring all these lands. And in your offspring, all the nations of the earth shall be blessed because Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes and my laws. So Isaac settled in Gerar and when the men of the place asked him about his wife, he said, she's my sister for he feared to say my wife thinking less the men of the place should kill me because of Rebecca, because she was attractive in appearance. And when he had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out of a window and saw Isaac laughing with Rebecca, his wife. So Abimelech called Isaac and he said, behold, she's your wife. How then could you say she's my sister? Isaac said to him, because I thought lest I die because of her, Abimelech said, what is this you've done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife and you would have brought guilt upon us. So Abimelech warned all the people saying, whoever touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death. And Isaac sowed in that land and reaped in the same year, a hundred fold, the Lord blessed him and the man became rich and gained more and more until he became very wealthy. He had possessions of flocks and herds and many servants so that the Philistines envied him. Now the Philistines had stopped and filled the filled with earth, all the wells that his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham, his father. And Abimelech said to Isaac, go away from us for you are much mightier than we. So Isaac departed from there and encamped in the Valley of Gerar and settled there. And Isaac dug again, the wells of water that had been dug in the days of Abraham, his father, which the Philistines had stopped after the death of Abraham. And he gave them the names that his father had given them. But when Isaac's servants dug in the Valley and found there were a well of spring water, the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac's herdsmen saying, this water is ours. So he called the name of the well, Essek, because they contended with him. Then they dug another well and they quarreled over that also. So he called its name, Sitna. And he moved from there and dug another well and they did not quarrel over it. So he called its name, Rehoboth, saying, for now the Lord has made room for us and we shall be fruitful in the land. From there he went up to Beersheba and the Lord appeared to him that same night and said, I am the God of Abraham, your father. Fear not, for I am with you and will bless you and multiply your offspring for my servant Abraham's sake. So he built an altar there and he called upon the name of the Lord and pitched his tent there and there Isaac's servants dug a well. When Abimelech went to him from Gerar with Ahuzeth, his advisor, and Phicol, the commander of his army, Isaac said to them, why have you come to me seeing that you hate me and you've sent me away from you? They said, we see plainly that the Lord has been with you. So we said, let there be a sworn pact between us, between you and us, and let us make a covenant with you so that you will do us no harm, just as we have not touched you and have done to you nothing but good and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed of the Lord. So he made them a feast and they ate and drank in the morning. They rose early and exchanged oaths and Isaac sent them on their way and they departed from him in peace. That same day, Isaac's servants came and told him about the well that they had dug and said to him, we have found water. He called it Sheba, therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day. When Esau was 40 years old, he took Judith, the daughter of Beeri, the Hittite, to be his wife and Bethsebeth, the daughter of Elon, the Hittite, and they made life bitter for Isaac and Rebecca. This is the word of God. In 1960, Pete Best was an aspiring young drummer, 18 years old in Liverpool. The young manager of a new and forming, still forming, band auditioned Best to be their drummer and he got the gig. There were no other candidates. In August of 1960, Best left with the band to play shows in Germany and for two years, the foursome, the new foursome, toured to moderate success. And then in 1962, the band hired a new manager who felt Best was inadequate as a drummer and convinced the other three original members of the band to replace him. And so they did. Best was 20 years old now, scorned and jobless. Some say it was because Best was a lousy drummer. Others say it was because Best was the best looking of the four and the most popular with the girls and so the other three were jealous. That's what Best says, believe it or not. Anyway, after that, the band replaced Best with a new drummer and they sort of took off and they became pretty successful. The new drummer's name was Ringo Starr. The other three members of the band were John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison. Their band was called The Beatles and they're still regarded today as the most popular band of all time. As for Best, he did music for a little while longer before taking a job loading bread onto a delivery truck and eventually settling into a career and a quiet life as a recruiter for a job center in Liverpool. This morning, the author of Genesis, if you're not in Genesis 26, you can go ahead and turn there. The author of Genesis takes us in the story back in time from last week's story. Last week was the story of Jacob and Esau and their birth and the passing of the birthright. The next chapter, chapter 27, you can see goes right back to Jacob and Esau again and which of them is going to get their father's blessing and yet now in chapter 26, between those two stories, Moses goes back in time and pans the camera over to Isaac, their father. Isaac isn't nearly the star in Genesis as those who come before him and as those who come after him. Isaac's chapter in Genesis, we're actually in it now, it began in 2519. Remember those chapter titles in Genesis begin, these are the generations of, that marks a new passage, that's Moses, the author of Genesis, that's his way of beginning a new chapter title. Isaac's chapter, we're in it, begins in 2519, the generation of Isaac, Abraham's son. You see, Abraham fathered Isaac. Even his chapter, even the title of his chapter betrays that the chapter's kind of not really all that much about him. Isaac's father is father Abraham, inheritor of the promises and the friend of God. Isaac's son is Jacob, who will later become Israel, the father of the people of Israel who wrestled with God. Isaac is most famous for who his father is and who his son is. As for his own life, his most famous accomplishment in the Bible is, what would you say is Isaac's most famous accomplishment? I would say he has two. First, his being born in his mother's 99th year. And his other famous accomplishment, his being offered up as a sacrifice sometime after that. In other words, both of his great keystone accomplishments in life aren't really about him at all. He's just a passive instrument in the story. Even the few stories we have about Isaac aren't really about Isaac. His finding Rebecca, remember that story, all the wells and the, who's that story about? It's about Isaac's servant, maybe Eleazar of Damascus, and it's about Rachel's family, or Rebecca's rather, family. Isaac is just there at the end, praying or meditating in a field when the servant shows up with a bride, or the birth of his twin boys last week. Isaac's mentioned once in the whole affair as off in the background praying for his barren wife and suffering wife. In the story of Genesis, Isaac is not a leading actor, and he's not even really a supporting actor. He's more of a prop, overshadowed by his famous father, and then once more by his still famous son. Maybe that's you this morning, no offense, overshadowed, overlooked. Ever feel like you're a prop in somebody else's show? The fact is, though nobody ever really says it out loud, that's most of us, isn't it? Most of us live our lives in the background, so to speak. We work, and we work for others. We watch shows about others. We read stories and books about others. We talk about, over the dinner table, over lunch, when we want to gossip, we don't talk about ourselves a lot of times, we talk about others, because who would be interested in us? We live, in many ways, through others. We, ourselves, get one day per year our birthday, and that's why it's so special, because it's our one day. And then for the rest of our lives, we get two more days, which are really about us. Our weddings, if we get married, and then our funerals, where everybody finally expresses how wonderful we really were when we're not there to hear it. Genesis 26 is Isaac's chapter, and even still, I want to show you, it's kind of a chapter, it's kind of a chapter about Isaac's father, Abraham. So let's tune in now. I want to show you how Moses' point here is to show you how Isaac walked in the footsteps of his famous father, Abraham. And actually, why that is great news for Isaac, and why that's great news for you and me, this morning. So I'll show you this in three ways. First, I'll show you the footsteps of the father. Secondly, I'll show you the sins of the father. And finally, I'll show you the promises of the father, as Isaac just relives and walks in the path, as it were, the footprints, as it were, of his famous father, Abraham. So first, let's look at the footsteps of the father. Let's look at 26, verse 1, where we read that now there was a famine, Moses says, in the land, besides the former famine that was in the days of Abraham. Beginning in this way, the author immediately alerts you that everything here that you're about to read has all happened before, and that history is, in fact, repeating itself. In fact, almost everything that happens in Genesis 26 to Isaac has already happened to Isaac's father, Abraham. That's why I say this chapter is kind of still about Abraham, even though he's dead. And that's exactly the point that the author of Genesis is driving home. History is repeating itself. Isaac is walking in Abraham's footsteps. Notice, there's another famine. There's another sojourn south to escape the famine. Back in chapter 12, verse 10, we read, you don't have to turn there, but now Moses says there was a famine in the land. And so Abram, soon to become Abraham, went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land. And here we arrive in chapter 26. There's another famine in the land, and Abraham's boy, Isaac, also heads south to sojourn. There's another Abimelech. I wonder if you notice that name or recognize that name. There's another Abimelech, king of Gerar, another Phicol, the commander of his armies. There's another treaty struck between Abraham or Isaac and those powerful officials. Back in chapter 20 of Genesis, Abraham heads south, settles in Gerar, interacts with Abimelech, the king of Gerar. The next chapter, Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, come to Abraham seeking a treaty. Once they realize how blessed and powerful Abraham is, now Isaac, in this chapter, encounters, well, characters bearing the same name. These may just be titles. Abimelech means my father is king. Phicol could just be a military title. Or given lifespans in Genesis, they may indeed be the same individuals. Either way, Moses is painting the picture so that you see that history is repeating itself. There are more wells that are dug here in Genesis 26. Abraham had dug a well in Beersheba, back in chapter 21, cut a covenant there. Isaac re-digs the same well here, which the Philistines had filled with dirt. How petty can you be? There's more wealth here, 13 verse 2, Abraham, we read, was very rich in livestock, in silver and in gold. Here in 26.12, we read that, and Isaac sowed in that land and reaped in the same year a hundredfold. The Lord blessed him, and the man Isaac became rich and gained more and more and more until he became very wealthy, just like Papa. And then there are more problems caused by his wealth. More money, more problems. Abraham and his nephew Lot, you remember, they both became so rich that the land couldn't support them both. And so they separated from each other, and Lot ends up settling in the area of Sodom and Gomorrah. Well, here, look at 26.14, Isaac had possessions of flocks and herds and many servants so that the Philistines envied him. And then in verse 16, Abimelech said to Isaac, get away from us, for you are much mightier than we are. And so Isaac, we read, departed from there and encamped in the valley of Gerar and settled there. More money, more problems. History is just entirely repeating itself. It's all over the entire chapter. Isaac really is a chip off the old block. The acorn really hasn't fallen that far from the tree. And whatever other sayings about sons resembling fathers are out there, all true. Isaac is Abraham's son. And why does that matter to Moses, and why should that matter to you? History is repeating itself, Moses wants you to see, but that's not the main point he's driving home. So secondly, look with me, let me show you the sins of the father, how Isaac walks in the footsteps of his father, not just incidentally, not just circumstantially, but also he walks in the same patterns of sin, first tread by Abraham. There are two obvious sins recorded in chapter 26, both committed by Isaac. Both of them, would you believe it, the same sins committed by Abraham earlier in Genesis. What were the two sins? The first sin Isaac commits here is his fleeing the promised land. Verse one, now there was a famine in the land besides the former famine that was in the days of Abraham, and Isaac went to Gerar, to Abimelech, the king of the Philistines. This is so critical. Isaac, you have to remember, where is Isaac when this story begins, when this famine comes? Isaac is in the promised land. He's in the land that was promised to Abraham as part of his blessing, part of the covenant God made with Abraham. That land is now Isaac's. This land, God has promised to bless and to bless Isaac in, just like Abraham, Isaac should have stayed right where he was and prayed and waited upon God to provide for him. Did he think that God brought him to the promised land just so that he could starve to death? Of course not. What about the promises? By the way, everything I just said, I literally copied and pasted from my sermon on Genesis 12 months ago and just replaced Abraham with Isaac because it's the exact same point. Just like Abraham before him, Isaac fled south. He stops in Gerar, which is just south of the promised land. It's at the southern border outside of the promised land, but there's no doubt where Isaac is headed as he goes south. Verse two confirms it. We read, and the Lord appeared to him and said, do not go down to Egypt. Dwell in the land which I shall tell you. Where's Isaac going? He's going to Egypt. Egypt in Genesis represents the world. Just like Rome in Jesus' day, just like Babylon in the book of Revelation. In Genesis, Egypt represents the world, the safety and security and comfort and entertainment and pleasure and money and everything the world has to offer. In Genesis, that's Egypt. He's headed for Egypt. He's headed for the security of the Nile River, just like Abraham before him. There's always food. There's always water where the Nile runs. How many times when circumstances change, when life pinches, when relationships become a little complicated, when money is a little tight, how many times do you and I just immediately flee? We pray and we seek and we ask like we believe in a God who rules over the universe until the moment things get hard and now we've got to take this over. We've got to do this because this is now in our hands. How many times? We change jobs. We change friends. We change churches. We might even move towns just to escape it all. And don't get me wrong. I want to be clear. There is a time and a season for all those things. Sometimes fleeing and sometimes a fresh start is the best move, but I'm just asking, what do we miss when we get so used to fleeing so quickly all the time, every instance that things, that moments gets hard? I've said this so many times, but I'm just so convinced that in churches and specifically in conflict within churches, I'm so convinced that there may so often be, and there is so often spirit produced gold in friendships, in relationships, in your and my own holiness, personal sanctification, in community. I don't mean the cheap way we always toss that word around. I mean, biblical community gathered around the people, the word of God, the people of God. There may so often be spirit produced gold that can only be found on the other side of conflict, but which most of us will never, ever, ever see or reach because we all just live in a culture where the second things get awkward, we all flee. For instance, covenant we make those of you who are members of this church, the covenant we make in membership is not about liking this church more than the rest of the churches out there, liking it enough to give it a little bit of your money. It's not about, well, this church actually hasn't offended me yet, so I'll join that church. It's about committing to a people. And that means committing to a people who sin and need your forgiveness. And that means committing to a people who fall down and who need your patience. And it means committing to a people who are just, if we're honest, not where we should be by now. People in other words, just like us. What might Isaac have seen from God and learn from God, receive from God had he only in verse one and verse two, live by faith and not by his eyes and not by the growl of his stomach. The second sin Isaac commits here in Genesis 26 is even more obvious as Isaac lies about his wife claiming she was his sister. In verse six, we read, so Isaac settled in Gerar. Now that's exactly what God told him to do. That's Isaac obeying. And yet the next verse, watch how quickly this turns. Verse seven, when the men of the place asked him, asked Isaac about his wife, he said, she's my sister. For he feared to say, my wife, thinking lest the men of this place should kill me because of Rebecca, because she was attractive in appearance. My, oh my, did this family of men and father and son have good taste in women? I know that's so awkward and feels inappropriate to say, but Moses is the one saying it. Abraham and Isaac's wives were both stunning and they both knew it. And so when Isaac settled in Gerar in a strange land with strangers all around, Isaac became paranoid. Just like Abraham became paranoid in Egypt with Sarah, his beautiful wife, and Isaac, just like Abraham cooked up a lie and a scheme, he'd call Rebecca his sister. That's a brilliant trick. Where'd he learn that brilliant trick? Chapter 12, verse 11, when Abram was about to enter Egypt, he said to Sarah, his wife, I know that you're a woman, beautiful in appearance so far, so good, always nice to compliment your wife. But when the Egyptians see you, they will say, this is, this is his wife. Then they will kill me, but they will let you live. Say you are my sister instead, that it may go well with me because of you and that my life may be spared for your sake. God spares him and her in spite of Abraham's foolishness. And then in chapter 20, if you remember when Abraham flees again and settles in Gerar, he does the same thing again. And now here in chapter 26, we have his son, Isaac, pulling the same stunt. And so verse eight says, when Isaac had been there a long time, a long time claiming his wife as his sister, Abimelech, the king of the Philistines, looked out of a window and saw Isaac laughing with Rebecca. So one night, Abimelech sees the two of them, brother and sister, supposedly, and he sees them giggling. It's interesting to know, by the way, in chapter 20, Sarah is taken in, Abraham's wife is taken in by Abimelech. But God, you remember, comes to Abimelech in a dream and warns judgment. Here Abimelech isn't warned by God. Here Abimelech is looking out his window and he sees the two of them laughing. The word here is suggestive, it's clear Hebrew innuendo. They were showing intimacy to one another. I would like to present it to you as steamy laughter, which I almost just impersonated and I'm so glad that the Spirit screened that at the very last second. I don't even know where I was gonna go. I just started thinking of different ways to, Abimelech is, Abimelech is morally outraged and so he immediately calls out to Isaac and confronts him in verse nine. Why did you say she was your sister? I saw the two of you laughing last night. Oh man, what a moment. If I could draw out a number of lessons from this fascinating, it'd be hilarious if it weren't so sad and twisted. If I could draw out a number of lessons for you from this fascinating story of Isaac returning to his father's sins, four lessons I want to draw out for you from here. First, father's sins tend to show up in their children. And of course I'm saying fathers here because Abraham is the father and that's what we have here in this example, but the same is obviously true for mothers and daughters or mothers and sons and fathers and daughters just as well. Father's sins tend to show up in their children. In the Ten Commandments, Moses receives from the Lord the legal code, the Ten Commandments that Israel is to live by and in the middle of that we read, Exodus 20 verse 5, you shall not bow down to other gods or serve them for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God. And God reveals himself in this way, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who trust me, but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments. That's how God reveals himself as the one true God who alone is worthy of Moses and Israel and everyone else's worship. That's how he discloses his name. Of course, God is speaking there of judgment, visiting iniquity upon sons and grandsons and on and on. But part of God's judgment, part of the penalty for father's sins, I would suggest may often be those same sins taking root in the children. Children are learners, they unbelievably mimic and memorize, toddlers can memorize really complex songs just from riding in a car, all you mothers and fathers know this. And they see parents more than anybody else. That means they see parents' sins more than anyone else and patterns are thus created within families and even travel across generations. And so all of us are born with a handicap, so to speak, and we must overcome them even as we receive them from our parents. Patterns must be broken. If you study the kings of Israel later in the Bible, notice how many of the sons who replaced their fathers as kings just commit the same sins as their fathers. And every once in a while, the few good kings in that dark history, that dark portion of Israel's history, every once in a while there's a good king, how does he become a good king? Only one way, he must break the pattern, he must break the cycle. Children, if I could speak to you for a moment, you're supposed to learn from your parents. They are God's gifts to you to teach you, to show you what it's like to follow Jesus. But we're still sinners as parents. And that means we don't always ourselves follow Jesus perfectly. And so what that means for you is as you grow up, you want to follow us, parents, as we follow Jesus and not follow us in our mistakes. Second lesson I want to draw out for you from this recurring, repeating, sad episode, sometimes father's sins grow worse in children. Sometimes father's sins grow worse in children. I admit that I'm picking up and preaching a very, very, very minor detail here, but it's interesting. I wonder if you noticed, do you remember when Abraham concocted his lie about Sarah? Do you remember? It was technically kind of true. Sarah was Abram's half sister. She was in a sense, in a legal sense, she was his sister. And so he could easily, you can imagine, he can, he lays down his pillow at night. I know what I just did. He deceived, but he can easily assuage his conscience at night, but it was half true, right? Well, in Isaac, this is just an outright lie. There's no semblance of truth here whatsoever. There's no basis in reality. Rebecca bears no relation to him other than wife, period. And I think there's something to this. Sometimes our sins grow worse in our children and in those around us than even they were in us. David commits adultery with Bathsheba, Solomon, his son builds a harem for a thousand wives and concubines. An angry father, quietly stewing, displeased father can easily become a tyrant and abusive even son. Moms and dads, if I can speak to you and us for a moment, you can't help but to be watched by your kids. And so you're always modeling something. Make sure whatever else you're modeling, make sure that we're modeling repentance. Apologize regularly. That's not a sign of weakness. That's just reality. And it commends the gospel. Apologize regularly and model for your kids. We're fighting your sin and me fighting my sin because we're sinners. Our kids know that we're sinners. Do they know that we're fighting our sin as well? Third lesson I want to draw out, sin must be cut off and cut out at the root. Hear me carefully on this one. Can you detect, as you read this story, as you hear this story, can you detect any root, two sins of Isaac, can you detect? Did you detect in the story any root causes behind his two sins? Why does he flee and why does he lie? The same root, I would suggest, it's not that hard to find, the same root lies behind both sins. What's the same root? Fear. He doesn't trust God. It is always essential that you and I identify not just where we've sinned, but the root cause in our hearts that's causing our sin to fire in our bodies, in our speech, in our mouths, in our actions. Otherwise, what you're doing when you stop, all you're doing is slapping bandages on cancer. Covenant eyes. You know, you have trouble with a sin like lust, so you get covenant eyes on your computer. You get rid of the smartphone. You're serious about this. You get rid of the television. Maybe you should, but you still haven't gotten at the problem. The problem was not your television. The problem was not your phone. The problem is not your computer. The problem is the lust in your heart. See, that's the root, and I've got to get at the root and not just treat symptoms. We all do or will never see God's holiness in our life, conquering our sins. By the way, this is part of our job as church members to help each other to identify and cut at the root of our sins. Isaac's root, his Achilles heel, just like Abraham, his father's, is fear. The enemy of faith, of trusting in God, fear. Proverbs 29.5, the fear of man lays a snare, but whoever trusts in the Lord is safe. Let me flip it around. Whoever trusts in the Lord is safe, but the fear of man lays a snare. It is worth asking. It is worth your and my asking this morning because this is so common to man, so common to all of us. What are you afraid of? Is it loneliness or being alone? Is it loss of security or comfort? Is it sickness or pain or death? Is it just any form of suffering? Is it a lack of acceptance from your friends? Is it poverty? Kids, what are you most afraid of? More than anything else, what's the biggest thing that causes you to be most afraid? We're all afraid of something. And have you considered how your fears are a significant potential stumbling block for you for me? If unaddressed, at the root, those fears. If unaddressed, there's a good chance that those fears will spawn all kinds of sin and destruction in your life and relationship. How many lives and marriages and families and homes are just built around fear that has been accepted? And everybody's just accepted the miserable reality that we're going to live afraid lives, panic lives, because nobody's actually gotten after the root. Fourth lesson I want to draw from this little repeat episode of Isaac mimicking his father's sin. Fourth lesson, the world is always watching. The world is always watching. Isaac lied about his wife and Abimelech was watching. Verse 10, Abimelech said, what is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife and you would have heaped guilt upon us. Later in verse 28, verse 29, Abimelech and Phicol approach Isaac and watch what they say here. They say, we see plainly, we see, they're watching, we see plainly that the Lord has been with you. And so we said, let there be a sworn pact between us, between you and us, and let us make a covenant with you that you will do us no harm just as we have not touched you and have done to you nothing but good and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed of the Lord. Here's what I want you to see. When God was showing Isaac great favor and when Isaac was lying in both instances, Moses records that Abimelech was watching it all. The world is watching us when we honor God. The world notices when we're shown favor by God. The world is watching when we're hypocrites and say one thing but act another. So many people in this world, unbelieving persons, not Christians, so many of them have barricaded themselves from Christianity, from the God of Christianity, from the church, and they've buried, barricaded themselves, they've protected themselves with this. The church, you've heard it a hundred times, just like I have, the church is filled with hypocrites. Now that might be an excuse to cover up other reasons they don't want to go to church, don't want to have anything to do with God. It might be nothing more than a powerful antidote to conscience. But let me just call us to be mindful not to ourselves strengthen the power of that by our own actions and by our own hypocrisy. Isaac is repeating the same sins as his father Abraham. In Genesis 26, the chapter is stained by the sins of Isaac, but that's still not the main point that Moses is driving home. What is Moses arguing in this chapter of the Bible? Thirdly, finally, I want you to observe with me the promises of the father. There's something bigger than Isaac's sins in Genesis 26. In verse 2, we read that the Lord appeared to Isaac and then spoke to him. In verse 24, we read again that the Lord appeared to Isaac again. The Lord appeared to Isaac just like he appeared to Abraham before and spoke with Abraham face to face like a friend. Three times in the chapter, if you're looking for a chorus in Genesis 26 in this narrative, three times we read that the Lord was with Isaac. Verse 3, God promises, I will be with you and bless you, Isaac. Verse 24, God appears again and says again, I, Isaac, am the God of Abraham, your father. Fear not for I am with you and will bless you. Verse 28, Abimelech and Phicol, amazingly two unregenerate pagan officials say, we see plainly that the Lord has been with you. That's the chorus of Genesis 26. The Lord, the Lord will be with you, Isaac. God was with Isaac as he was with Abraham, Emmanuel. In verse 23, Isaac went up to Beersheba. That's the southern border now in the promised land. In chapter 21, Abraham went to the same place, Beersheba, and dug a well there and called it Beersheba. That's why it's called Beersheba. There Abraham then planted a tree and there we read in chapter 21 that Abraham called upon the name of the Lord, the everlasting God. In other words, he worshiped God in Beersheba. Now in our chapter, Isaac returns to Beersheba in verse 24 after his disobedience and the Lord meets him there. And so what does Isaac do? In verse 25, he built an altar and there he called upon the name of the Lord. He worshiped God there just like daddy Abraham and worshiped God there. And throughout the chapter, I wonder if you notice the covenant, the great promises of God made first with Abraham, Genesis 12, Genesis 15, Genesis 17, repeated again and again. This great covenant of God with Abraham throughout this chapter is renewed and repeated multiple times. Verse three, look at verse three. God says, I will be with you and I will bless you. For unto you and to your offspring, I will give all these lands and I will establish the oath that I swore to Abraham, your father. What is that? Where did that come from? That's Genesis 12. That's the Abrahamic covenant. Look at verse 24. And the Lord appeared to Isaac again the same night and said, I am the God of Abraham, your father. Fear not for I am with you and will bless you and multiply your offspring for my servant Abraham's sake. What is that? In Genesis 15, verse one, God came to Abraham in the night in a vision beneath a starry sky, the starlit sky. And he said, Abraham, fear not. I am your shield. Then he walked him out beneath the stars and told him to count them all if he could. And so shall your offspring be. What is happening here? Abraham was a scared man. Isaac is a scared man after him. God speaking directly to his fears and renewing these promises, just like God will speak directly to your fears if you'll hear him. God was with Isaac. Just like Abraham, God was with Isaac. So this is the point. So God's promises to Abraham have now traveled and transferred to Isaac. That's the point. That's the point. Moses is driving home in this chapter. The promises God made, those big glorious promises, people, place, blessing. They're all now coming to Isaac. Isaac sins in this chapter. They've been drowned out by the promises of God. This chapter should be about Isaac's fall. Like Cain earlier, or so many other characters, Adam. This should be a chapter about Isaac's fall. But by the mercies of God, it's a chapter about the promises of God and the grace of God now renewed to Isaac. The blessing is still alive. All the promises, all the hopes of Abraham are still alive, and they're alive in his totally unremarkable son, Isaac. That blessing that Isaac is about to pass on, therefore, in the next chapter to one of his sons, wait and find out who it is. That blessing, therefore, contains all the promises of God made to Abraham. Therefore, that blessing contains all the hope of salvation. Isaac, in the story of Genesis, is a really small figure. Abraham casts a towering shadow, and Isaac just sort of sits invisibly beneath it. We know everything about Isaac's scoundrel son, Jacob, as we're going to see in coming weeks. Moses gives us all kinds of detail. Moses gives very little detail whatsoever about Isaac. Maybe he was just a little too indistinct, too bland, too boring, and he just wasn't that good of a drummer. For the rest of Isaac's life, he'd just be known as Abraham's son, and later he'd be known as Jacob's dad. Most of us are not Abraham, or Sarah, or Jacob. Most of us, if we're anybody in this story, are Isaac, a blip on the radar, overshadowed by our fathers, or our sons, or our brothers, or our sister, or our friends, or most everybody around us, forgotten to history for our more famous band members. And yet, these really big, glorious promises came down to Isaac, and became his as he shared in his father's faith, as he worshipped Abraham's God. And my friends, that is true for you as well, and me as well, if you trust in Jesus. It doesn't matter if you're rich or if you're poor. It doesn't matter if you're important, if you're a somebody, or if very few people actually know your name. It doesn't matter if you have so many friends, and you're so busy that you can't possibly hang out because, oh my gosh, you're so busy, and you have too many friends, and you're busy every night, or if you're alone on Friday nights, wishing somebody would call you. It doesn't matter if you preach a sermon to thousands, and everybody afterwards wants to come and thank you, and ask you your opinions on the Bible, or if you sit in the back in the sound booth, or serving in the church's nursery so that others can hear the word. Even if you believe in Jesus, these really big promises are yours, and they're just as much yours as they are anybody else's. Nobody has more of these promises than you do if you trust in Jesus with the weakest faith. If you believe in Jesus, if you trust in him, and if you follow him as your king, that's what faith is, then when you die, you're going to be welcomed to paradise, and into the presence of God, where no names are forgotten, and where no characters are minor. And when you get there, somehow, you will not hear the story of your failures. Those are real. That is why Jesus had to die, to pay for them. But they'll have been drowned out by these big, glorious promises of God, just like Isaac's were, and by the blood of the lamb. Let's pray. Thank you so much for Isaac's, for Abraham's, who inspire awe and wonder in us, and for Isaac's, who are so much more relatable. And thank you so much that your mercy and your grace is not partial in that way. It doesn't pick and choose the best, it doesn't pick and choose the brightest, it doesn't pick and choose the richest, or anything like that. It is extended to any and all in Christ, and by faith in Christ. And so God, strengthen, we pray, this morning, our trust in these precious promises. Help us to live by them as your people. Help some to live by faith for the first time. Help us all to endure to the end, and we pray these things in Jesus' name, amen.
