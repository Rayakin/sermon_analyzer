Hebrews 3 1 through 6 The emperor Shah Jahan, emperor of what is now modern-day India, built what would eventually become one of the seven wonders of the world. This is the Taj Mahal. I'm sure we've all heard of this at one point or another. Most of us, at least through the many pictures that we've seen of the Taj Mahal, can envision the white marble and the reflecting pool in the front, the trees that line the pool, the white columns that sit at the corners, and, of course, the iconic pointed dome roof that sits atop the Taj Mahal. It's an incredible structure, and perhaps some of you have even perhaps been there and visited it. But what many people don't know is the story behind the Taj Mahal. It was this emperor, Shah Jahan, who built this as a memorial to his beloved wife. Her name was Mumtaz Mahal. And after Mumtaz died, giving birth to their 14th child, because of his great love for her, he resolved to build her a mausoleum that was as beautiful as she was, where they would forever house her remains. The Taj Mahal took around 22 years to complete, with the help of over 20,000 artisans that they used to transport the various materials back and forth. The Taj Mahal is a beautiful architectural masterpiece, and the story that undergirds it is one that demonstrates the timeless love of the builder for his beloved. If you have your Bibles today, you can turn to Hebrews 3. Hebrews 3. I'm glad to be here with you, sitting under the reading of God's Word. And as I've been preaching, we've been in the book of Hebrews, the book of Hebrews, towards the end. And a quick bit of context, as I've shared with you all, and even Pastor Matt hit a little bit last week, the book of Hebrews is written to a group of newly converted Jewish Christians. So this is a Jewish audience who are new converts to Christianity, and so the task for the author of Hebrews is to address this temptation that they have to adhere to the old covenant, to the old way of doing things, to the law, to the former Jewish sacrificial system. They've grown up in this. Their whole lives as Jews has been to strictly adhere to the law and Torah, the rituals, the festivals, to their ethnic heritage. And so the author of Hebrews is writing to exhort and to encourage his Jewish audience to see that Jesus is greater than all these things, that he's the fulfillment of all these things, and that the old covenant is actually giving way to a newer and better covenant in Christ. So as I preached through the previous sermons in Hebrews, I shared that one of the primary themes that we see in Hebrews is this, that Christ is supreme over all things. Christ is supreme over all things. That there's really four things that the author addresses in particular in Hebrews, four things in the first ten or so chapters, and they are this. These four things are these. Number one, Christ is supreme over angels. We talked about this last time I preached. Christ is supreme over Moses. This is where we're going to be headed for today. Christ is supreme over the Old Testament priesthood. And lastly, Christ is supreme over and fulfills the sacrificial system, the Old Testament sacrificial system. Christ is supreme over all things. Huge foundational concept to the book of Hebrews. And what I want us to do today is to now take that statement and actually expand on it just a little bit. So right now we're hanging out at 30,000 foot level. We'll zoom down to our text for today in just a second. But 30,000 feet, what we're going to begin to see more and more as we move throughout Hebrews is that the author wants his audience to see that Christ's supremacy has massive implications for believers and for his church. And the thing in particular that the author of Hebrews knows that he needs to begin injecting into these young believers is the importance of faith, the centrality of faith in Jesus as Lord over all things. They need to grasp the importance of persevering in faith, as Matt talked about last week, as more important than persevering in Torah and law following. And we as the church today, we need this same encouragement, the same reminder to persevere in our own faith. And so I want to add on to, build on to our high-level statement about the book of Hebrews today. And I want to expand our statement to this. Listen to this. Because Christ is supreme over all things, he strengthens his church to persevere in faith. Because Christ is supreme over all things, he strengthens his church to persevere in faith. And as we continue to move through Hebrews, we'll see how this statement acts as a guide for the rest of the letter and how the emphasis will increasingly pivot from the supremacy of Christ to now Jesus as the object, the founder, and the builder of our faith. Because Christ is supreme over all things, he strengthens his church to persevere in faith. That's 30,000 feet, fly over Hebrews. Now we're going to drop down to the 10,000-foot level for today as we look at Hebrews 3, 1-6. And this is our second point, our second point of how Jesus is supreme over all things. Namely, he is supreme, he is greater than Moses, as it might even say in the heading to some of your Bibles there in this chapter. And again, this is hard for the Jews, right? We don't mess with Moses. This was the guy Dave just read that other people, God reveals himself in dreams and visions, but Moses, he spoke to like a man, mouth to mouth. Moses is important, and yet Jesus is greater. So here's our roadmap for our text today. First, we're going to look at three reasons why Jesus is greater than Moses, why he is, to use the author's language, worthy of more glory than Moses, why this is important, why it's significant, why the author makes this argument, and these three points will help us to arrive at two final conclusions, two takeaways of application as we wrap up. So let's dive right in. Let's pick right up with verse 1 in chapter 3. Verse 1 says this, Therefore, holy brothers, you who share in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession. I love this language that the author uses right off the bat. He calls them holy brothers and implied they're his sisters as well. With a heavenly calling, holy brothers, he acknowledges that these young, new in the faith Jewish believers are holy and that they have a high and heavenly calling because they have professed faith in Christ. They've believed the gospel. They've been redeemed. We believe that, and the author leads off with this statement intentionally. In a similar vein, listen to how the apostle Peter uses similar language in 1 Peter 1 about the heavenly calling or the inheritance of those who place their faith in Christ. Verses 4 and 5, Peter says this. He says that all believers one day will obtain an inheritance which is imperishable, undefiled, will not fade away, and is kept in heaven for you. Notice the similarity there to Hebrews, right? Holy brothers and sisters with a heavenly calling, a heavenly inheritance. There's familial and yet lofty language that the author uses, and this is important. It's important that they understand their newfound state in Christ and how they now relate to God. The author's making a foundational statement of identity as he begins this section of scripture, right? He's saying here's who you are, brothers and sisters, with a high and heavenly calling right off the bat. It's an important foundation. And then he says this. He says consider Jesus. And here he gives Jesus these really loaded titles. He says apostle, high priest, all titles that would have been very familiar to the Jews, and yet, again, still a bit controversial to a Jewish person trying to still make sense of this new faith in Jesus as Lord and Jesus as being even greater than even Moses. So he's attaching to Jesus these high titles of apostle and high priest in a way to begin to acclimate them or ease them into these Jewish readers, into the argument that he's about to make about Christ's supremacy and his sufficiency. Apostle and high priest. Lastly in this verse, there's also confession language that we see, right? So Jesus, our apostle and high priest, he is also the foundation of our confession. So it all connects to bring a weightiness to the confession that these Christians have now made, specifically the one in whom they confess to believe. In our newcomer lunch a couple weeks ago, Pastor Matt taught on what a church is right out of Matthew 16. Famous passage where Jesus, speaking to the disciples, asks them, he says, who do you say that I am? Peter, of course, speaks up. He says, Jesus, you are the Christ, the son of the living God. To which Jesus then responds, yes, and upon this rock, Petras, Peter, I will build my church. Jesus is God, the apostle and the high priest of our confession, and he is building something. A lot of dense theology in this little verse. So in light of all this, the author is calling these new Jewish believers to consider something crucial, something foundational about Christ. What is that? It's that Jesus is, in fact, greater than Moses, and he's going to begin to unpack why this is in verse 2. He says, Jesus, who was faithful to him who appointed him, just as Moses also was faithful in all God's house. So this gets us to our first reason why Jesus is greater than Moses. Reason number one, Jesus is perfectly faithful to the Father. Jesus is perfectly faithful to the Father. The Father is, of course, the one who appointed Jesus to his ministry on earth, and the text makes it very clear that Jesus was faithful to him who appointed him. But the author also makes a comparison to Moses, who he says was also faithful over the house that God had given to him. We'll compare how Jesus and Moses are both faithful and what that dynamic looks like in just a second. But first, we see this term, house, here in verse 2. House, faithful in all God's house. The Greek word here, so the original language within which this is written for this word house is oikos. Oikos, yes, that's, you might recall pictures, commercials of John Stamos advertising the yogurt brand, oikos. The same word, I love this word, oikos. And here's what it means. Essentially it refers to a household or a family or a group of descendants. Oikos, it's a family, it's a group of people that the author tells us that Moses was faithful in, faithful to Stuart. Which as we read through the Exodus, we can see plainly that this household, this oikos, is the people of God. It's Israel, right? And then the author makes a comparison, keeps going, between Moses and Jesus' faithfulness to the Father, to the one who had appointed each of them to their respective ministries. And it's here when we consider the comparison that we really see Christ's holiness and his righteousness radiating because whereas Moses was generally faithful to Yahweh, Jesus was perfectly faithful. What do I mean by that? First, when we look at their callings. At the burning bush, Moses was called by the Lord to liberate the people of God, to be used by him as they were trapped in slavery in Egypt. And when God shares this with Moses, what does Moses say? He basically says no, right? He's hesitant. He didn't want to go. It took a lot of convincing and God-promising signs and wonders to help Moses to get a move on, and we would have all been the same. To get him to a place of answering this call and being a faithful steward, he was nervous about his speech, about what he would say. There was much fear and trepidation in Moses as he was called and appointed to his ministry. What about Jesus? Philippians 2 tells us this in verse 5. So this is how Jesus thinks. Think like this. He was willing to be grasped, but he emptied himself by willingly taking the form of a servant. Being born in the likeness of men and found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. Perfectly faithful. That's their calling. What about their work and their ministries? The people out of Egypt with the supernatural plagues, against Egypt, the parting of the Red Sea. Incredible. God using Moses to save this oikos from slavery. And yet Jesus is the only one who can lead us out of our deepest enslavement to sin. Jesus alone leads us out of bondage and into the freedom of his kingdom and the joy of his presence. Which, as Jesus reminds us in Matthew 9, when it comes to performing miracles versus forgiving sins, the latter is actually the greater feat, as Jesus tells the scribes. What about the people they dealt with? Moses, in the midst of wandering the desert, frustrated by the people of God, due to their grumbling and their complaining, as any of us would have been, Moses actually gets angry, and he sins. He gets mad, and because of his anger, he is consequently punished by Yahweh. He's actually banned from entering the Promised Land. He takes the people right up to the Jordan River, to Mount Nebo, and has to stop. Moses is faithful, and yet, like us, he's flawed. Jesus, on the other hand, regularly dealing with his own disciples, as you read through the Gospels, on belief, fear, competition between themselves, and even outright denial from Peter. How does Jesus respond to this? He says to Peter, in John 21, he says, Speaking to Peter, Jesus then commissions him to ministry, and he says, He truly is gentle and lowly, and yet perfectly faithful to the one who appointed him. Jesus is greater than Moses, because Jesus is perfectly faithful to the Father. Verse 3. It says, Our second reason why Jesus is greater than Moses is that, number two, Jesus is the faithful builder of his house. Jesus is the faithful builder of his house. You know, it would be a complete and utter tragedy if, when you visited the Taj Mahal, if all the tour guide talked about was how great the servants were, right? Who took care of the building, how they polished the marble so well, how they took care of the gardens outside, how they maintained the beautiful clarity of the reflecting pool. All that is great. Those are all great, beautiful, amazing things. And yet, to leave off the very reason for the building's existence, right? To fail, to extol and to celebrate the beautiful love story that literally laid the foundation of the structure would be a tragedy. And why is that? Because the glory of the servant pales in comparison to the glory of the builder of the house. Jesus is the builder of his house. And he's actively at work building and shaping his oikos for his glory. Now, Moses, though imperfect, was generally faithful as a servant over this house, as the text says. We just saw this again through the Exodus in Egypt, the Ten Commandments, wandering in the wilderness. Faithful, absolutely. But we have to understand, and this is important, that the very work that Moses did to shepherd, to care for, and to lead God's people to the land of promise. All of that work, as great as it was, actually foreshadows a greater future work over God's house. Moses' faithfulness as a steward anticipates and even acts as a stepping stone to the greater work that the builder of the house would one day carry out. This is the work of Jesus, talking about the church. Listen to 1 Peter 2, verse 4. Houses like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house. Holy priesthood, right? Now, because of what Jesus has done, Moses isn't the only priest. We now can all boldly approach the throne of grace through Jesus, as it says later on in Hebrews. To offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. Verse 9, right? You are a chosen race. A royal priesthood. A holy nation. A people for his own possession. Sounds a lot like our word, oikos. That you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. Once you were not a people, but now you are God's people. And he's writing to Jews and to Gentiles. See the continuity between the old and the new. Same redemptive work. Same gospel story. Moses was paving the way as a servant, as a steward for the work that the builder of the house, Jesus, would one day fully complete and fully establish as he would ransom a people unto himself by his very blood. This is why Jesus is worthy of more glory, more praise, more esteem, more honor. Jesus is greater than Moses because Jesus is the faithful builder of his house. Verse 4. Little parenthesis statement right here. And it says, for every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God. Seems like somewhat of an obvious parenthetical statement. Right, if you see a house somewhere, you can assume it was built by a builder. And then ultimately God who created everything is sovereign and the builder of all things. Thank you, author of Hebrews. But I think the author means to actually encourage the people that he's writing to. Remember, he's already called them brothers and sisters who share in a heavenly calling, verse 1. And so what he's going to do now is connect the dots between this house that Jesus is building to the people who are brothers and sisters who make up this house. This oikos, this group of descendants who have confessed Jesus to be the Christ. In other words, the church needs to see and be encouraged that Jesus is working in them. That they are the building. And that all who confess Jesus as Lord can rest assured that Christ will complete this work that Jesus began in them. And I wonder how many of us again today might need to hear this. Those of us who might be hurting, who are tired, who are wondering if God is still near and at work in our midst. If he's hearing our prayers, if God has forgotten us. The answer is yes, he does. He loves his body. And though we may not see it fully, he is at work in his church and in your life, Christian. Verses 5 and 6. We'll read the first part of 6, 6a. Now Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant to testify to the things that were to be spoken later. But Christ is faithful over God's house as a son, as a son. And the third reason that Jesus is greater than Moses is because Jesus is faithful as a son, as the son. The verse begins reiterating Moses' faithfulness as we've looked at as a servant. But then it makes this interesting statement at the end of verse 5. Look at this, that Moses' service, that it testifies to things that were to be spoken later. It testifies. What is it that Moses' service is testifying to? What is this word that would be spoken in later times that would enable a better house to be built? Well, we already saw it when we talked about how Moses' work paved the way for the better work that Jesus does and the house that he would one day build, Jesus. What Moses' faithfulness is testifying to is the gospel. Right? It's the good news. It's the better word that Jesus speaks, better than even the good word that Moses spoke. Better and more faithful than the faithfulness that he displayed as he led the Israelites out of slavery through the desert. Gave them the law and right up to the land of promise. And this is crucial to get because what Jesus is building is an everlasting, spotless, righteous house that could never be built by a servant. This house could only be built by a son. By the son. The only one worthy enough to build this type of house. By his own blood, right? Taking on the sin of mankind through death and yet coming out of death unscathed. And in power and in glory and in victory that he might save a people who would otherwise have no hope of being restored in fellowship to a holy God. Only the son of God himself could do this. Moses' work of redeeming, of rescuing from slavery, of bringing us home to the land of promise, it testifies to this gospel word that would in due time be spoken centuries later. Listen to what King David, the Davidic covenant, the promise that God makes to David in 2 Samuel 7. Listen to this language, this is really good. 2 Samuel 7 verse 12, it says, God is speaking to David now and he says, When your days are complete, David, and you lie down with your fathers, talking about in death, I will raise up your descendant after you, Jesus, who will come forth from you, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. Your house and your kingdom shall endure before me forever. Your throne shall be established forever, David. This was always the plan. Only the son could build this type of house. Only a perfect descendant from David could establish this work of redeeming his church. An everlasting house, established in righteousness with a people reconciled back to God. Jesus is greater than Moses because Jesus is faithful as a son. And the author knows how essential it is that we see Jesus as greater than Moses, how fundamental it is that Jesus is the ultimate object of our faith and the great hope of our lives. It's why he works so hard in this letter to the Jews to elevate Christ in our hearts and our minds so that there would be no chance of any other idol or affection that takes its place and tries to rob him of his glory. That's why he calls us to faith more and more as the book continues. Jesus is worthy of infinitely more glory than Moses because of Jesus' perfect faithfulness to the Father, because of his faithfulness as the builder of the house, and because of his faithfulness as the son of God, the only one who could save and redeem mankind. And so this leads us now to our two ending conclusions, really two points of application as we wrap up. Look at the second half of verse six. We read the first half. It says this, and we, right, this is believers, this is the readership, and we are his house if indeed we hold fast our confidence and our boasting in our hope. So first, our first conclusion that we land on here. By faith, Jesus keeps us in his house. By faith, Jesus keeps us in his house. Hebrews 11.1, Philippians 1.6 are two promises about the nature of faith and insurance and the Lord keeping us that speak to this reality of him holding fast his house. Because of the promises that he makes to keep his house, right, we, what's our response, church? We look to him in faith again and again every day, even when it's hard to believe and even when we don't want to believe. Because as he said, right, we know that he is the work. We know that he is the builder. We know that he is keeping us in his house and sustaining his people and that what establishes us as his house, as his people, as his body, as his church, was always faith and looking to the builder of the house first and foremost, never to ourselves. This is what he's addressing here. By faith, he keeps us in his house. Our second conclusion, our second takeaway, is that Jesus is worthy of all of our confidence, boasting, and hope. Jesus is worthy of every ounce of our confidence, our boasting, and our hope. Each of us can ask ourselves even today, where am I with this? How does this apply to me? Where is my confidence? Where is my boasting? What am I hoping in? Some of us might be experiencing a lack of joy or hope. We might be struggling with fears or a lack of confidence in Christ. And yet we are called to remember that he has dealt the death blow to death, to sin, to Satan, and that he is building his kingdom on earth through us, right? A work that will only continue to get exponentially greater and greater as his kingdom is revealed. And because of this, Jesus is worthy of our confidence, our boasting, and our hope. Shah Jahan built one of the most beautiful structures that we have, again, one of the wonders of the world today, because of his fierce love for his wife. And yet as beautiful as it is, at the end of the day, this house that we travel all over the world to visit and to see and to stand and to marvel at, to be amazed by, it's actually this house is a tomb with bones inside of it. It's empty. As beautiful as it is, it is a structure of death. How much more then will the beauty of Christ's house, a house filled with life, a house made up of a redeemed people, a house that Christ is building for his bride, shine throughout eternity forever and ever. How much more beauty then will there be in that house that Jesus is building for his beloved, which is his church, which is us. Our great bridegroom is worthy of all of our confidence, our boasting, and our hope, every ounce of our faith, every energy and effort of seeking and pursuing, knowing and following him. And so cling to him this week. Run to him. By faith let him be your refuge and your joy and your strength. Let's pray. Father, thank you that you are greater than any man that ever lived. Lord, we praise you that all throughout the word, throughout the scriptures, God, we can see that you have been building a house. God, you have been revealing yourself. We now see even more clearly on this side of Christ the work that you have been doing. And I pray that today we would take unique and strengthening comfort in that. May we rest in the fact that you are building your house, that you are doing a work in each one of us that will be fully manifested and completed at the day when you return. At the day when you return. Lord, may we hope in that day. God, though we are fallen and frail, though we sin, though we make mistakes, you are perfect. You are perfectly faithful to the Father. And because of that we can have joy. We can delight in you. We can have confidence for the day. We can know that you're still at work. You have not forsaken us. Oh God, would you help us to remember this now. Remember this as we go throughout our weeks, as things get hard, as the pressure comes on. May you be our delight, Lord Jesus. We pray all these things in your name. Amen.
