Romans 5 verse 1, therefore since we have been justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. This is the word of the Lord. What would you give for peace? What would you give for peace with God? What would you give to know that you have a good standing before God the creator and judge of the universe? What would you give to know that right now this very moment he really is pleased with you and not angry with you and entirely at peace with you? What would you give to know today that when you meet your maker and stand in the day of judgment that you really will be entirely forgiven and accepted and embraced for all of eternity by the king of the universe? What would you give for peace? In 1505, 22-year-old Martin Luther left law school to join a monastery in Erfurt, Germany to become a monk and to get right with God. There in the monastery he became the greatest monk ever born, the greatest monk in the history of the world. Quote, if anyone, Luther said, if anyone could have earned heaven by the life of a monk it was I. He confessed all of his sins and I need you to understand when I say all of his sins I mean he confessed all of his sins, sometimes up to six hours in one time, utterly exhausting his confessors. Can you just imagine them sort of seeing Luther coming and then like, oh no, I'm not, it's your turn. He prayed endlessly long prayers, he fasted constantly far above and beyond the required fast for the monks. He, in his later life, testified he destroyed his bowels. He had constant, I'm not gonna get into the gory details, but he had constant issues with his gut because of the punishment he had afflicted and inflicted upon himself all to earn God's favor. He punished himself with a whip, he subjected himself to sleepless nights, he would intentionally refuse blankets in the dead of winter. Quote, when I was a monk I wearied myself greatly for almost 15 years with the daily sacrifice. I earnestly thought and tried to acquire righteousness from God by my works. I tortured myself with prayer, with fasting, with vigils, with freezing. The frost alone might have killed me, end quote. I think only those among us with the most tender of consciences, trending maybe even a little neurotic, and you know who you are, I think only those among us can even possibly fully relate to Luther in this way. Most of us, the rest of us, are quite skilled at numbing our consciences. You sort of have to to function healthfully in this life, don't you? So we don't ask ourselves questions too difficult, we grow accustomed to letting ourselves off the hook pretty easily, we don't wrestle seriously with God's righteous demands, and we just move on long before we ever spiral into our own doubts about the realities of life, about the reality of our souls, of our sin, and of God and of his coming judgment. And yet every single one of us knows what it is to drink the deadly poison of trying to earn God's favor by our own works, by our own righteousness. All of us relate to Luther in that way. Maybe some of you are drinking from that cup still this morning thinking you can still today, you'll be okay, you are okay with God because of what you've done, because of who you are. Luther subjected himself willingly to a life of misery, all in a desperate attempt to find peace with God, and he came up at the end of it all entirely empty. Quote, I was myself driven to the very abyss of despair so that I wished I had never even been born. Love God, I hated him. If you have a Bible, I invite you to turn with me to Romans chapter 5. This morning I'm taking a pause from our journey through Genesis, two days before Reformation Day we are today, when Luther accidentally set off an explosive chain reaction which ultimately resulted in the rediscovery of the gospel and which ultimately shook up all of Europe and the world. And so this morning I want to, two days before Reformation Day, I want to preach a Reformation sermon. I want to preach a sermon on the greatest of all the themes and really the song of the Reformation and justification by faith. So Romans 5.1, I'm gonna take just one verse this morning and we're gonna look at it together. I'll read it again for us. Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. One verse, and there are two glorious doctrines I want to show you from this verse this morning. And I hesitate to even call them that, to call them doctrine, because doctrine to us makes us think of something we grab up off of the highest rare bookshelf along with the other rare dictionaries and it's obscure and has nothing to do with our lives, but that's exactly what these are. They're doctrines and these doctrines are glorious doctrines for your life, for your sanity in this real world, this real life which you are now living. So two doctrines I want to show you this morning. Maybe some of you this morning are exhausted and and honestly unsure where you stand before God. Were you to die today? If so, this is your morning. If you would only grasp these two realities I'm going to show you from this one verse this morning, well, paradise awaits you. The first thing I want to show you this morning is justification by faith. First glorious doctrine, I'm going to show you two. Justification by faith. Therefore, Paul writes, since we have been justified by faith. Just and justified and right and righteous are all built off of the same word. This isn't obvious. They're all related terms. This isn't obvious in English, but in Greek they're all built off of the same word in the same root. Just, justified, right, and righteous. To be justified is to be, you have to understand this, to be justified is to be weighed, to be measured on some scale, and to be declared for your weight to come out, if you will, right, righteous, just, perfect. That's what it means to be justified. Think of a diamond. To test a diamond and to prove whether or not it's authentic or fake, you have to put it into an entirely dark room and you have to shine a special ultraviolet light upon it and an expert has to look at how the stone interacts with and reacts to that light to determine, based on the glow of the diamond, authentic or fake, pure or impure. To be justified, listen, is to stand before God Almighty, the just judge who sees all, even to the intention of your heart, and to have his expert gaze survey you inside and out before the blazing light of his holiness, and to render a judgment about you, righteous, just, without flaw, this one, sinless. That is what it means to be justified. Do you see that? Do you get that? Do you understand that? It means to be weighed by the Holy God of the universe, to be tested inside and out in all of us, past, present, all of us, and to be evaluated, to be declared by the righteous one, by the Holy One, pure, sinless, without fault. And who could ever, in their right mind, hope to attain such a judgment, such a declaration from God? Romans 5.1 comes on the heels of an argument. Since we're not studying the book of Romans together, I'll just briefly rehearse it for you. Paul's been making a case, presenting a case, and with it, presenting evidence and proofs that all the cases, justification, he's arguing, is by faith. That happens. God declares, is declaring, sinners righteous by faith. So chapters 1 and 2 and the first part of chapter 3 all demonstrate the need for justification, the need for justification. Paul shows that all, that's that's Jews and Gentiles, yes, even the Jews, even even God's chosen people with the book, all stand condemned before God. Chapter 3 verse 10 summarizes Paul's argument in this first part of the letter when he says, none is righteous, no, not one. So as things stand on account of your unrighteousness, my unrighteousness, Paul says, the wrath of God is coming. Chapter 2 verse 5, for the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all unrighteousness and ungodliness in men who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth. So that's part one of Paul's letter to the Romans. Wrath, God's wrath, because of your, my, everyone's unrighteousness. So all, Paul is showing, need to be justified. Somehow we got to find a way because we all need to, none of us are gonna get that standing we must have before God on our own. There's a great need to be justified. Beginning in chapter 3 verse 21, Paul's argument changes and he presents a new idea, an explosive idea, which changed Paul's life, which changed the world. Chapter 3 verse 21 says, but now, listen to this, but now the righteousness of God has been revealed. The righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. This is one of the most important sections, the second section of Romans, in all of sacred scripture. As Paul here shows, not just the need for justification, but the way of justification. How, how, yes, men, women are being justified. How? It's through faith in Jesus Christ. Justification is now happening. People are somehow being counted righteous, Paul says. They're entering under that holy gaze of God Almighty at the judgment and some of the people are passing the test. They're being declared perfect. How? It's not happening by works, Paul says. Nobody's kept all of the law, now or ever before. It's happening, Paul says, on account of their faith. Faith, he says in chapter 4, like Abraham had. Even he, before there was the law, was counted righteous by God. Why? Because he believed. He believed in God. Paul summarizes his argument in the second section in chapter 3 verse 28 when he says, for we hold, we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law. That's the argument of Romans so far and so it makes perfect sense. The need for justification, the new way of justification by faith and so it makes perfect sense as we arrive at chapter 5 and to our verse for study this morning when Paul begins, therefore, therefore, in light of all everything I just showed you, therefore, since we have been justified by faith. I want to show you, just make two quick observations from these summarizing loaded words of the Apostle Paul in the first part of verse 1. Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, two quick observations. First of all, notice we're justified, how? By faith and by faith alone. You have to understand this or you'll never understand salvation, you'll never find peace with God, you'll never understand the gospel which is the point of the Bible. We are justified by faith and by faith alone. Paul's entire argument thus far is that there is nothing that you can do, nothing that I can do to contribute whatsoever to our salvation. You cannot keep the law, you cannot do enough good works, you cannot deny yourself enough, you cannot be good enough and actually if you try, if you stake your soul on anything you've done, if you trust in anything inside of you, your intelligence, your goodness, your heart, I have a good heart, I mean well in my heart, your effort, then Paul says you're under a curse. Galatians 3 10 for cursed is anyone who relies on works of the law. If you add anything to the color white, it's no longer white. Such is the nature of white, it's the lightest color and it's the purest color. So too, Paul is saying, if you add anything to faith, if you stake your hopes on it, if you add anything on top of faith for your hopes, for your salvation, then you've spoiled faith. You no longer have faith. It really must be faith alone or it's not faith at all, Paul says. And it's faith alone because it's Christ alone. And what makes faith so uniquely, so singularly powerful to save, to justify, is that it's the nature of faith simply to do what? To receive, to grab, to cling, to hang on to. That's why faith is powerful because it grants us access to Jesus who alone has the power to save. Imagine, it'd be like if you wanted to join the army of some great military general and you come to this military general offering all of your resume. You have an impressive resume. So you bring your sword, you bring your previous victories in battle, you bring your armor, you bring your military mind and expertise, you bring with you a herd of your allies who fought behind you in the past. And imagine if the general then looked at you and said, I will take you into my army under one condition. You must leave all of that behind and you must never speak of it again. You must unconditionally surrender everything you've done, everything you think you know, because all of that, the general says, is nothing to me. All of that is rubbish to me. That surrender in that illustration is everything. Why? Because it's now claiming nothing to recognize the supreme value of the one who you are enlisting for. Listen, that's faith. That's what faith is like in the Bible. It is the unconditional surrender of everything. It's claiming and holding on to nothing. Empty hands we bring in order, why? To receive everything from Christ, the supremely, the only valuable one. We're justified by faith and faith alone. This separates the teaching of the Bible, hear me on this, from every other religion in all of the world, sadly to this day, it separates the teaching of the Bible from traditional Roman Catholicism. And most importantly for you and for me this morning, it separates the teaching of the Bible, it separates the gospel, this, faith and faith alone, from the natural religion of your heart, which you will believe by default if you do not hear and heed the shocking message of the gospel. We all want to earn our salvation, all of us, no exceptions. We're all born, if we believe in any kind of God, thinking that somehow we can figure out a way to earn his salvation. So we compare ourselves to others, we do what we can, at least partly, we want to at least add, contribute something to faith. But faith, Paul says, stands alone. And so it must, it ever must stand alone because Christ stands alone as the only righteousness, as the only righteous one. Second quick observation from this first part of verse 1, when does this happen? When will this happen? Justification by faith. I want you to notice that Paul says, notice the words carefully here, since we have been justified. Have been justified. That means what? That means past, that means already happened, that also means present, that means presently enjoying this status of justified by and before God. Listen, if you have believed in Christ, if you have surrendered all of your rights, all of your life, all of your everything to Christ, then if you can believe it, heaven has already rendered a verdict with respect to your soul, your life, your eternity. You've already been, Paul says, you've already been declared righteous. That's what Paul says. If you can believe it, this is massive. If you live the rest of your life as if you're waiting a final verdict and a final judgment from God, which depends upon your heart today and upon your obedience tomorrow, maybe especially upon how good your quiet time was the morning that you end up dying. If you live your life enslaved to that sort of perennial hamster wheel, do you see how hopeless that is? Do you see how exhausting you're going to be? And most importantly, do you see how gigantic a misunderstanding of the gospel that is? Have been justified by faith, Paul says. The moment you believe, which the Bible teaches is itself your belief, a miracle, a gift of God. Faith is a gift, Ephesians 2, 8, 9 says. This is why Jesus is called the author and perfecter of our faith. Not just the perfecter, we'll bring it to the end, he's also the author of our faith. The moment you believed, a verdict was declared, a status was earned, salvation was assured, wrath was assuaged, angels cheered. How can this be? Some things are so good. A basic lesson in life, something's too good to be true is, it probably is too good to be true. How can this, this feels too good to be true. How can this possibly be true? I want to give you an illustration to wrap up this first part of the sermon, and I've given this illustration before, so forgive me if I've done any kind of discipleship with you. I'm sure I've pulled out props and given this illustration to you privately, but I first discovered this. I've got nothing better. I first discovered this truth of justification by faith the summer after my freshman year of college in Clearwater Beach, Florida. I was on a summer ministry project. We were going through a workbook. I have no idea what the word, I wish I could find it. I'd be afraid to find it. I might open it up and figure out, oh my gosh, there's all kinds of problems in here, and I would never recommend this to anybody else. But this was the workbook where I first discovered what I'm teaching this morning, which is justification by faith, which I'd maybe heard of before, but which I certainly didn't understand, much less had I been moved or changed by it. And when I saw this, when I saw this illustration, when I grasped this illustration in the workbook, it changed my life forever. So I'm gonna give it to you now. The illustration is of two books, and for the first and perhaps the last time in my preaching ministry, I sort of have props with me. I've never done this before. Very against props in preaching, notwithstanding this morning. I want you to imagine the workbook said, there are two books side by side. And in the workbook it had pictures. It's a workbook. So look with me at these two books. These two books represent two different lives. This first book, let's say, is the book of your life. It is filled, as you can see, and its pages are filled with the story of your life. And so it has lots of good things in it, but it also has every sin you've ever committed. Yeah, it's a pretty big book. Mine is. Yeah. All of your righteous deeds, all of your filthy rags, all of your everything. God sees everything. Even the things that everybody in the church praised you for and cheered you on for. But God actually knows your heart. He knows how sinfully proud you are or whatever. God, who sees everything, authored this book of your life. What a terrifying note. And its pages are bound, and it's covered by a cover with a title. And the title of my book is Stephen Matthew Felton. The title of your book is your name. That's the first book. The second book is the book of another life. This is the book of the story of the life of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Now, unlike your book, most significantly, it contains zero incidents, no hint, no trace of sin. And yet, as you can see, it's a full book. It's even bigger, its pages, than my book. Why? Because it contains all the life, and all the thoughts, and all the righteous deeds. Everything recorded in the Bible. Everything unrecorded in the Bible of the life of Jesus. Those missing years of Jesus. Wouldn't you love to get a hold of what was child Jesus? What was teenage Jesus like? I don't know, but I know this. He, according to Scripture, was without sin always, forever. Even at the level of heart, of motive, God has also looked at his entire life, recorded its pages full, entirely his story, and he's also binded it, and wrapped it in a cover, and he's put a title on the page, Jesus of Nazareth. Now, here's the argument of Paul. Please hear me carefully. This is the argument of all the prophets, and all the apostles of Holy Scripture. Here is the gospel. God, the righteous judge, the only one who has the authority, who has the expertise to examine both of those books, every book, your book, and every book there is, and render a just judgment on behalf of all of heaven. God, in Christ, Paul says, is taking those two books, and he's unstitching that binding with those covers, and he's swapping the title pages of each book, so that my book, filled with my sins, and my darkness, and my deserving death, and judgment, and wrath, and hell, has now become Jesus' book, so that all of my sins has been transferred to his account, so that all of my sins have been paid for by him on the cross of Calvary. He who knew no sin, Paul says, has become sin, and he means, listen, he means he's become my sin, Jesus on the cross of Calvary, and so that his book, the righteous book, the only book ever to earn that status of just, of justified, the only book to ever be worthy of actually meriting heaven, has now become my book, and now has my name on the cover. His sinlessness, his life of perfection and righteousness, all his righteous robes, God, this is the gospel, God looks upon me, I'm now hidden in Christ, I'm covered by his pages, so God, when he looks at me, sees him, he is my righteousness, so I'm forgiven, I'm, the Bible says, a saint, I'm just, I'm justified, I'm perfect, I'm righteous in Christ, that's what it means to be justified in Christ, and that's true for everyone and for anyone who believes in the gospel of Jesus. It doesn't matter if you're rich or poor, it doesn't matter if you're a religious Jew or a pagan Gentile, it doesn't matter if you're a goody-two-shoe church kid, when you believe the gospel, it doesn't matter if you're a murderer on death row, it doesn't matter if you believed when you were so young you can't even remember how young you were and gave your life, entire life, serving Christ and so many good deeds, it doesn't matter if you believe right before you died, when there was no time left for you to honor God with a life of obedience, that's justification by faith. Listen to Luther, quote, who then can appreciate what this royal marriage, Christ and the sinner, his bride who trusts in him, who can appreciate what this royal marriage means, who can understand the riches of the glory of this grace, here this rich and divine bridegroom Christ marries this poor wicked prostitute, redeems her from all of her evil and adorns her with all of his goodness. Her sins cannot now destroy her since they are laid upon Christ and swallowed up by him as the bride in the song of Solomon sings, my beloved is mine and I am his, end quote. Luther again, quote, if you have a true faith that Christ is your Savior, listen, then at once you have a gracious God, for faith leads you in and opens up God's heart and will that you should see pure grace and overflowing love. That's the scandal of the gospel, that's the glorious doctrine of justification by faith. Do you believe it? Which doesn't stand alone, as glorious as it is, it brings with it still more blessing. So let's look secondly at one final glorious doctrine in this one verse, peace with God, peace with God. One thing everything, everybody in this room shares in common, we all want peace. We live in a chaotic world, we live chaotic lives with anxiety, with depression, with broken relationships and marriages, with evil, with mass shootings, with death all around us, and we all in that world and in our worlds, we all want to find peace in our lives. We're all searching for peace. After sin entered the world and and then the promises of a deliverer, of a seed, as we've been searching for the seed, journeying through Genesis, well the prophets repeatedly after that spoke of a future day, of his, the seed that delivers future day, where God would make everything right forever. They described that day as a day of shalom, a day of peace. Haggai 2.9, listen to the word of the prophets, Haggai spoke of a restored temple and said of the temple, in this place I will give peace, declares the Lord of hosts. Micah, the prophet Micah, Micah 4, Micah 5, 4 and 5 spoke of a great shepherd who had come and he said, he shall stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the Lord and the majesty of his name. And they shall, his people, his sheep, they shall dwell secure for now he shall be great to the ends of the earth and he shall be their peace, Micah said. Isaiah 9, 6, Isaiah spoke of a baby who would come, of a virgin and Isaiah said of the baby, for unto us a child is born, to us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father and Prince of Peace. A day is coming, the prophets sing, a day marked by peace, a day where lion shall lie with lamb, where tearduct shall be dried up forever. For, the prophets wrote, a shepherd is coming, a child shall be born and his name shall be the Prince of Peace. That's the message of the prophets and then the message of the New Testament is, that man has been born, the Prince of Peace is here, that's who Jesus is and so when he's born, what are the angels peel open the heavens and Luke 2 14 says they sing, glory to God in the highest and on earth peace among those with whom he is well pleased. So after Jesus rises from the dead, his disciples go out preaching his message. Acts 10 36, what's the thrust of their message? Acts 10 36 says, as for the word that he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ, for he is Lord of all. Peace is here, the New Testament says. Peace has a name. Peace is now available to all. Don't you want peace? Now the Bible talks about, this is important, the Bible talks about two different senses of peace. So let's do a little digging here because I want to excavate just a bit beneath the surface because there's more riches, the deeper we go here. Peace is talked about in two different senses in the Bible. They're related, these two different senses of peace, but they're different and if you want to unlock the riches of this verse, Romans 5 verse 1, you need to understand the difference when the Bible speaks of the peace of God and when the Bible speaks of peace with God. In the Bible there is the peace of God and there is peace with God. Peace of God, the first kind of peace, refers to our subjective experience of peace flowing down from God. So most famously Philippians 4 says, do not be anxious about anything. But how many of you, this is a verse you just cling to, especially when times are tough. Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God. And Paul says, the peace of God which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. That's the peace of God. That's the peace we all crave, we all long for, especially when life falls apart, when a fresh wave of anxiety or chaos lands in our home, at funerals. We all want this mysterious, Paul says, surpassing understanding peace of God to rule over our hearts. We want to be okay when everything around us is not okay. Because we want to know God is doing something powerfully in our hearts to give us peace and calm and trust. This is the peace of God. The opposite of this first peace is anxiety and fear. Don't all of you want that peace? Some of you know that peace, but that's actually not this first peace, the peace of God. That's actually not the peace that Paul's talking about in Romans 5.1. Peace with God is something different. It's related, the first peace actually flows down from this second peace. But this refers to something objective, not subjective at all. Something we may or may not feel at all and whether we feel it has nothing to do with its reality. Paul's been writing about and building towards this peace throughout the book of Romans. All of Romans have been building this mounting conflict, this tension, as I showed you a bit earlier. We could even say war. Romans is a book about enemies and war and wrath. It speaks of the wrath of God often. The opposite of this second peace is not fear or anxiety. The opposite of this peace is wrath. You see, your sin sets you in conflict with God. That's what sin is. It's never impersonal. It's never strictly private. Sin is always personal. Whatever it is, it's always directed at somebody, namely the God of the universe, the Holy One, the judge of us all. So Romans 2.8 says, But for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness. He's speaking there of the unbeliever. There will be wrath and fury. You're at war with God, Paul says, whether you realized it or not. And you will always lose that war. The entire world, the flesh, the devil are all doomed to lose that war, to ignore God, to curse God, to put off God, to reject God, to deny God, to not live a life of worshipping God is to enter into the greatest war ever waged against the greatest foe in all the universe before whom none could ever possibly hope to stand, much less defeat. Peace with God means for all who believed and are thus justified, as we saw in the first part of verse one, peace with God means that for all those who believe and are justified, that war is over. It means that God's wrath has been pacified, absorbed entirely by Christ so that there's none left for you. It means that God has declared peace towards you and over you forever. It means that God, who was your enemy by our own doing, has become our friend. It means you've been reconciled entirely to him and there's no more conflict at all, even beneath the surface. There's not even that awkwardness between the two of you like, yeah, okay, we've moved past it but we're not going to bring that up. There's none of that. Look at verses 10 and 11 of chapter 5. For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his son, how much more now that we are reconciled shall we be saved by his life? More than that, Paul says, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation. Listen to me, if you're here this morning and you're a believer in the gospel of Jesus Christ, God's not mad at you anymore is what this means. Like not even a little bit. Not sometimes. Not when you have a bad day, he's mad at you on those days. That's how we work. That's not how he works and the gospel promises it. He loves you when you sing his praises. He loves you when you fall down on Sunday afternoon and blow it with your kids or your wife. Because his love for you is not conditioned upon your obedience or by your upholding your end of the gospel. That is anathema. To live like that is true is to live under a curse. His love for you is conditioned upon one thing and it's not you at all. It's his son, Jesus Christ and his obedience in your life. It's his righteousness. That's why God loves you. Therefore, since we've been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Look at verse 9. Since therefore we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God? So long as you've surrendered everything to him, and I would ask, have you given, have you laid down everything, all your rights, everything you've previously been allianced to and trusted in and looked in, even all your good works, have you believed? If you have, then God's wrath will not abide for a single second against you for the rest of your life. And God will bring you safely home forever. Justification doesn't simply give you a new status. I'm trying to show you justification gives you a new relationship. Justification gives you, if you can believe it, a friend in God, through Christ, the friend of sinners. If you want to know if you're justified, a topic of assurance, maybe you don't know. If you want to know if you're justified, one way to discover that is to answer this question. Are you a friend of God? In other words, do you relate to God as one who knows God, as one who loves God? That's what a Christian does. Because the justified, Romans 5 once says, are reconciled. Those who have been declared just have also been declared friends. They have peace with God. Does that describe your life? And oh boy, if that's not you, could it describe your life? What if this is true? What are you looking to for peace? It's worth asking yourself, asking each of ourselves, is whatever you're looking to, is it whatever you're looking for for peace, is it actually delivering? In other words, if you got it, the thing you've placed all your hopes in, the thing you live for, if you actually got it, if you actually got all of it, are you sure that would give you peace? Matthew Perry died last night. Chandler Bing. I couldn't believe it, totally could believe it, if you know his story. I read his memoir earlier this year, and in the memoir he wrote, quote, I think you have to have all your dreams come true to realize they're all the wrong dreams. End quote. What are you hoping in? What are your dreams? Are you sure if you actually got them, are you sure they would deliver you all that you've built them up to promise you? It's hard to say when Luther first fully understood himself, this teaching of justification by faith. It probably wasn't actually when he nailed his 95 theses on October 31, 1517, which marks Reformation Day. He was clearer at first on what was wrong with the medieval Catholic Church than he was on what was right and what the Bible really taught with respect to the gospel. But sometime, we don't know exactly when, but sometime over the next few years, probably while he was preparing lectures to teach his university students on this same book of Romans, a professor, mind you, with a doctorate in scripture, teaching students, but still not grasping its message, still not saved. All the knowledge in the world cannot save you. Probably sometime then, preparing those lectures in Romans, he stumbled his way into the gospel and finally discovered that the righteousness that God required was not his, Luther's righteousness at all. All his fasting, all his praying, all his self-punishment to earn God's favor and find peace, all of it he finally realized was rubbish. No, he found it was an alien righteousness, he wrote. In other words, an outside of himself, a foreign, a distant righteousness which God was speaking of in Romans, which alone can give us God's favor and grant us the peace we all so desperately long for. And he discovered with Paul that God was granting that very alien righteousness. He was just giving it out liberally for free, like wait in line and anybody can get it. And he was giving it to anybody who believed, to Jew, to Gentile, to pagan scoundrels like Jacob, to anybody who would just trade in and lay down their own righteousness for his faith. We don't know the exact moment he believed, but we know what he experienced when the moment did come, because when he was a much older man, he wrote about that moment. He said that he had hated God before because he was so terrified and because he tried so hard and he knew he could never actually measure up to God's standards. But he wrote that when he discovered this doctrine, which I'm giving you this morning, of the righteousness of God given from Christ to any who believe, he said when he was an old man that that moment was like being all together born again. And he said that in that moment he got up from his despair and his spiritual deadness and he walked through the gates and he entered into paradise. I wonder if you've walked through those gates and into paradise and into eternal peace. Let's pray. God, I pray for all searching for peace with you. To find peace in Christ and in Christ alone. God, we lay aside all of everything we've ever clinged to. God, we lay aside even our so-called righteous deeds, which your word says is filthy rags. We lay them all aside and we take Christ and his righteousness and his righteous robes and his life lived on our behalf and we take it all and we receive it by faith as ours. I pray that my prayer now would be united to the hearts of many in this room and that you would strengthen the faith of all in here and even grant the miracle of new belief, we pray. And we pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
