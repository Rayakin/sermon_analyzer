Psalm 102. Hear my prayer, O Lord. Let my cry come to you. Do not hide your face from me in the day of my distress. Incline your ear to me. Answer me speedily in the day when I call. For my days pass away like smoke, and my bones burn like a furnace. My heart is struck down like grass and has withered. I forget to eat my bread. Because of my loud groaning, my bones cling to my flesh. I am like a desert owl of the wilderness, like an owl of the waste places. I lie awake. I am like a lonely sparrow on the housetop. All the days my enemies taught me. Those who deride me use my name for a curse. For I eat ashes like bread and mingle tears with my drink. Because of your indignation and anger, for you have taken me up and thrown me down. My days are like an evening shadow. I wither away like grass. But you, O Lord, are enthroned forever. You are remembered throughout all generations. You will arise and have pity on Zion. It is the time to favor her. The appointed time has come. For your servants hold her stones dear and have pity on her dust. Nations will fear the name of the Lord, and all the kings of the earth will fear your glory. For the Lord builds up Zion. He appears in his glory. He regards the prayer of the destitute and does not despise their prayer. Let this be recorded for a generation to come, so that a people yet to be created may praise the Lord, that he looked down from his holy height. From heaven the Lord looked at the earth, to hear the groans of the prisoners, to set free those who were doomed to die, that they may declare in Zion the name of the Lord, and in Jerusalem his praise, when peoples gather together and kingdoms to worship the Lord. He has broken my strength in midcourse. He has shortened my days. Oh my God, I said, take me not away in the midst of my days, you whose years endure throughout all generations. Of old you laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands. They will perish, but you will remain. They will all wear out like a garment. You will change them like a robe, and they will pass away. But you are the same, and your years have no end. The children of your servants shall dwell secure. Their offspring shall be established before you. This is the word of the Lord. Amen. According to the sign in front of my neighbor's house, there are 37 days until Christmas. The children smile, the parents shudder. Many of us remember what it was like to anticipate, await that day. Counting down the days just like that, the anxiousness building, the anticipation getting stronger, the house starting to look different, the cheer in the atmosphere becoming clearer and clearer, all the way up until the night before. You could barely go to sleep. Some of you who are taught to, you're listening for reindeer. You're imagining what might be under that tree. Somehow this is about Jesus, you say. For roughly a month or more, depending on your household, you waited and waited happily because you knew that what was coming was wonderful. New scene. Pain. Hospital. Diagnosis. Prognosis. More pain. Worse pain. Time is short, you're told. It's a very different feeling. A very, very different thing and way to anticipate. You can barely go to sleep, not for excitement, but sadness and dread. You don't know which night it will be, but this is not wonderful, what you're waiting for. Somehow this is about Jesus, you say. We've all experienced some version of both of these things. Of both of these things. Excitement and suffering. Anticipation and anticipation. Excitement and suffering, in a way, are two different ways to experience time, aren't they? Excitement considers the future and brings it to the present. Suffering tends to consider the present and carry it into the future, map it across. Is that how it should be? In Psalm 102, you can, if you haven't, turn there, we'll see an example of suffering that borrows from the future to reinterpret the present. So Psalm 102, I'll try to set the scene for us briefly. There's actually not much to go off of to set the scene with. We don't know who it's written by, we don't know when it was written exactly. What we do see, if you noticed, as Lindsay was reading, is a man who is suffering significantly. And we also see, in parts, that he is relating that suffering somehow to Zion. He mentions Zion three times in the psalm. And as he does so, we should remember, what is Zion? Where is Zion? What is this thing? We see this word pop up a lot in the Bible. Zion is another name for the city of Jerusalem, the holy city of the Jews. But it's not just a second name, like a nickname. It represents more than just this location. It represents everything the Jewish people have set their hopes on for all time. It represents God's very presence. Zion represents them being God's chosen people. It represents the promise of a Messiah to come, to make them a powerful nation forever. It represents the place where God would be their God, and they would be his people forever. That's Zion in their minds. So you might call America, you've heard America called, the land of the free and the home of the brave. That's saying a lot more than just this location, this longitude latitude. That's telling you a story. That's giving you a set of beliefs, a lore to be part of. That's what Zion kind of is in the Jewish mind. And unfortunately, it appears, Zion is in bad shape. Look at how he talks about Zion. Verse 13, you will arise, about God, you will arise and have pity on Zion. Zion is in a state where it needs God's pity. Verse 16, this is him looking ahead to God building up Zion. Why? Because Zion is flattened right now. Verse 18, he is again looking ahead to when people will declare the Lord's name in Zion. Why? Because people are not declaring the Lord's name in Zion right now. Zion is in a sorry state. God has not built her up. People are not there praising him. When would this have been most profoundly the case in Jewish history? The exile. The exile which happened after centuries of defying and disobeying and ignoring Yahweh. Centuries of making and breaking promises to him. The Israelites finally get what they've had coming. They finally get what God had long warned them that he would do. They've been banished, they've been banished, carted away to Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar. The temple itself destroyed. The symbol of all that was bound up in the name Zion, the literal monument to centuries of salvation and protection and patience and promise. The place where God himself was present to them is now a scene of destruction, a pile of rubble. And so, verse 14, for your servants hold her stones dear and have pity on her dust. This is Zion right now. And all of this has amplified the psalmist's despair. The specifics of his suffering are his own, but they're amplified and they're wrapped up with the suffering of his people because whatever happens to Jerusalem, happens to the Jewish people, happens to him. Whatever befalls his people will befall him. So not only does he feel alone and in pain, his entire people are alone in their pain. Banished from the promised land, banished from God's presence. God is no longer, it seems, their God. They are no longer his people. In simplest terms, the relationship is over. Verse 10, startlingly, because of your indignation and anger, you have taken me up and thrown me down. What do you do when you're suffering, when your world is collapsing, and it seems that God himself may have turned his back on you? Four things. You tell God, you remember who he is, you praise God, and you trust him. Those are the movements of the psalm. You tell God, you remember who he is, you praise him, and then you trust him. We'll see the first, telling God in these first 11 verses. Read with me again, Psalm 102, verses 1 through 11. A prayer of one afflicted when he is faint and pours out his complaint before the Lord. Hear my prayer, O Lord. Let my cry come to you. Do not hide your face from me in the day of my destruction. Do not hide your face from me in the day of my distress. Incline your ear to me. Answer me speedily in the day when I call. For my days pass away like smoke, and my bones burn like a furnace. My heart is struck down like grass and has withered. I forget to eat my bread. Because of my loud groaning, my bones cling to my flesh. I'm like a desert owl of the wilderness, like an owl of the waste places. I lie awake. I'm like a lonely sparrow on the housetop. All the day, my enemies taunt me. Those who deride me use my name for a curse. For I eat ashes like bread and mingle tears with my drink because of your indignation and anger. For you have taken me up and thrown me down. My days are like an evening shadow. I wither away like grass. Have you ever felt like that? When someone asks you, how you doing? Have you ever really wished you could say that? Imagine what this guy looks like. This isn't a guy sitting in a comfortable chair in a nice air-conditioned room just imagining. What is it like to suffer? Let me exaggerate here poetically. This is testimony. This is the testimony of a life that is stricken. He feels like he's disappearing like smoke, withering like grass. His bones ache. He forgets to eat. He can't sleep. He's groaning in pain. People are taunting him. Calls himself an owl, which were considered unclean animals to be avoided. He's alone. This is sadness incarnate. This is grief. This is even depression and anxiety. Day bringing no life. Night bringing no rest. This is a person slowly disintegrating. A lot of us have felt something like this, haven't we? A lot of you here today, I know. If you haven't felt anything like this, you know somebody who has. And some of us know what it's like to feel this for a long time. And some of us know what it's like to feel this for a long time. You might have even walked in with this today. It's been a bitter week, a bitter month. It's been bitter years. What helps when we feel this way? What matters when your suffering does not seem to change, does not seem to let up? Brothers and sisters, what matters when you feel like you are wasting away, when you feel like you are alone, is that in the midst of all of it, in the midst of everything, while no one else may understand, God's own Word knows you. Do you see that? That He understands you enough to know how to describe you. Do you see that here? Friends, this is why it's important to understand Scripture as God's very Word. The Bible is God speaking for Himself through people. That's what the Bible is. So these aren't just ancient lessons that have aged well over time, or interesting glimpses into history that don't necessarily intersect with your life. They're words written to you from a living, present God who does not age, who does not change, who has never faded. And His Word, then, is eternal and alive and unchanging just as He is. Which means our psalmist here isn't just speaking for himself to an ancient Jewish audience. God is speaking through him to and about you. Are you listening to Him? You are listening to Him now. Are you listening to Him in life? Are you listening to Him on Monday? Are His words on your mind? Are His words in your mind not just as the commands that He calls you to follow, but are His words on your mind because you believe that He knows you better than anyone else does? That His words describe you better than anyone else can. Look at how He knows you Look at how He knows you in your suffering. What is His Word for us, then, when we are in pain? Verse 1. Hear my prayer, O Lord. Let my cry come to you. Do not hide your face from me. Incline your ear to me. Answer me speedily when I call. His Word for us in our suffering is to tell Him everything. Like children. Children are incredibly uncomplicated when they're in need. They tell you everything. The pain that they feel, the many pains that don't seem relevant at all. That's what God invites us to do. We, in our flesh, can get tired of hearing about people's hardships over and over again. God does not. God welcomes it. God is listening. You even look at the title of the psalm. This is actually part of Scripture. A prayer of one afflicted when he's faint and pours out his complaint before the Lord. The Hebrew word there for complaint really does mean complaint. It doesn't mean something more mild or like put together. It's saying complain. The word for pour out there is the same word that the priests would have for pouring out the blood on the altar. God is saying drench me with your distresses. Pour yourself out. Wring yourself out before Him. Make a mess of what's happening in your life before Him. And what will we find? We will find that He does not flinch. That He doesn't ignore you nor condemn you for how you feel. That He doesn't taunt you like the enemies do. That He listens to you. And that as He listens to you, already knowing exactly what's happening in your life, He's listening to you while also knowing everything else that is happening in the world, in the universe. As one pastor put it, God is doing 10,000 things in your life. You may be aware of three of them. When those three things are hard, when even one of them is hard, tell Him. Secondly, we remember who He is. Verses 12 to 17. But you, O Lord, are enthroned forever. You are remembered throughout all generations. You will arise and have pity on Zion. It is the time to favor her. The appointed time has come. For your servants hold her stones dear and have pity on her dust. Nations will fear the name of the Lord, and all the kings of the earth will fear your glory. For the Lord builds up Zion. He appears in His glory. He regards the prayer of the destitute and does not despise their prayer. When you begin to tell God about your languishing, what happens is, in the process, you remember who He is. So what's the psalmist here? Remember about God as he's complaining to him. The psalmist feels that his life is wasting away, right? We see that laced throughout. Verse 3, days are passing away like smoke. That's what he's feeling. That's the nature of his suffering. What does he remember? What does he remember about God? That God is everlasting. He feels like his life is shortening and shortening and shortening. He realizes, he remembers that God's life has no limits. Verse 11, this is him. My days are like an evening shadow. I wither away like grass. What does he remember about God? Verse 12, but you, O Lord, are enthroned forever. Remembered throughout all generations. Do you see that contrast? He's withering. God is everlasting. Lord, I'm wasting away. I'm vanishing into nothing. I'm coming to an end. You last forever. It's an exact contrast. This is so often what God's word shows us about him, about him and us. That he is the exact opposite of whatever is burdening us. He's the exact antidote to our exact diseases. He's the positive to every specific negative in us and around us. Some familiar verses here that show this. As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good. O Lord, how many are my foes? But you, O Lord, are a shield. My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart. When we were dead in our trespasses, God made us alive together with Christ. You see that dynamic? What we experience and who God is. We experience evil, God is good. We feel surrounded, God is the shield. Our hearts fail, God is strength. We are dead, God makes us alive. Our very deficits and needs are the very attributes and gifts of God. Have you experienced this? That when you were afraid, God was bigger than what you were afraid of. That when you experienced great loss, God turned out to be enough. That when your life was in disarray, your responsibilities, the expectations around you piling up, God was unshaken and strong. If you're a believer, you know that when you were at your most despicable, God was loving and forgiving and cleansing. This is who God is. In your need, He is what you need. In your lack, He is what you lack. What does the psalmist lack here and need? What is he looking for? The psalmist is looking for hope. Hope that God would turn from his anger and come to Zion again. Hope that God will hear him in his suffering. And what does he remember? Verse 13, he remembers, he recalls, he sets his mind upon the fact that God will arise and have pity on Zion and favor her. He sets his mind upon, verse 15, that the nation's people beyond Zion will fear and praise the Lord. Verse 17, he sets his mind on the fact that God does regard and does not despise the prayer of the destitute. He's applying specific realities about God because these are the specific realities he's doubting. And in doing so, he's echoing what God has promised. He's relying on, using what God has promised elsewhere. Psalm 9, the Lord sits enthroned forever. Isaiah 51, the Lord comforts Zion. Genesis 26, in you all the nations of the earth shall be blessed. Psalm 22, he has not despised the affliction of the afflicted but has heard their cries. He's not making anything up. Brothers and sisters, when suffering comes, what do you think about? What do you draw upon? The best thing to remember is who God is in light of what you are suffering. The Psalms tell us that. 46 times, more than any other book, the Psalms tell us to remember. Remember who he is. Remember what he's done. Remember what he's going to do. Remember the things that you actually don't see yet. So, as we read this, no, you were not in the Jewish exile and that crisis, but you have, and you will, feel and know that same helplessness. When you've been brought low like that, tell God and remember him in your helplessness as the helper. Thirdly, we praise God. 18 to 22. Let this be recorded for a generation to come, so that a people yet to be created may praise the Lord, that he may look down from his holy height from heaven. The Lord looked at the earth to hear the groans of the prisoners, to set free those who were doomed to die, that they may declare in Zion the name of the Lord and in Jerusalem his praise when peoples gather together and kingdoms to worship the Lord. Contrast that with the verses that he began with. That's quite a change. But this is what happens when we empty ourselves before God and remember who he is. What happens is we realize that the biggest circumstance in our life is not our suffering, but God, and when you realize that, it leads to praise. Think about when you've been most praise-giving of God in your life, most grateful, most content, most joyful in him. It probably wasn't just because you learned some new songs, although that may have helped. It was probably more because God had, in general, become a greater reality in your life. That you realized that everything you had came from him, that your whole life was a gift of grace. You had an experience that God came through, and you were able to map that out for yourself. You realized that across the bigger picture of your whole life, this must be who God is to me. You felt what C.S. Lewis famously said, I believe in Christ as I believe that the sun has risen, not only because I see it, but because by it, I see everything else. You saw more clearly that God is the horizon, the canopy. When we go from God being oriented around our lives, to our lives being oriented around him, when we see that our circumstances aren't for getting God to turn to us, but to get us to turn to God, that's when we turn from complaint, even legitimate complaint, about legitimate suffering, to praise. Because what happens is your perspective has gotten bigger. You've zoomed out a bit on the map. You see that there is a bigger story that you're part of. Yes, you might be in the valley, but you're also, you realize, at the foot of a glorious mountain range. And not only that, even when you're in the valley, and not only that, even more unnatural things start to happen. You start to see that your witness to God in your suffering can even be a blessing to others. Look at what he says in verse 18. Let this be recorded for a generation to come, so that a people yet to be created may praise the Lord. People not even created, nobody that he knows. In the midst of your affliction, when all that you hold dear is slipping away, when you start to see that God is still bigger than those things, you can turn your attention away from yourself, and toward the welfare of even people that you'll never meet. You become interested in the joy of strangers. What a freeing way to live. As we often sing, O my soul, praise him, for he is my health and salvation. How does it end? Let the amen sound from his people again. Gladly, we'll always adore him. When you're suffering, tell God. Remember who he is in accordance to your suffering, and then you'll find yourself changed from complaint to praise. Lastly, trust God. 23 to the end. He has broken my strength in midcourse. He has shortened my days. O my God, I say, take me not away in the midst of my days, take me not away in the midst of my days, you whose years endure throughout all generations. Of old you lay the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands. They will perish, but you will remain. They will all wear out like a garment. You will change them like a robe, and they will pass away. But you are the same, and your years have no end. The children of your servants shall dwell secure. Their offspring shall be established before you. You know, you might think that after verses 18 to 22, verse 23 does not show up, right? But what does he show us? He shows us that remembering who God is, even praising him, don't mean that you need to pretend that your suffering isn't real. You don't have to feign ignorance about the realities of your life, the challenges of your life. You don't have to act like just believing in him means that your life is easy. No, God has, he still feels that God has shortened his days. But the other thing we're also ushered away from is from making our sufferings the whole story of our lives. Yes, they are real. Yes, they are true. Yes, they may continue for a time. But if God is real and actually is infinite in his person, if he is all wise in what he does, if he is completely sovereign and omnipresent, then he is by far the greatest circumstance of your life, is he not? Everything else in your life comes and goes. Everything and everyone in your life comes and goes. God does not. God is the strongest data of your life. He is the strongest one and you are his. Which is how he goes from verses 18 to 22 to also 23 to 24. He starts, I hope generations come to praise you. You, the one who rescues Zion, I trust kingdoms will come and worship the Lord. Immediately he has broken me, shortened my days. Ongoingly his suffering, but he continues. What does he do? He brings together his suffering and what he's remembered about God. Verse 24, oh my God, I say, take me not away in the midst of my days, you whose years endure throughout all generations. What's he doing? He's showing what it looks like to trust God in the midst of suffering specifically. He tells God what exactly he's going through. He feels broken, feels like his days are cut short. Then he remembers that those are the very ways that God is full and not empty like he is. God is never broken. God is never ending. And so knowing that, even trusting that, he actually makes a specific request about his suffering for the first time in the psalm. He doesn't ask God of anything until now, specifically verse 24. Oh my God, take me not away. It's in putting together specifically and knowingly what I'm going through and who God is in contrast and then going to him with that knowledge. That's what trusting God is. That's intelligently trusting God. Bringing what you need before all that God possesses and then trusting he will do what is right. And you can see how these things feed into each other, right? We tell God what's going on. We remember what he's like in the process. We turn to praise because he transcends what we're going through. Then we trust him because we know that he knows exactly what we're enduring. And in our trust, we express that to him in prayer and it goes like that. You know what comes of that? You know what happens after years, a lifetime of that feedback loop? What builds? What happens in you is true, functional, difference-making and personal knowledge of God that you can apply for the rest of your life. What happens in that pattern and habit of telling, remembering, praising and trusting and over and over again, what happens, what builds, what fortifies is real, functional, difference-making, personal knowledge of God that you can apply for the rest of your life. And in a word, that's what spiritually maturing is. It's seeing more and more how God is specifically the supply to your specific needs. And the psalm ends with the specific way that God is the psalmist and all of our supply in our suffering. What is the psalmist getting at about God here? That God, unlike him, will remain. God will remain. When you are coming undone, God will remain. When your world is crumbling, God will remain. He made the heavens and the earth and they will all perish. They will all wear out. All that is in them, including our very lives, will pass away. But God's years have no end. And so certain is his permanence, so certain his promise to glorify himself among the nations. In other words, so certain is the future that the psalmist returns again to a perspective bigger than his own life. Verse 28, the children of your servants shall dwell secure. Their offspring shall be established before you. His current sufferings are what they are. But if God will remain, then what's even more significant, what's more powerful, is that though the earth and the heavens pass away, even as he feels he is, generations of people will be secure in God still. The psalmist is anchored in the wonder that God is more committed to the security of his people than he is to even the universe itself. Brothers and sisters, earth and space will grow old and pass away. You will be safe in the one who is everlasting. This is how we suffer according to the future. To set our minds upon glory that is coming, glory that transcends even the most pampered, painless life that you could imagine. There's glory that's better than that, that includes your suffering. Which is, of course, exactly the life that Jesus lived, wasn't it? This is, most of all, a song of Jesus's life. He being eternally alive to having his days cut short. None more alone, none more taunted, none more acquainted with grief, none more a man of sorrows. The one who prayed with most undeserved agony, oh my God, take me not away in the midst of my days. No one has prayed that prayer more truthfully and deeply than him. He who in the fullness of his suffering trusted God unto his death and what did his death accomplish? His death accomplished what the psalmist is anticipating. Verse 20, his own groaning releases the prisoners. His own death sets free the doomed. Do you know that you were a prisoner doomed to die? Like Israel, of your own making, of your own disobedience and discrediting of God, your only way to be set free is to trust in the one who did it for you. Turn to him, not yourself, not self-improvement. It is not there. That is not trusting God. Trust in him. The glory that the psalmist trusted God would bring forth came through the suffering of his son. And so, it is the reward of the nations gathering together to praise him that we have joined in with. The thing that the psalmist is anticipating, that he's waiting for, the people praising him, we're part of that. He is part of that because of what Jesus did. His suffering then has turned to his own suffering. It has turned us to praise, hasn't it? And when that day comes, when we will actually see this one who remains, we too will rejoice that even though our days sometimes felt like they were passing away like smoke, so will have passed every one of your sufferings. Let's pray. Lord, we come now to consider and even remember who you are. That in the face of our needs, you are full and strong and plenty. God, you know every one of our needs, every one of our weaknesses, every one of our pains. God, we ask that you would use your word by your spirit to help us turn to you and help us to be refreshed in the life-giving and mind-broadening knowledge of you. You who is full in every way, you who will remain though we pass. Help us, Lord, to grow content in the life that you have assigned because we trust that you are good and that you are bringing about good that will last forever. Teach us, Lord, these things. In Christ's name, amen.
