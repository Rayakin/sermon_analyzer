One of the first scenes in the movie from 1962, where are we going, where are we going? The Lawrence of Arabia. One of the first scenes in that movie is a funeral. It's a funeral for the main character, T.E. Lawrence. He was a real life British officer who served during the First World War and afterwards he wrote extensively about his experiences. He obviously did not write about his funeral, so this scene was added by the screenwriters, but they did so to provide some important context for how they would show his character for the rest of the movie. And so in this funeral scene, as the funeral ends, he was a famous person, a lot of dignitaries, famous people were attending this funeral. So there's a reporter who shows up, and he's asking people, what was this man like? He wants to write a story, he wants to know who he was. And he asks one man, what was Lawrence like? And the man replies, well, it was my privilege to know him. He was a poet, a scholar, and a mighty warrior. The reporter writes all that down and then he leaves. As soon as the reporter leaves, the man turns to the person next to him and says, he was also the greatest exhibitionist since Barnum and Bailey. It means he liked attention. We also see an army officer and a priest inside the cathedral where the funeral had taken place, and they're standing and talking in front of this bust of Lawrence that was made in time for the funeral. The officer turns to the priest and says, he was the most extraordinary man I ever met. Did you know him well, the priest asked him. The officer pauses, and he says, well, I knew him. The priest responds, well, nil nisi bonum. That's Latin shorthand for of the dead, only good can be said. You guys understand what he's saying and what that means. It's typical for certainly at a funeral to withhold any of your more raw thoughts about a person. In fact, we tend to bring that approach into both life and death, with the living as well as the dead, don't we? There are many things that we could say about a lot of the people that we know, but we tend to shy away from saying the harder truths, certainly in a funeral setting. The Bible does not take that approach. The Bible doesn't go behind your back to gossip about you. It offends you to your face. If you haven't already, turn to Romans 5. We've preached from Romans three or four times over the years. Maybe one day we'll preach from the beginning to the end. A few weeks ago, Matt preached from Romans as part of his summer series, and we're kind of parachuting back in today. But that might be an issue for some of the parts of Romans that are a little more complicated. Our text today, I hope, even as you heard MC read for us, you can tell that it's rather clear. I'll read for us once more, Romans 5, 6 to 8. For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. For one will scarcely die for a righteous person, though perhaps for a good person one would even dare to die. But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. You might summarize those three verses as Christ died for the ungodly, including you. Christ, Jesus Christ, died for the ungodly, which includes you. We'll look at that in three headings as we continue on. First, what happened? Second, what then happened? And thirdly, why did it happen at all? What happened? What then happened? And then finally, why did it happen at all? First, what happened? What happened? Think about when you usually ask that question in life. When do you tend to ask, what happened? I think it's usually one of two scenarios, right? Number one, somebody's telling you a story about some incident in their day, and before they finish you interrupt them and say, so what happened? Or the second scenario, you ask what happened when there's clearly a problem. When you walk in and one of your children has completely covered your other child in peanut butter. What happened? When you walk in and there's something broken on the floor. When you pick up the phone and there are tears on the other line. What happened? You ask that when there's a problem. And really, we could ask that question about our whole lives, couldn't we? There's a problem in our lives. There's a problem that has infected the whole world, isn't there? Maybe you've put your finger on it, maybe you've thought about it, maybe you've tried to ignore it as best you can. But there's a problem, and we can ask, we should ask, what happened? See, what happened was, as Paul says a little later in verse 12, sin came into the world. And through sin, death entered the world. The thing that happened behind all of the problems that cause you to ask what happened, that thing happened really early on, near the beginning. It happened while everything was perfect in the garden, you know the story, while everything was paradise. What happened was, man wanted more. What happened was, there was a forbidden tree that man didn't think should be that forbidden anymore. What happened was, with some encouragement from the neighborhood serpent, Adam and Eve chose to disobey God's clear commands. What God made good, as he did those first six days, everything he made, good, good, good, people, very good. What he made and called good, they decided to call not good enough. No, no. Man wanted to be like God himself. And so, what did they do? They ended up, there's the line between creator, creation, creature, they crossed it. They crossed into creator territory. And from that moment on, all subsequent creatures and creation, all mankind, went from good to not good enough. Went from pure and whole to broken. The best we can now be is broken. The fate that we all now face is death. This, of course, includes you, all of us. Because you're not just some innocent bystander to what's happened to the world. You're not just suffering under, you're not just a victim of the brokenness and death out there. You actually help perpetuate it a little bit. Have you ever disobeyed your maker? Have you ever acted selfishly? Have you ever thought, I know better than what God says. Have you ever done that? Of course you have. So, it's not that you just endure the wrongness of the world out there. You bring your own wrongness seasoning and sprinkle it around. Your own ways, the ways your heart uniquely and personally twists away from God. You bring that to the world. Thank you. When sin and death came into the garden, sin and death also came into all nature, including your and my nature. Fundamentally. That's the big what happened in the world. Sin entered the world and sin entered you. That's what Paul means when he describes us in verse 6 here, as weak and ungodly. We're weak. We're too weak. We're too powerless to do anything about the sin that is now in us. We're too, we can't delete it. We can't erase it. We can't get rid of it. We can't uproot it. We're weak. And when it's sin that is in you and determines more and more, or any part of how you live, what does that mean? What does that mean you look like? You look like ungodliness. Paul's not exaggerating here. He's not inventing terminology here. He's being very reasonable. X plus Z equals Y. That doesn't make sense. X plus Y equals Z. One plus two equals three. How about that? Think back to the last time somebody told you what you're like. Has anybody ever told you what you're like? Maybe, maybe not. Sometimes it's encouraging. Other times it's a little painful, isn't it? They're telling you things about yourself that you maybe don't want to hear, but you kind of need to hear. You kind of clearly haven't figured it out yourself, so somebody's just got to tell you. Now, the truth is, if you actually want to know what you are like, if you want to have a more accurate picture of yourself, especially so if you want to really grow as a person, you need to listen to the people who have spent time with you, who are around you, who've observed you. They can tell things about you that are obvious to everybody but you. It's like the opposite of magic, right? It's like the audience can see exactly everything, but the magician can't see anything. It's the reverse. We need other people to do that kind of work for us, to see us, to see the things we can't see. Now, has anybody told you, hey, hey, I just got to say, you're just fundamentally weak. Not like weak in some specific way or some small way or some part of you is weak, like physically or mentally. Not that that's what's better. No, no, no. You're like entirely weak. Categorically, fundamentally, as a whole. That'd be a shameful thing to be told. We spend our entire lives, in fact, from infancy, really trying to defy that, right? Trying to prove, no, I'm not too weak to walk. I'm not too weak to speak or do anything that you do, mom or dad. We work and live against weakness, and yet Paul says, no, no, no, this is all of us. This is all of you. Weak. He gives us no disclaimer. He doesn't wink at us at all. This is really about the people that we all know are weaker than us. He doesn't say anything like that. In fact, he includes himself. He doesn't need to catch that. We, while we, we're still weak. Paul the apostle. Because he knows all creatures, all creatures that carry that bare sin, fundamentally now, weak. Powerless. That would be one thing if that's all Paul said. That's far from all that Paul said. In fact, earlier in chapter two, Paul says some much more specific things. He calls his readers judgmental, presumptuous, hard-hearted, hypocritical. These are ostensibly Christians that he's writing to. You're also saints, brothers, hard-hearted, hypocritical. No one at Paul's funeral would call him a flatterer, for sure. And now here, at the end of verse six, he presses on. He calls us, he calls us, all of us, ungodly. Has somebody ever called you ungodly? Hey, I just got to tell you. You're just, you know, you're just really ungodly. With a smile. What could be worse? What could be worse than hearing that? You know, it's just like, hey, you're like a really picky eater. No, no, no. You're ungodly. Here's the thing that we can't lose sight of. These are not just the writings of a guy from centuries ago, a guy named Paul just having a bad day. This is part of God's Word that is for all people, that is for all of us, for all time. Which means, of all the people who could offend you with what they have to say about you, no one has worse things to say about you than God. Do you see that? The one who has the worst things to say about you. Think about the person who likes you the least in the world. Like, you just know, ah, we don't just get along. They actually don't like me. It's kind of an amazing feeling. It's almost like freeing the first time that happens. That person, what that person has to say about you is not as mean as what God has to say about you, not as offensive. The most offended by you, the one most offended by you is the one who made you. How about that? He can't believe that he made you and you turned out that way. In chapter 3, you can hear the frustration in Paul's voice. This is how he describes us. None is righteous. No, not one. No one understands. No one seeks God. All have turned aside. All have become worthless. No one does good, not even one. There's no fear of God before their eyes. Paul's talking about your eyes and mine. It's none other than God himself who says the strongest things against you. And also, the things he is saying about you are the strongest things that anybody could say about you. So he's the worst. He's the one who is offending you the most. And what he's saying is the most offensive stuff that could be said about you. Does that make sense? He calls you ungodly. Listen to how Paul talks about the ungodly in 1 Timothy. It's the same author. It's a different letter. Same word, ungodly. Listen to who he groups the ungodly with. 1 Timothy 1. Men who practice homosexuality, enslavers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine. That's the group that the ungodly belong to. Being ungodly, as the word might suggest, is to be against God, plain. And by the same token, then, it's for God to be against you. Paul expresses this later in verse 10, chapter 5 of Romans, verse 10. What does he call us? He calls us enemies of God. There's nothing mild about that. An enemy is opposition to you. An enemy is opposed to your very life. He's trying to stop you. It's either his life or yours. That's an enemy, especially in that day and age. That's how Paul feels about the ungodly. That's how God feels about the ungodly. Peter says it this way. Same word, ungodly. In 2 Peter 3. This is what God has in store for the ungodly. By the word of God, the heavens and earth are stored up for fire for the day of judgment and the destruction of the ungodly. How does God feel about the ungodly? He is storing up fire to destroy them. That's what Paul has just called all of us. What happens to the ungodly? They're destroyed by fire. Brothers and sisters, I wonder, do you hear? Do you hear your name? Do you hear yourself being named? That you and I, full of blame, that you and I have no right to God at all. This is the closest I could think of. This is worse. This is like the cosmic version of a father telling his son that he's embarrassed the family name. This is more than that. This is more than just the banishment from that. This is condemnation. This is death. I am God, you are ungodly, and I destroy the ungodly by fire. Think back on just this last week. How was this last week for you before God? Now, some of you might go one of two directions. You might think of some very specific, even significant sins that come to mind quickly. And so from that, you feel the burden of it. You feel the distance that that creates. Others of us, we might actually think back to last week, nothing terrible, pretty normal sin-wise. Even pretty good. I did some good things. And so you feel a little elevated before God. All of that is zeroed out here. All of that is still under the banner ungodly. I'm sure this week was not. No matter how good it was, it could not have been a week of perfect triumph. It could not have been a week of perfect godliness. The people around you, what would they say? If we saw a replay of just your thoughts, what would we say? Godly or ungodly? I wonder, particularly if you're visiting, I wonder if this offends you. If so, I hope that you would consider that at the very least, this is the problem that Christianity is most honest about than every other way of life. Every other explanation of life. Even versions of so-called Christianity will tell you something like, there's actually nothing wrong with you. Everything bad that you think or feel or do, that either doesn't really matter, it's not that bad, or it's somebody else's fault. And so they come across descriptions of us like this. And they have to pretend that it doesn't exist. And they send you on this endless journey of self-discovery and self-improvement, all while keeping your soul in denial of what your soul actually knows deep down. Only Christianity, only the Bible, really tells it like it is. Because, and most especially, because it tells you like you are. It doesn't flinch at the brokenness of the world. It doesn't flinch at all the darkness that you carry. Only the Bible tells you what you're afraid to say about yourself. That you are actually at odds, at odds, alienated from God. And you kind of know it. You know what the trick is to not be offended when somebody tells you about you? Well, there's two possibilities. One, you're a little bit of a sociopath. Or two, you already know. You've already seen it in yourself. As we sang earlier, you sing with your heart, you wonder how he could love me, a sinner condemned and unclean. You know this. The author G.K. Chesterton, he got it right when a newspaper asked the question, what's wrong with the world? He responded famously by writing very briefly, dear sirs, I am. What happened? We became weak and ungodly in the garden. We remain weak and ungodly now. And so we deserve death. That's what happened. What happened then? What happened next? What happened just at the right time, Paul says? What happened was, while we were still weak at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly. Put yourself in ancient Rome for a second. You being in ancient Rome means your whole life has been surrounded by mythology after mythology of countless gods. The very planets in the sky are named after the gods. The constellations that the stars compose are named after gods. They each have a story to tell, how they got the power that they have, how they are ruling and conquering and judging the world. This is your life. This is the great story under which you live. There was a god for everything, in fact. Everything from a god named Portunus, the god of keys and doors, to the goddess Cloacina, who was the goddess of the sewer systems. Very, very vital role. Essential goddess. Your religion touched every part of your life. Your life would then go well or poorly, depending on how happy you made the gods, how much you appeased them. And so you would both privately and publicly at the temple offer sacrifices, attend the festivals, do all sorts of rituals to make sure they were happy, make sure the gods were okay with you. This was so much baked into the Roman life that the emperor himself, starting from Augustine, his other role was chief priest. That was how he was understood. His political and religious power were kind of intermingled. And of course, it wasn't just these essential but minor gods that you had to keep happy. It was really the major ones, wasn't it? It was the gods like Jupiter, the god of thunder. This was the king of the gods. Gods like Mars, the god of war. Lots of battles back then. And they wouldn't just be appeased by your normal sacrifices. What did they do? How did they honor these major gods? They wrote about them. And they put their appearances on money, on buildings, on their armor. And they would often have another description besides their name along with that inscription. What would it say? Often the inscription would be the word Invictus. You know what Invictus means? Invictus means invincible, unconquerable. This is what my god is like. This is how powerful my god is. He will never be defeated. And it's in that cultural, hyper-religious setting that Paul, the Roman citizen, writes, Christ died. This was foolishness. What a pathetic god. What a lame god would die. What kind of god can't vanquish his enemies? What kind of god actually dies for his enemies? That would be the most absurd part of all of this. So many battles, so much bloodshed, so much success, so much conquering, so much gaining, so much owning of dominating the world. This is amazing. Your god did the opposite. What kind of god does that? Of course, the only god that does that is the real one. The only god that does that is the only one. So much so that as Mark tells us in Mark 15, that as a Roman centurion is watching Jesus die, he has to remark, he has to confess, truly, this man was the son of God. Imagine that. He senses the gravity of what's just taken place. He senses the weight of the transaction that has actually happened between heaven and earth as he sees this innocent man die an excruciating death. He realizes his spirit even perhaps is awakened. That's God. That's what a god does. Brothers and sisters, as heavy as Paul lays it on about you and me throughout his letters, not just here, Paul is even more stunned at what he says about God, the son. He says Christ died. He can't even embellish this. The fact of it itself is enough. The fact of Christ's death itself is bigger than the entire world. God, the creator of life, the endless eternal one, he stopped, he died, he lost life. And before we think that, okay, maybe it was just this singular example to follow, this amazing thing that should inspire us now to live. That's all it was. As tremendous as that would be, nothing could be more inspiring than that. Paul makes it clear as he continues. It's not just that Christ died. What did Christ do? Christ died for us. Not just before us, for us, for you. He died for us, meaning he died instead of us. Friends, that's the only way you and I are saved, if Jesus dies instead of you. Why? God can't let sin slide. It's an essential aspect of God's holiness. If he lets sin slide, that means his holiness is the weak thing. His holiness is not powerful. His holiness is not total and complete and perfect and pure. Sin has to be punished. Sin has to be eliminated. And you can't, you and I can't undo our sin before him. And so the only solution, the only solution that doesn't end the whole world is if his sinless son, the only one for whom no sacrifice needs to be made on his behalf, because he's perfect, if that sinless sacrifice is sacrificed for you, a sinful one, that's the only way your ledger gets clean, by being replaced. You can't wipe it yourself. There's no amount that you can do to counteract what's already there. It just has to be swapped out. That's what Jesus does. When Christ died instead of you, Christ was, in fact, spiritually replacing you. He was the righteous one, stepping in for you, the sinful. He was the strong one, stepping in for you, the weak. He, God the Son, dying for the ungodly. Nothing short of that. Nothing less. No two more opposite things could be, have ever been put together, have ever had any relationship than God dying for man. And it wasn't a death that was just physical, as gruesome a death as the crucifixion was. God's wrath against you and me is spiritual wrath. It's a rejection of your soul. So the only way we're saved is if Jesus takes God's wrath upon his own soul, not just his body. By him feeling, spiritually, the full darkness of God's spiritual denial. In other words, he experienced hell. So that you would be saved from hell. He died for you. I heard somebody use an illustration kind of like this. It's like if a fireman was called to put out a fire, and it turns out it's his own house. And so he puts it out and he rescues his family. But then he finds out that the fire was actually caused by arson, and they have the criminal in custody. And so the fireman goes to the trial, and he decides, I'll serve the time for him. What? That doesn't make any sense. That's absurd. That's totally not necessary. Justice is being done here. Don't worry about it. No, no, no. I'll take it for him. Christ died for the ungodly. Christ has done far more than that, than even that. Christ didn't just die for us. He died for us. He died for you. He says it more exactly at the end of verse 8. He died for us. He died, meaning he died knowing who he was dying for. He died for us, not the most brilliant. He didn't like reserve it for the most promising people, the most attractive, the most impressive in any way. No, he died so that no one could boast. He was dying for who? He was dying for those of us who were still weak. He died for those of us who were still sinners, not up and up, not improving, not cleaning up our act, not even knowing better. He was dying for you. My friend, I ask, are you a sinner today? Are you a sinner today? That is a yes or no question, and there's only one answer. It's yes. Then the good news is that Christ died for you. If you're a sinner, do you know that? You get to take the ticket of receiving Christ's death for you. While you were still sinning, while you were still ungodly, while you were fully living up to your nature, Christ died for you. I don't know why, but when he died for you, when he died for you, it wasn't, as I can often feel, it wasn't just for some vague sense of your fallenness. It wasn't for the occasionally large sins that you commit, and then otherwise your vague sense of weakness, your vague sense of imperfection, of knowing you could be better, but okay, that's fine. No, no, no. Christ died for your literal exact sins. All your sins is what Christ died for. Every moment of ungodliness, all your small thoughts of him and all your wrong thoughts of your neighbor, all your big thoughts about yourself, all of your selfishness, all of your lusts, all of your mistakes, all of your lies, all that you wish could be just taken off of your record, all you really hope nobody ever finds out about you, that's what Christ died for, your sins. All of them. All of them. Every one. Every one. Every single one. That, yep, that, the one you forget, yep, that, all of it. Destroyed. As Jesus' life, as Jesus' body was destroyed, they were destroyed with him. The Welsh preacher Martin Lloyd-Jones said it like this, Christ does not save us by his life. He does not save us by his teaching. He does not save us by his example. All those are of glorious and of inestimable value, but he does not save us by them. In order to save us, he had to die. My friend, do you know that? My friend, have you felt the comfort and power of blood shed for you, for your actual sins, for the sins you will commit today? What happened? What happened then, finally? Why it happened at all? Why did this happen? You know, we know the gospel and we can kind of get used to this, but it turns out people don't actually die for one another that often. That's not a common thing. Paul says as much. He gives that example in verse 7. You know, you might scarcely die for a righteous person. You might even dare to die for a good person. What does he mean? A righteous person is somebody upright, somebody respectable, somebody honorable, somebody whose life you feel like, you know, their example should continue in the world. And you know what? If they're facing some unjust death penalty, yeah, I might consider actually stepping in for them. Their life would be worth it to continue, to protect. What's a good person? A good person, more personally, might be a person that's actually been good to you. The word actually might be describing a benefactor, somebody who's given something significant to you or supporting you along the way of life. If that person, if somebody who you know, who you've personally benefited from, if that person is on death row unjustly, you might be a little more inclined to step in. But even then, what's Paul's point? Paul's point is this rarely happens. That's a lot to give. That's certainly a lot to ask. That's a lot to give. My life? You're amazing, and I will talk about you a lot. I will tell my family about you, but God be with you. How much more than is God's love for you, for you who is not a righteous person, who is certainly not a good person to him, you've certainly not given anything to God that he hasn't given you? How much more is God's love for you that he would still send his son to die for you? Not even himself. Something in a way more precious. His only son to die for you. Nobody dies for anybody. God did it. Why did all of this happen? Why did Christ die for us? Christ died for us because, as Paul says in verse 8, it's because God loves us. Christ died for you because God loves you. You. He actually loves you. We'll never get to the bottom of that. You can't look at the son of God hanging on a cross, innocently taking on flesh, enduring all temptation in his life, and then ultimately dying. That's breathtaking enough. There's no more shocking reversal of things. There's no more opposite ends of a spectrum possible. We look at that, and then we add the fact that this is happening because God the Father loves me, loves you. You reach the limit of your words. You reach the limit of metaphor. All we can do. And the only way you can ever respond to pure love is to simply believe it's true. Isn't that true? What's the best way to respond to pure love? Not love that's transactional, not love that's looking to get something back, not love that's counting. Pure, free love. It's to believe it. It's to receive it, isn't it? Will you believe it's true? Will you believe it's true that God loves you? You might be sitting there saying, it's too good to be true. I can't believe something that amazing. It's too big. It's too big to just believe. What do you mean? You're absolutely right. That's why God himself must help you believe. That's why we can't really conjure enough of what we think would be an adequate amount of belief to hold on to this. God has to stir this in you. God has to help you come alongside you to help you believe. You need to ask him to help you. You need to give all your sin to him in your heart and you need to see it poured upon his son. You need to see your sins, all of them, poured upon Jesus on the cross and then see God's love poured upon you. And what you'll see is that it's not that God's love gets smaller. It's not that God's love gets more manageable so that you can believe it a little more easily. It's that it gets bigger and it gets bigger so that it can envelop all of your doubts, all of your hesitation, all of your weakness, all of your worry, all of your sin even. Because God, God really loves you. He really does. I'm not making it up. I wouldn't. What a cruel thing. But it's true. Do you believe it? I'll close with this from J.I. Packer, recently deceased Anglican theologian. And he writes in a way that's maybe even a little more tender than he tends to write from his book Knowing God. What matters supremely, therefore, is not, in the last analysis, the fact that I know God. He's saying what matters most is not that I know God. What matters is the larger fact that underlies it, the fact that he knows me. I am graven on the palms of his hands. I am never out of his mind. All my knowledge of him depends on his sustained initiative in knowing me. I know him because he first knew me and he continues to know me. He knows me as a friend, one who loves me. There is no moment when his eye is off me, no moment where his attention is distracted from me, no moment, therefore, when his care for me falters. This is momentous knowledge and unspeakable comfort. This is fascinating, so well said. There is tremendous relief in knowing that his love for me is utterly realistic, meaning it's based on every knowledge of the worst about me so that no discovery now can disillusion him about me as I am so often disillusioned about myself and so quench his determination to bless me. Did you catch that? It's a tremendous relief in knowing that God's love for you, it's not fanciful, it's not made up, it's not TV, it's not fiction in any way. It is utterly realistic because it has seen, it knows every moment of your life and it's based on every knowledge of the worst about you so that anything that were to happen now in your life is not going to jeopardize anything. It was already accounted for and he still chose to love you. There's nothing more realistic than that. Nobody in your life knows you and loves you as realistically as that. We have God who loves us like that. And so we do wonder when we consider what happened, we wonder how he could love us, sinners, condemned and unclean. And then when we keep reading, then we stand amazed as the hymn goes, then we can sing, how marvelous, how wonderful, my song shall ever be how marvelous, how wonderful is my Savior's love for me. May that more and more be the song of our hearts. Let's pray. Father, it is impossible as I feel now, it's impossible to do justice to what you want to convey to us. It's impossible to express what it is, the wonder of you loving us, loving us to the degree that you would send your son to die, not for friends but for enemies. What can we say? God, we say thank you. God, we say help us see and help us believe that by believing we might enjoy you as we ought and that by enjoying you, we might freely love those you've put in our lives. Would you do that work even now by your spirit? In Christ's name, amen.
