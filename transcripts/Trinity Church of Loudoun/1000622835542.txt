The 1987 movie, Babette's Feast. Bet you didn't know that's where I was going. It's a, I think it's a Danish movie. It tells the story of an 18th century Christian community in Denmark that's become joyless and legalistic. And Babette is the name of a Parisian refugee who stumbles upon this community in Denmark and she comes to live, she's heard about this church and she comes to live with these two sisters who are the daughters of the pastor of this dwindling congregation. She's here to serve them. So for 12 years, she serves as their housekeeper and she mainly prepares their very meager, very bland meals for the sisters and for the congregation to enjoy. And after 12 years of doing this, one day she hears that she's won 10,000 francs or francs, if you like. She had a, again, she's from Paris and she'd had a friend back in Paris every year renew her lottery ticket in Paris. And this year, she won, her number was called. And so hearing this, Babette, loving her community, asks if she can prepare a banquet for this body of believers. And now this church, again, they're a little, their hearts are a little cold. They've not actually learned to enjoy things freely in God for a long time. So they reluctantly agree to have her cook for them. And so after lots of preparation, she serves up this beautiful seven course meal, exquisite food, food that they've never seen before. They'd never even heard of this stuff. Baby quail can be eaten. And it's to the degree that a general who was visiting, who had just come to town and happened to be there when this meal was being served, he exclaims that he's only ever tasted food this good at the famous Cafe Anglaise in Paris. And as the meal continues and it unfolds, the community you see starts to rediscover joy. This meal breathes life into this community. Feuds are ended, sin is confessed, and the evening ends with the community hand in hand around the village fountain, singing old songs of faith. Meanwhile, the two sisters, they find Babette back in the kitchen in the chaos of all the pots and pans that she's used. And with a distant look in her eyes, she says, I was once the chef at Cafe Anglaise. Cafe Anglaise. The sisters say, we will all remember this evening when you've gone back to Paris. But Babette tells them she will not be returning because the whole meal cost 10,000 francs. She's staying with them. I've not seen that movie, but I read that description. And I thought it'd be a good intro for today. Look forward to seeing it, though it's probably not in English. A good meal, as a lot of us have experienced, a good meal doesn't just feed, does it? A good meal satisfies. A good meal doesn't just nourish. A good meal can heal wounds. A good meal doesn't just take time to prepare and to enjoy. A good meal stays with you. If you haven't already, you can turn to Psalm 23. We've been looking at this famous chapter a few times now. This will be our third and I believe final time. And we will be, as you've probably noticed, we will be looking at a meal that David is describing in the psalm. But before that, a little reintroduction to the psalm. It's been at least a few weeks. What have we seen? What is happening? What is the psalm about? Psalm 23, most of you have known it, maybe even memorized it. It's a psalm of David, but where it's located in the Psalter is interesting. It's informative at the very least. It's in the middle of a set of psalms that David has written that are all about the kingship, starting from Psalm 20. In Psalm 20, in brief, David is confident that God is with him as the king. So the whole psalm is expressing God is with me, God is gonna provide for me. Psalm 21, he again expresses similar feelings. He trusts that God is gonna more specifically save him from his enemies. So he knows as king, there's gonna be threats to his throne, people, other rulers wanting to take over power of his land. God's gonna save me against them. So Psalm 20, confident, God's with me. 21, God's gonna save me against my enemies. He's gonna hold me up. And then Psalm 22, right out of the gate, David laments, God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why have you forsaken me? I cry by day, but you don't answer. At night, I find no rest. These are the opening verses of Psalm 22. After all that confidence, after all that show of strength, God has forsaken him. He says, enemies have surrounded him. He says in verse 14, so much so, this is the condition of his inner man. Verse 14, my heart is like wax. My strength is dried up. You lay me in the dust of death. That's quite a rollercoaster of emotions. The king, triumphant, just a couple chapters ago, experiencing green pastures, you might say, now is desperate in chapter 22. Feels the shadow of death, you might say. And through that, David has to remind himself, as he's sitting in the gloom, as he's sitting in the wonder and confusion of where God has gone, through that, with everything still real around him, worrying him, he has to get to the fact that it's still gonna be okay by getting to verse 28. 28 of Psalm 22, he confesses, he realizes, he remembers kingship belongs to the Lord, parentheses, not to him. It's the Lord who rules. It's the Lord who is to be praised. And no matter what, if all things belong to the Lord, including his own kingship, that means no matter what, the Lord is the one in control. God is in control, in triumph or failure. That's the attitude that we see carry over into Psalm 23. It's not just this comforting jingle in a vacuum. It's situated for a reason there, to show us how we get to a place, how a king like David gets to a place where he confesses from the beginning of a Psalm in the middle of songs about being the king, he says, the Lord is my shepherd. Nothing about him being the king. David's confessing that he isn't simply this king ruling on God's behalf. He's not this superman between God and the people he's ruling. He's realized through what he's experienced that he is just like a sheep himself. He's needy, he can't take care of himself, he has terrible vision, he's pretty dumb, like all the sheep that he once had to take care of as a shepherd, he sees his reflection now. So as we take a look at the Psalm once more, I wanna ask us, where has God taken you in your life? Where has God taken you in your life? Where has God brought you now, today? Do you see yourself as you examine where God has brought you? Do you see yourself as God's sheep, having been led by him to these places, having been led out of certain places by him? Maybe you've had a actually pretty easy life so far. Not too many hardships, a lot of pastures, a lot of still waters God's blessed you with. Who do you attribute that to? Who gets the credit for that? Is that all from how you've taken care of yourself? How you've been wise in your dealings? My friends, if that's you, you need to know that God has given you all of your days. God has given you everything you have. Or maybe you look back at your life and you mainly see hardships, actually. That there've been a lot of valleys, the valleys have been deep. You're not sure how many times you've really nudged up to the clouds. You've felt the shadow of death. My friends, if that's you, I wonder, in the shadows, have you also seen God's shadow? Have you also seen him show you through the darkness that having him is still better than having the version of your life that you want? Have you seen how God has used the hardships of your life to reveal, to shed light upon the fact that it is better to have him than to have the best version of life you think? Hasn't he used that to do that? The Lord is our shepherd in both plenty and in loss. At the end of the day, every sheep needs a shepherd. You and I need a shepherd. And so, as we've been discussing, the psalm is about how the Lord shepherds us through the pastures and the valleys because that's the way home. And today, we'll be looking at that last phrase, the way home. The psalm ends with David in a house. Well, what is happening in this house? Verse five, verse five and six. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil. My cup overflows. Surely, goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Well, two headings for these two verses. First, a lavish feast and an eternal home. A lavish feast and an eternal home. Verse five, a lavish feast. I don't know if you noticed this or maybe you've seen this before as you've considered this psalm. David changes the metaphor on us. Totally without warning, he just changes the metaphor. He shifts here from sheep and shepherd to more like a guest and a host. You notice that? Why does he do that? Some actually argue he doesn't, then they try to stretch the sheep-shepherd metaphor across these last two verses. I think that's kind of silly or unnecessary. You don't lose anything by reading the verses as they are clearly, more clearly demonstrated. Why does he change the metaphor? I think it's for a pretty good reason, actually. What's he been saying for these first four verses? Obviously, he's been describing himself and God as being in a sheep and shepherd relationship. After four verses of showing how he's like a sheep under God's care, after four verses of showing the journey that a shepherd takes sheep on from pastures down to the valleys and all the way home, David changes the metaphor because the metaphor isn't good enough anymore. The metaphor isn't good enough anymore. Yes, of course, God does treat us like a shepherd treats sheep, but at the end of the day, what we need to see is that he ultimately treats us far better than shepherds treat their sheep. He treats us far better than sheep could ever comprehend they're being treated. Sheep understand needing food and water, of course. Sheep understand needing shelter. They understand being afraid. What they don't understand, that David is getting at, what they don't understand is lavishness. Sheep don't understand lavishness. They don't understand when they have more than enough. Humans do. You and I do. We understand getting far more than we need, having far more than we need. Think about the most lavish experience you've ever had. What comes to mind? One way to think about it would be just thinking about the fanciest place you've ever been. The fanciest restaurant, fanciest hotel, maybe. Things that are gold-plated that don't need to be gold-plated. That's one way of experiencing lavishness, isn't it? Fanciness. But there's a better way to experience lavishness. There's a more powerful way to experience lavishness, isn't there? It's more powerful when it's done for you personally. Not when it's done for anybody generally. It's powerful when you yourself are lavished upon. When someone gives you something generous out of their specific care for you. That's lavishing that can't be bought. That other stuff, you have to pay for that. This lavishing, it would be insulting if you tried to pay. Have you experienced that kind of lavishing? Personal lavishing. That's the sense that David's getting at here. He's starting to describe the invitation to God's house, and that is an understanding that sheep cannot comprehend. He needs to change the metaphor. David has more than he could ever need. His cup is overflowing, he says. You catch that language? Goodness and mercy will surely follow him all the days of his life, he says. And you also notice, like he starts in verse four, he's not talking about God, right? He's not speaking about God in the third person. He, he says you. He says you and I, me. He says you prepare a table before me. My friends, we can go about the Christian life stiff-arming God. We can believe all the right things on paper. We can confess and even sing them loudly every week, but emotionally, in a sense of being invulnerable to the language that the Bible gives us, we can keep him at a distance. This is David obliterating that. The God of heaven and earth prepares a table before me. You do that for me. Have you ever, has that ever been your language or your understanding of God's care for you? Or does that feel a little too close, a little too presumptuous? Not according to God's own word. This is what we're invited to. He isn't just God's sheep anymore. Remember, sheep have to stay outside at the end of the day, right? They can't come in. David is now God's personal guest. David's now God's personal, he's eating at his dining table. Sheep can't do that. And after all, of course, it is meals at the end of the day that tend to capture lavishness, aren't they? How much has the host prepared? How abundantly, how thoughtfully? It all comes out in the meal, doesn't it? One way or another. We should keep in mind how in the ancient Near East, hospitality was a big deal. Maybe you've heard about this. Probably to this day, that's the case. It was an essential act of blessing. And for the Jews, it was actually like part of their law. It was part of their law so that they would remember that they themselves were once sojourners and strangers, relying on other people and living on other people's land. So that they might remember that, they were commanded to treat others with that understanding. And so every guest, especially strangers, especially those just traveling through, passing through, they were treated as honored guests. And every guest eventually will get hungry. So what do you serve a hungry, honored guest? Not leftovers. Not pizza, for some of you who've been to my house and been subjected to pizza. I mean, honestly, that's probably better than my best, so I mean, maybe I pass. You don't serve leftovers. You don't serve what little you have. You serve your best. And you serve more than enough of it. That's how you treat honored guests. Think of Abraham, we saw this a number of weeks ago as Matt was preaching through Genesis. Abraham, when he greets the three men who are embodying God, Genesis 18, he's never seen them before, but it says they were in the heat of the day and he sees them approaching. So what does he do? When he sees them, he doesn't even stay seated for them to get to him. It says he runs after them. He runs after them. He urges them to stay. He says, let me get you water for your feet. And then he dashes in, gets his servant, gets Sarah, has them make cakes, arranges for milk to be brought. He has a whole calf prepared for these three men to eat. A whole calf for three men to eat. Abraham's lavishing them. Abraham is preparing a table before them. That's the thinking behind how hospitality was supposed to look back in the day. Lavishing. So when David says, God, you have prepared a table for me. God, you are hosting me. Can you imagine the kind of reception David has in mind? This is David, a king who would have hosted visitors himself many times. Rolled out the red carpet many times. God, though, is preparing a table. I remember watching the movie Hook as a kid. I did watch this movie. Came out in 1991, long time ago. And if you've seen it, you may already guess where I'm going as far as the scene I'll talk about. It's when Peter Pan, he meets Rufio and the Lost Boys. Remember them? And they're all sitting down at this long table for dinner. Except when dinner arrives, somehow steaming, it's all a bunch of empty pots and pans. They open it all and it's just steam. There's nothing in them. But the boys start digging in. They use their own bowls to scoop up nothing. They use their hands to grab pretend food. Rufio grabs what looks like a turkey leg. Another guy, he's acting like he's eating the biggest burger in the world, like slowly. They're pretending like they're eating this incredible meal and Peter doesn't understand what's happening until he and Rufio start arguing with each other. They trade insults and then he flicks his spoon at Rufio and what happens? Magically, some food splats onto Rufio's face and all the chattering stops. I might be ruining this. One of the best scenes of the movie, I'm sorry, but you're way too late at this point. All the chatter stops at the table and all the kids turn to Peter. What do they say? Peter, you're doing it. Peter, you're believing. And the camera slowly pans back and you see suddenly the whole table now populated full of the food that they were all imagining. Meats and cheeses and fruits and cakes, more than they could ever finish. Once Peter started believing, it was like the food was there the whole time and it ends up being the greatest meal of his life. That's kind of like the picture David is drawing us here. Do you know what God is preparing for you? Do you know how much God has for you? Do you believe that what God has for you is richer and fuller than anything anybody else could ever give? Anything that anyone else could ever lavish upon you, he exceeds that, he's God. A couple of things to consider about coming to God's table. First, feasts are meant to be unhurried. Feasts are meant to be unhurried, aren't they? If you're an adult, you've come to know that there's a general inverse relationship between how long you've been in a relationship and there's a general inverse relationship between how long food takes to get to you and how good it is, generally. So a full course homemade meal takes forever is the best. Maybe somewhere around here you have like Panera. And then you have the drive-thru, right? Well, then you have the microwave right here. The best stuff takes time. And it's meant to take you time to enjoy. And if you're a guest, a feast means that you're being invited to stay a while. This took a long time to prepare. The meal needed to be planned, the house needed to be prepared, the table needed to be set, the ingredients needed to be gathered, the crops needed to be harvested, the animals needed to be butchered and cleaned. A lot had to happen. And as you arrive, you actually start to smell it before you even see it. And it's finally brought out to the table and there's hardly any space left and each plate looks better than the last one. This is a feast, this is a feast. And so no, you don't sit down and just eat as fast as you can and leave. That would be ridiculous. You take your time, you savor each course, you talk with the other guests, you linger a while, you unbutton things and you marvel at how all of this could have been done for you. How all of this for me, prepared for me? If we don't get there, we don't get moved is the point. So we need to ask, what does this look like with God? What does it look like to be unhurried before God and all that He prepares for us? In our day and age, when we always feel like there's so much to do, when we are trying to multitask as much as we can, when we have all our interests at the tip of our fingertips on demand, being at God's table looks like having unhurried time in the day when you are doing nothing but enjoying Him. Just saying very practically, what does it look like to enjoy being at God's table with Him, to receive His goods prepared for you? Unhurried time in your day that is spent doing nothing but enjoying Him. Maybe that's an hour, maybe that's a half hour, maybe that's 10 minutes. If every one of us in here spent 10 minutes of unhurried time doing nothing but enjoying God, our church would be different because you and I would be different. Why is that so hard for us? One writer gave her take, this is actually in the form of Psalm 23, it's called Psalm 23 Antithesis. The clock is my dictator. You'll hear the echo. My clock, the clock is my dictator, I shall not rest. My clock, the clock is my dictator, I shall not rest. It makes me lie down only when exhausted. It leads me into deep depression. It hounds my soul. It leads me in circles of frenzy for activity's sake. Even though I run frantically from task to task, I will never get it all done for my ideal is with me. Deadlines and my need for approval, they drive me. They demand performance from me beyond the limits of my schedule. They anoint my head with migraines. My inbox overflows. Surely fatigue and time pressure shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the bonds of frustration forever. You ever feel that way? Do you always feel that way? We can convince ourselves, especially living in the area we live in, we can convince ourselves that feeling busy is a virtue. Being busy is a virtue. Always, calendar's full, don't have time for you, don't have time to, it's not a virtue. The more we see ourselves as needing to be busy, the more our attention is gonna be spent on all the things we feel need to get done, which means the less attention you're gonna pay to God and your soul. It's just how it works. Soren Kierkegaard here is a Danish philosopher. He put it this way. The result of busyness is that an individual very seldom is permitted to form a heart. The result of busyness is that an individual is very seldom permitted to form a heart. Do you see that at all in you? Do you see that in our world a little bit? Another author calls it the strange mix of busyness and lifelessness. Haven't you felt that? In a world that welcomes us every day, every day we are welcomed to be busier and busier, doing more of this and more of that, adding this, doing this, doing this to make that easier and faster, add, add, add, add, hollowing ourselves out. In this world, we need to form hearts, my friends. And we do that by spending unhurried time with God. We do that by going to his table, seeing what he's laid out for us and enjoying. That's the first thing, feasts should be unhurried. Second thing about God's table, this feast is a feast of victory and peace. This is a feast of victory and peace. When you hosted somebody in this day and age, you weren't just signing up to give them room and board. You might remember this from Lot's unfortunate story. When the angels come to his house, he doesn't just have them stay with them. When they're threatened by the men of the city, what does he do? He unbelievably sacrifices his own daughters, offers them at least. What is he doing? He's expressing how when somebody came and became a guest in your house, you were also responsible for their safety to protect them. You had to now protect them as if they were one of your own, even more so in some cases. That explains David's confidence here. He knows it's not just some lavish meal in store for him, right? That's fantastic. I'll never forget that, but you need a little more in life, don't you? David knows that it's not just food. He's also granted a complete protection from harm. If he's in God's house, nobody and nothing can touch him. So much so that he goes ahead and he, there's the fascinating picture that he paints in verse five. He assumes that his enemies have been captured. Not only that, what are they being forced to do? His enemies are being forced to watch him eat of this feast. This is what a strange picture he's suddenly painted for us. He's sitting there enjoying what God has prepared for him. Who's watching? Who's before him? His enemies. He's taking his time at this table full of food, his cup overflowing, and there are people in chains over there. Just imagine this. What a bizarre, even like twisted picture. There's a sense of insult. There's a sense of rubbing it in here that David's showing us. This is a feast of victory. This is not just a meal. This is not just a celebration of a birthday. This is we conquered. This is our enemies do not threaten us anymore. Do you hear the shift from chapter 22 where David was fearful of the enemies surrounding him? His heart melted like wax, he said. Now he is looking over, I don't know, pork roast, pork roast, and seeing, well, probably not, something cow related. I don't know. Goat, goat. He's looking over just piles of goat. Chicken, all right, chicken. And he sees over there at the far end of the room his enemies not eating, chained, perhaps headed to prison. Perhaps this is their last look of a free life, what the life that they're missing out on. We see, we see this further when we understand the other metaphor he uses. He says he anoints my head with oil, right? This is not an anointing like kings would be anointed for kingship. This is a different kind of anointing. This is the kind of anointing that Jesus is talking about in Luke 7. In Luke 7, Jesus is at a Pharisee's home and the sinful woman shows up and starts to wash his feet with her tears and then pour ointment, valuable ointment on his feet. And as the Pharisees watched this happen, speechless, stunned that he would let this sinful woman touch his feet, he rebukes the Pharisees. How does he do it? He says, when I walked in, you gave me no oil to anoint my head. This woman has anointed my feet. What's he saying? She welcomed me better than you did. This was oil that would have been given to guests or people passing through, travelers, oil that would have been scented for them to be refreshed after being outside in the sweat and the debris and the mud. So that kind of oil is an oil of welcome. An oil of hospitality. And so for David to say, you have anointed, you've set your table before me, you've anointed me with oil, my cup is overflowing. He's saying, I am totally welcome in this house. The enemies here, these are powerless compared to that. What does this look like in our lives? I trust that most of us don't have enemies like David might have. Trust that we don't have people who are after us or trying to take us down or end our lives even. But the question isn't so much, who are your enemies? That's not the point, right? It's what those enemies represented to David. The question for us is, what do you fear? What makes your life feel at risk? And try to answer that. What makes your life feel at risk, feel shaky? That if it goes a little more in this direction, uh-oh, bottoms out. What is that in your life? That's the reality. That's what has you. That's what turns your heart into wax. The picture David is painting for all of us then, all of us who have our own enemies that cause fear in us, the picture he's painting, almost cartoonish picture he's painting, right? Is that when God brought you into his home, when God brought you a seat at his table, those things you're afraid of, those things you're worried about, those dangers might as well be in chains. They are powerless. Not because they're illegitimate, not because you're making them up or exaggerating them, but because none of them can actually threaten the most precious, the most important thing that you do have, which is God. You have God. You lose your job, you still have God. You lose your health, you still have God. You lose your reputation, your possessions, even your loved ones, you lose your dreams. Do you have God or not? Full stop. You have God to overflowing. No matter how outsized your worries or your fears or your enemies may be, you have God in front of them. We see a picture of this, I think in Acts 16, you might know the story. I'll read a portion of that chapter, but just to set it up, Paul and Silas, classic Acts characters, they're in Philippi and they're on their way to a prayer, a place of prayer, and they come across this woman, a slave girl, who's possessed by an evil spirit. And she starts telling everybody, hey, they're here to preach the gospel, they're here to preach the gospel. And it says, Paul got so, it literally says, he got so annoyed that he turned around and cast the demon out. Fascinating way to express annoyance. Like assuming, no, that you're literally from the devil. That's how annoying you are. And the problem was this slave girl earned a lot of money by being possessed and therefore having a spirit that could tell fortunes. So her owners would deploy her to go be a fortune teller and rake in a lot of cash for them. Now that's no longer the case. She doesn't know what's happening a minute from now. And so they get mad, they drag Paul and Silas into the marketplace, they start accusing them of causing a ruckus and the whole crowd joins in and eventually they're beaten with rods, they're flogged and then they're thrown in jail. For what? Exactly, but they're thrown in jail. So what's the picture? Two believers, done nothing wrong, they've lost their rights, they've lost their ministry, they've lost their plans, whatever their plans were, they've lost a lot and they don't know what's beyond. How do they respond? How do they respond? Acts 16, 25. About midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God and the other prisoners were listening to them. First of all, just to even stop there, when's the last time you turned to singing when you're in trouble? When you've really lost like everything that you could imagine losing? When's the last time you turned to singing? Try that, just try it, it worked for these guys. Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once all the prison doors flew open and everyone's chains came loose. The jailer woke up and when he saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped. Paul shouted, don't harm yourself, we're all here. The jailer called for lights. He rushed in and he fell trembling before Paul and Silas. He then brought them out and asked, sirs, what must I do to be saved? I've been watching you, I've been listening to your songs and your prayers. I know what happened, I know what they did to you. I participated, I've made sure you stayed in here. What is wrong with you? Why aren't you worried now? Why do you wanna save my life? What must I do to be like you? What must I do to have what you have? They replied, believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, you and your household. Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house. At that hour of the night, the jailer took them and washed their wounds. Then immediately he and all his household were baptized. The jailer then brought them into his house and set a meal before them. He was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God, he and his whole household. What does confidence in the face of your enemies look like? What does peace in the face of losing everything look like? Like that. And in this case, their enemy becomes their brother and prepares a table before them. Isn't that fascinating? Charles Spurgeon put it like this. When a soldier is in the presence of his enemies, if he eats at all, he snatches a hasty meal and away he hastens to the fight. But here, this feast is on a peaceful occasion. Nothing is hurried. There's no confusion, no disturbance. The enemy is near and yet God prepares a table and the Christian can sit down and eat as if everything were in perfect peace. Oh, the peace which Jehovah gives to his people, even in the midst of the most trying circumstances. So think again, where has God taken you in your life? What trying circumstances has he brought you to? Maybe even now. Can you sense, can you look for, can you peer into the fact that God in the midst of that, in the midst of that, the more you see him as the one who's brought you, the more you see him as the one who's prepared your table, the more you see him as the one who is in full control of all your enemies, that in the midst of your hardest circumstance, peace is still offered to you. Peace is still on hand for you. It's the lavish feast. Secondly, and more briefly, we also see an eternal home. Verse six, once more. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Again, if we weren't so used to this psalm, we'd be, I think, amazed at this declaration. It's an amazing declaration. David's declared three things about himself now in this psalm, starting with I. These are all related things. These are all things that we can declare for ourselves. Verse one, what does he say? I shall lack nothing. Verse four, I will fear no evil. And now finally, verse six, I shall dwell in the house of Yahweh forever. Why does he finish with this? Why is this the conclusion? Feast was pretty good, right? Vivid picture of what God provides, vivid picture of abundance, even peace amidst hardships. David doesn't conclude here, doesn't conclude there at the feast, because once again, the metaphor isn't good enough. The picture of a feast still doesn't tell the full story. Just like sheep didn't give a full enough picture, a feast doesn't give a full enough picture of what it means to be invited into God's house forever. Not even a feast this extraordinary. Why is that the case? Why can't a feast capture exactly what David wants to say? Why can't it capture more of what it means to live in God's house? Why is that? Because even the most expansive, most luxurious, leisurely feasts end. Thanksgiving ends. Sometime in December, the leftovers end. The festivals in the Bible, tremendous celebrations of God's work throughout the history of God's people, some days, others, weeks long, end. Some day. As amazing, as meaningful as they are, they end, and where does everyone have to go? They gotta go back home. So what David is saying is that the feast is great, victory is great, peace is great, but here's the greatest part. God is letting me stay. I don't have to leave. Yahweh has welcomed me, not just as a dinner guest for a night. He's welcomed me now as a member of his family. He's made room for me forever. It's far better than the most lavish feast. You ever see those videos of parents telling their foster child that they're gonna adopt them? Just absolutely brutal. It's almost always like Christmas, too. Their opening presents and the whole symbolism thing, it just, totally, no defense against that. The kid can't believe his luck, right? Kid can't say, yes, fast enough. Yes, I want that. Yes, thank you. Yes, I love you. That's the thrill that David is trying to capture here. The blessing that exceeds anything that he could have possibly imagined for himself. So much so that, look at how he describes being part of God's house. All that he can say, all the words he knows to say are, it's like goodness and mercy are following me everywhere. What in your life could you describe that way? What has to be so good? What could make you that happy, amaze you that much for you to say, yeah, it's like I can't get away from goodness and mercy? That's what he's saying. That's how good this is. When you live in God's house, you can trust that goodness and mercy will never end. When it says they follow me all the days, the word follow there isn't that wherever I go, I leave some goodness and mercy behind me. The word is pursue. Goodness and mercy are after me. They search me out. They find me. They're always nearby. I can't shake them. They're always there. What a feeling. It's the complete opposite now of his experience from Psalm 22, right? Now that he lives with God, not only are the enemies no longer after him, but goodness and mercy are after him now. You see that? It's not just that the enemy has been neutralized. It's that good things, the goodness of God is after him. Those are not the same thing, friends. You can have one without the other. We get both. What does this mean? How do we dwell then in the house of the Lord? We got to come to church every day? Should we all move in here together? No. I'm glad nobody amended that. That would have been trouble. Why? Because God does not live in a house. God's house is not a house, you could say. Paul tells us in Acts 17, God is Lord of heaven and earth and he does not live in temples made by man. When David wrote this Psalm, by the way, the temple didn't even exist. Think about that. If it's talking about the house of the Lord dwelling, we immediately assume, all right, temple, go to worship all the time. Nope, temple didn't exist. The tabernacle did, but that's kind of getting at the point. How do we live with God forever? We go to the one who came to live with us. When John describes Jesus' birth in his gospel, he says the word became flesh and dwelt among us. The word he uses for dwelt there is the Greek word for tabernacle. The word tabernacled. The word became God's house among us. The word became God's dwelling place among us. John signals that God's dwelling place, the place God can be found, the place where man can go and live with him forever, is this man, Jesus. Jesus is the place. This Jesus who said they could destroy the temple and he would raise it back in three days. This is the true temple where if you've never placed your sins, your sins can go, all of them. The temple was where they sacrificed for the sins of the people. It was never enough. How could you possibly pay for all your sins? The answer is Jesus Christ, an eternal perfect sacrifice. If you've yet to place your trust in him, which is to say, if you've yet to say, you get all my sins then, I know I'm kind of screwed if I have to keep any of these, if I have to hang on to any of these, if any one of these stay on me, I'm done. If you've yet to see and say you can take them, the sacrifice on you, the temple, on you, the altar, is enough, that's what's on offer for us. That is the good news, that the dwelling place of God, the place that you and I are invited to live in is made hospitable for us by the loss of God's son. We get to be God's sons and daughters because God's son himself excavated that role. And amazingly, when we make our home in him, he makes our home in us. That those who dwell in him, God dwells in them. That's why God calls his body the church. He calls the church the temple of God. So we can say this building is not the house of the Lord. These walls do not compose the house of the Lord. We are the house of the Lord. Brothers and sisters, the Lord shepherds us in the pastures and in the valleys, no less, because that's the way home. And his home is forever for all who will find their home in Jesus, God's son. Let's pray. Father, we thank you for your word. We thank you for the riches of your word that we can only begin to mine and discover, that we can only begin to even understand, much less adopt for our lives. But God, we ask that by your spirit, you would in fact help us, help us to believe more, help us to know more clearly, help us to treasure these things and treasure you much more than we do now, that we might genuinely not just know, but that we would delight in who you are and what you've prepared for us and who you are in our lives, that we would see that truly you are better than we currently understand, and that we would follow that instinct to see that it is indeed only goodness and mercy for those who are in you. Father, we thank you that even as we sang earlier, that you have called us precious daughters and treasured sons, that we are called to feast forever on a love beyond our time, because you are glorious Father, Son, and Spirit now with man, with us are intertwined. God, help us to find more and more of our home in you. It's in the name of your Son who dwelt among us, we pray. Amen. Let's.
