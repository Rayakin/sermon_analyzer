The Mighty One, God the Lord, speaks and summons the earth, from the rising of the sun to its setting. Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines forth. Our God comes, he does not keep silence. Before him is a devouring fire, around him a mighty tempest. He calls to the heavens above and to the earth that he may judge his people. Father to me my faithful ones, who made a covenant with me by sacrifice, the heavens declare his righteousness, for God himself is judge, Selah. Here O my people, and I will speak, O Israel, I will testify against you. I am God, your God. Not for your sacrifices do I rebuke you. Your burnt offerings are continually before me. I will not accept a bull from your house, or goats from your folds, for every beast of the forest is mine, the cattle on a thousand hills. I know all the birds of the hills, and all that moves in the field is mine. If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world and its fullness are mine. Do I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and perform your vows to the Most High, and call upon me in the day of trouble. I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me. But to the wicked, God says, what right have you to recite my statutes, or take my covenant on your lips? For you hate discipline, and you cast my words behind you. If you see a thief, you are pleased with him, and you keep company with adulterers. You give your mouth free reign for evil, and your tongue frames deceit. You sit and speak against your brother. You slander your own mother's son. These things you have done, and I have been silent. You thought that I was one like yourself, but now I rebuke you and lay the charge before you. Mark this, then, you who forget God, lest I tear you apart, and there be none to deliver. The one who offers thanksgiving as his sacrifice glorifies me. To one who orders his way rightly, I will show the salvation of God. This is the word of the Lord. Good morning. I'll apologize up front if I sound, well, like, obviously the way I sound right now, so we'll try to make it. Happy Sunday after Thanksgiving. I trust the food was delicious and bountiful, and the naps were satisfying afterwards. Hope Uncle Bob didn't say anything crazy this year. Even if he did, you made it through. Congratulations. There is a lot to be thankful for, I trust you were able to realize. I do hope that there were moments of genuine thanksgiving in the midst of everything. In the midst of everything you had to prepare, everything you had to gather, every person you had to gather, everything that even went wrong, that you were able to enjoy all that God has, in fact, given you, and found yourself thankful. Thankful for the loving and life-giving relationships that remain in your life. For the provisions of work and shelter and transportation. For preservation through what is now 90% of another year. For the wonderful scenes of life that you've witnessed and enjoyed. For the gifts you've received, for the encouragements you've heard. For the changes that even refined and challenged you. Simply for how much more that you have than you deserve. For things not being as bad as they could be. These are the things that Thanksgiving can make us think about. Wonderful things. Things that we ought to think more regularly about. Things that we emerge from Thanksgiving thinking, oh, I should keep that in mind more regularly. It's enriching to be thankful. One author wrote it this way about Thanksgiving, delicious food is the daily sacrament of the unnecessary goodness in the world. Delicious food is the daily sacrament of the unnecessary goodness in the world. That's what wonderful food reminds us of, that there's this, all this stuff that doesn't have to be this good, but it is. And so we're thankful. So I was thinking about what to preach today, and of course, Thanksgiving was on my mind. And of course, there are plenty of texts that talk about giving thanks. But as I kept looking, I came across our passage today, Psalm 50, where giving thanks is couched in a rather unusual way, at least unusual to me. Thanksgiving is commanded as a rebuke. God comes to judge his people for giving their sacrifices and offerings without being thankful. So I thought that'd be a nice, cheerful way to wrap up the holiday. Psalm 50, turn there if you haven't yet. You'll see three kind of points, headings. First, the God who judges, verses 1 through 6. Then the God that we thank, verses 7 to 15. And then finally, the God who promises through the end of the chapter. The God who judges, the God we thank, and the God who promises. First, the God who judges, again, from Psalm 50, verse 1, a psalm of Asaph. The mighty one, God the Lord, speaks and summons the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting. Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines forth. Now God comes. He does not keep silence. Before him is a devouring fire, around him a mighty tempest. He calls to the heavens above and to the earth that he may judge his people. Gather to me my faithful ones who made a covenant with me by sacrifice. The heavens declare his righteousness, for God himself is judge. The title of the psalm says this is a psalm of Asaph, and there are several Asaphs in the Bible. This is most likely the Asaph appointed by King David as a musician for public worship for Israel. Which means unlike, very much unlike last week when we talked about Psalm 102, the exile is not happening. The exile is far from their purview. Jerusalem still very much belongs to the Israelites. The Lord is with them at the tabernacle, and the Ark of the Covenant is in their possession. So much so that verse 2, Zion is described this way, as the perfection of beauty. Remember Zion is just another word for Jerusalem. So outshining Zion, outshining, outperfecting the perfection of Zion's beauty is God. Zion's just the backdrop for God's more brilliant majesty. Zion's just the setting for the diamond who is God. He's introduced in verse 1 as the mighty one, God the Lord, El Elohim Yahweh. That's His name and His title together, a couple titles together, like kings might have been introduced in that day. But unlike kings, when He speaks, it's not just one city or one nation that answers Him. It's the whole earth that is summoned. Why is He summoning the earth? He's not summoning the earth for pleasure. He summons the earth because, verse 3, He can't keep silent anymore. He has a devouring fire in front of Him, a storm, a tempest surrounding Him. Devouring there literally means like it's an eating fire, a consuming fire. It's eating everything in its path. That's the entourage God has brought with Him. And He summons them to, verse 4, lay down judgment. He's saying, court is now in session. All rise before Me. Friends, God is a judge, eternally so. And I wonder how that makes you feel. It's not the most comfortable idea. It's also not the clearest idea to us. We don't face judges too often, I trust, if at all. What's important here, and in other things that the Scriptures tell us about things that we've not personally experienced, aspects about God that are still maybe dim to us, things that we are more familiar with in other places that we would draw upon experience to understand, what we need to do in these cases is not ultimately rely on our own experience to interpret what's happening, to understand what is being described. What's important is what God has said. And if He is declaring that He will judge His people, that means you and I have things about which you and I deserve judgment. That's what matters. That's the reality that needs to fill in our reality. That needs to correct our reality. If He's a judge, that means we stand in the face of a judge before Him. And lest we think that this is judgment reserved for others, you know, the people out there, the really bad ones, who is He actually gathered here to judge? Do you notice that? Verse 4, He's gathering, He's judging His own people. He's gathering who? Verse 5, my faithful ones who've made a covenant with me by sacrifice. To maybe use our language. He's judging Christians. How do you feel about that? Now, if you're a follower of Jesus, if you've placed your faith in Him, if you've trusted in Him to forgive your sins, you may see yourself as excused utterly from God's judgment. And importantly, I hope you do. God's Son was judged for your sins once and for all. There's therefore now no condemnation for you who are in Christ Jesus. Praise God. But friends, if you are emboldened by that fact, to think that you therefore have nothing to take account of in your life, if you take Jesus is enough for me to mean that I must be enough for Him, you're misunderstanding the gospel. And God's judgment of you will be true. Even more so because our issue today isn't so much legalism, legalistic religion, trying to earn our salvation up to God. That's less our issue now than it was in decades past. Our bigger issue is that we tend to overlay grace on everything so that we end up not having to change anything. Have you noticed that in your life? God will judge us for that. He is a judge. Next, we also see the God we thank. Verse 7, and just verse 7 for now, here, O my people, and I will speak, O Israel, I will testify against you. I am God, your God. Now whether you've been to court or not, you know that a lot of the result rests on one question. What is the judge like? Is he fair? Is she a little biased? Do they have something to prove? Right at the outset of his judgment against his people, it's easy to miss this, right as he has basically shown up as a threat to all existence. God reminds his people what he's like. He reminds them what kind of judge he is. What kind of judge is he? He's the God who made those unbreakable promises to Abraham about them. He's the one who spoke, who used these very words to Moses time and time again. How does he describe them in verse 7? You are my people, and he is your God. As he's announcing, pronouncing, about to declare judgment against them, how is he approaching them? He's approaching them as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The God of their forefathers, the one who knows them and loves them and chose them for no reason of their own. He's their God. They are his people. The judge before them, the one testifying against them, is the one who is committed to never forsake them. Friends, that is what makes all the difference. Knowing that the one who has come to judge you is more committed to you than anyone else is, knowing that his own glory is tied to your well-being. If you're standing there in front of the judge, that changes everything. You now know what this judge is like. And then you know his judgments, even if they be severe, are for your good, that they'll strengthen you, not break you. Parents, think about how you want your children to receive your discipline. Isn't that how you want them to understand your discipline of them? That you are disciplining them because you are the one most committed to their good, not despite. It's part of how a child matures in life, isn't it? They live more and more in the textures of parents who love them and therefore will correct them on occasion. How much more so with God our Father? If you think about it, this is basically the storyline, a major theme of the whole Bible. That as we stand condemned, judgeable in our sin, the one who judges us is also the one who loves us the most. The one who testifies against you, specifically you, in the same breath calls you, specifically you, his own. Christianity is experiencing both. Have you experienced both? Or maybe just one or the other? Just the one, just the judgment side? What does that leave you with? If God is just your judge, that leaves you in despair or that leaves you cynical? None of this matters anyway. I'm condemned anyway. On the other side, if God is just loving, what does that leave you? That leaves you unrepentant, proud. Christian, look at what the cross is. The cross is God announcing both. God judging your sin because he loves you, both together. What happens when we get that? What happens when we understand, have both of those lenses on? One of the things that happens, as far as this psalm is concerned, what happens is we can actually listen to him. We can even listen to him rebuke us and judge us. Otherwise you don't want to listen to him, right? Otherwise you're going to keep your distance. If the one judging you is the one who loves you most, you'll be inclined to listen. You will trust his judgments more than your own. Verse 8, 8 to 15. Not for your sacrifices do I rebuke you. Your burnt offerings are continually before me. I will not accept a bull from your house or goats from your folds. For every beast of the forest is mine, the cattle on a thousand hills. I know all the birds of the hills, and all that moves in the field is mine. If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world and its fullness are mine. Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats? Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving and perform your vows to the Most High and call upon me in the day of trouble. I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me. That's God saying. He's come to judge them. He's told them what kind of judge he is. He's not the kind they have seen in other places or other people they've come across. Now he's couching the rest of what he's saying by the fact, in the fact, that he owns everything. Verse 10, every beast of the forest is mine. Verse 11, all that moves in the field is mine. Verse 12, the world and its fullness are mine. God is saying, all those animals you guys are burning up and wafting in my direction, don't do all that because you think I need it. I don't need it. I make you offer sacrifices because you need it. You need to be tethered to me. Your hearts need ways to worship me. Your hearts need to know that life with me is better than life with just more stuff. Offering me those animals doesn't make me feel more secure or appeased. I already own all of them. All the cattle you'll ever sacrifice and all the other ones. All the birds you see in the sky, including the ones you never see, much less ever will offer me. Don't you see that you're worshiping me with my own stuff, let alone living off of it. It's not me who takes bulls from your fields. It's you who takes bulls from mine, which all makes the point. It's not me who ever needs to thank you. It's you who needs to thank me. God has us sacrifice his own stuff back to him. Not because he needs it, but because we think we do. We think it's all ours. We think we can't live without it. The more you think that, the more you'll serve and worship God so that God will owe you one. But when you realize that in fact you owe him everything, that all you could ever give him was his to begin with, you'll see that all that you have that's actually yours to give him is your thanks. Because everything you have is a gift from him. Have you experienced that? That switch? Going from worshiping and sacrificing and pleasing and giving to God, because he could sure use my help, to worshiping, sacrificing, pleasing, and giving to God out of gratitude that you get to enjoy any of this to begin with. Maybe the most analogous example we have, money. Take money. It's all God's money, guys. Even as you hear that, investigate what's happening in your heart. Yes, you worked for it. Yes, you were paid it. Like the Israelites did raise the cattle, did feed them. But it's all God's. The thousands of events behind you having your job at this time, the thousands of events behind your investments growing as they have, the unforeseen expenses in your life, the opportunities to be generous, how much of that was in your hands? How much of that did you bring about? It's all from God, because it's all his. So then, does that mean we don't need to give? No, we should give. Why? Not because God needs the money, but because your heart needs to give it. How much more greedy and concerned about worldly things would we be? How much more church would we miss? How much more foolishly would we spend? How much easier would it be to live for your own kingdom? We need to give because we need it. We need to learn that it's all his, that we get to enjoy it at all is a gift for which we should be thankful. That's one of those lessons you can't learn by just hearing it. You only learn it by practice. Brothers and sisters, it's a wonderful, it's a precious thing that God doesn't need anything from you. That is such a good thing. Because he'll never be smaller than you in any way. He'll never even be your peer. He'll never be in your debt. You'll never have leverage on him because you have nothing that he needs. Nothing you can do can help him. Nothing you withhold from him hurts him. It's a tremendously encouraging thing to think, to know that God doesn't need you at all. Just like the sun, we're like the earth. We're completely, utterly dependent on him every single second. We do nothing to keep him going. We should be thankful. And this means that when he commands us to worship and to thank him, it's not because he has some need to be praised, some praise bucket that needs to be filled by us. Maybe you've heard that, maybe you've thought that. The Psalms in particular, full of this seemingly praise-needy God, it's not because he's insecure. It's not because he's lonely. It's because praise and thanksgiving actually increase and even complete our enjoyment of everything. Haven't you felt this? C.S. Lewis famously realized this, a lengthier quote. The most obvious fact about praise, whether of God or anything, strangely escaped me. I thought of it in terms of compliment, approval, or the giving of honor. I'd never noticed that all enjoyment spontaneously overflows into praise. The world rings with praise, lovers praising their mistresses, readers their favorite poet, walkers praising the countryside, players praising their favorite game. We delight to praise what we enjoy because the praise not merely expresses but completes the enjoyment. It is its appointed consummation. The catechism says that man's chief end is to glorify God and enjoy him forever. But we shall then know that these are the same thing. To enjoy fully is to glorify. And in commanding us to glorify him, God is inviting us to enjoy him. This is the God who judges us, the God to whom we owe everything, and so the God we should thank. Thirdly, and lastly, the God who promises. Verse 16, but to the wicked, God says, what right have you to recite my statutes or take my covenant on your lips? For you hate discipline, and you cast my words behind you. If you see a thief, you're pleased with him, and you keep company with adulterers. You give your mouth free reign for evil, and your tongue frames deceit. You sit and speak against your brother. You slander your own mother's son. These things you have done, and I have been silent. You thought that I was one like yourself, but now I rebuke you and lay the charge before you. Mark this then, you who forget God, lest I tear you apart and there be none to deliver. The one who offers thanksgiving as his sacrifice glorifies me. To one who orders his way rightly, I will show the salvation of God. God makes two promises as this psalm closes. The first is to the wicked, and as he addresses the wicked in these verses 16 to 21, the you has been plural up until now, it's now singular. He zeroes in. He aims. It's not because there was only one person about whom this was true. He does this to emphasize that this is personal. No matter how big the crowd, no matter how large the nation, God is fully aware of every single person who lives this way. He's talking about you. This is a person who, at least by location, is part of the covenant community. In our day, this would be a church attender at the very least. Verse 16, this person recites God's statutes and covenant. They know what worship is. They know they're familiar with God and his ways and how they're supposed to live. They know this. They know the patterns. That's the best evidence they have. That's really all the evidence they can give. The rest of their life suggests they live by a very different code. How do they live? Just a glance at how he's described. He dismisses God's commands. He enjoys evil behavior, even joins in with evil behavior. He says evil things. He lies. He slanders even his own family. God calls this wickedness. If you weren't sure how any of those behaviors fell morally, God calls them wicked. And wickedness lives this way by being ignorant of God. To the point where, so ignorant is he of God that it's to the point where, verse 21, he thinks God is someone like him. You want to know what the premise of the wicked life is? You think God is like you. That's how you start living a wicked life. Of course, this is hardly an ancient problem, is it? J.I. Packer wrote this 50 years ago, could have been written yesterday. Today, vast stress is laid on the thought that God is personal. But this truth is stated so to give the impression that God is a person of the same sort as we are, weak, inadequate, ineffective, a little pathetic. This is not the God of the Bible. We are limited in every direction, in space, time, knowledge, and power. But God is not so. He is eternal, infinite, and almighty. He has us in his hands. We never have him in ours. Like us, he is personal. Unlike us, he is great. So it's an amazingly ignorant, arrogant thing to think, just from how the psalm has described God, that the one who can summon heaven and earth, the one who never hungers or thirsts, the one who owns literally everything is like you. What a thought. What a thing to believe and much more even live by. You who can summon nothing, you who owns nothing, you who needs food and drink every day just to stay alive, God's like you. It's when we're ignorant of that gap, that gap of majesty, that we start to get ignorant of the gap in righteousness and morality. You shrink God down to your size, and it turns out you start to see things eye to eye a little bit. It turns out God also tolerates what you tolerate. He too can bend to social pressures like you do. He too thinks that formal cultural religion might be enough. How does the wicked person get here? How do they start thinking this? That's not what he heard in the covenant community. That's not what he heard at church. Verse 17, he gets here this way, by hating God's discipline and casting God's words behind him. They're out of the way. The path is clear for me to live however I want, out of sight, out of mind, unbothered and untaught by God, uncorrected, uninstructed, left alone. You set God aside like this, and you become the center of gravity of your life, of the universe. Life revolves around you. Even God himself revolves around you. What does that mean? God is not the judge. You are. Brothers and sisters, do not cast aside God's word. Do not cast aside God's word. Never cast aside God's word. There's a way to hate God's discipline, cast aside his word. That looks obviously wicked, like he does here, running to things like theft and adultery in verse 18. Here's another side that I wonder might be more common, more likely among us. You can cast aside, you can hate God's discipline and his words because you'd think you don't really need them anymore. You're kind of above it now. I know, I know, I know. I've heard. I get it. I'm fine. I got it together. I'm not that bad. I'm actually pretty good. I've stayed faithful to my spouse. I'm part of a doctrinally serious church. I have all the right answers. Brothers and sisters, that is arrogance. That's its own version of the deceit of verse 19. You don't see the truth. A pastor once wrote, the worst people I've ever known have been doctrinally correct. The best people I've ever known have also been doctrinally correct. The difference is, the first use doctrine to reinforce their superiority, whereas the latter receive doctrine as a glimpse of Christ and bow low. Knowing doctrine, God, should not leave you thinking you are more like God. It should leave you thinking how unlike Him you are. Think about times when, in your life, you've been particularly engaged in Scripture. How did that feel? What was life like? How did you see the world? Conversely, think about times when you've been particularly unengaged with Scripture. What was life like? How were you seeing the world and your life? Maybe that's even now. The reality is, even in those times, you were still living according to something. You were still feeding on something. It was just something else. It was just something besides the truth. When that happens, whenever we feed and live by bad fuel, malnourishment, we get weak. Think about the way Scripture describes itself. Scripture calls itself, throughout the Bible, as the truth, as light, as treasure, as food. Whatever Scripture is saying, it's not exaggerating to give you some exaggerated, elevated sense of the reality. No, no. It's using lesser things than it to show you what it is like, because that's what we have. You need bread every day? Okay. That's what Scripture is like, the thing you need every day. You need light to see? That's what the Bible is like. That's what God's Word is like. You won't understand. You won't see anything else properly without it. When Jesus quotes Scripture to the devil, 40 days of not eating, and says, Men shall not live by bread alone, but every word that comes from the mouth of God. He's not exaggerating. He's describing exactly how our souls are designed. Exactly how our souls search for truth, and light, and treasure, and food from somewhere. Friends, do not cast aside God's Word. Otherwise, you will become like those God warns in verse 22. You will forget God. You will forget that He is the judge after all. You will forget that He is a judge who promises to tear the wicked apart. That's the first promise. The second promise is for the one who does not forget God, who has not cast his Word aside, who gives God thanks and lives rightly. Verse 23, once again. The one who offers thanksgiving as his sacrifice glorifies me. To one who orders his way rightly, I will show the salvation of God. Friends, if you cast aside God's Word, judgment is coming. But if you know that your judge is also your loving Father, whose words you can trust and you do trust, who has given you everything that you have, what does that mean? That means you can respond even to judgment with thanksgiving. And then you know, as he tells us, he promises you nothing less than your very salvation. Nothing less. He can promise a thousand other things, right? He promises salvation if this is the orientation of your heart. Verse 15, that when you call upon him, he will deliver you. It will be your joy to glorify him. Friends, if you're in Christ, isn't that what happened to you at some point? That you came to see the hopelessness of your sin. My goodness, I am before God the holy judge. I don't have a leg to stand on. I have nothing to hide behind. He has seen all of it. He knows it better than I do. What can I do? Where can I run? And then he turned your eyes to the cross, grace dripping in full. The salvation of God is not for those who give the most. It's not even for those who sin the least. It's for those who recognize that everything is a gift of God, including and foremost the gift of his own son. No more precious gift, no amount, no number of bulls or goats could ever match that value. Nothing you could ever do or sacrifice could make it even, could make it a trade. All you can do when you have nothing to give is to receive and give thanks. So friends, as we approach the Christmas season now, as we turn our eyes and our attention to this wondrous news, we should very much remain in the spirit of what we've just left. We should remain and even grow in our thanksgiving. Let's pray. Father, it is because you are our Father that we can even dare to approach you. That you, the holy judge of the heavens and the earth, beckon us to approach your throne because your throne is a throne of grace. God, would you sober us about ourselves that we might see ourselves more rightly, that we would no longer and less so think that you are like us and we like you. And as you do so, Lord, help us to see, help us to have clearer, more in full color vision that everything we have and even everything that we could ever give belongs to you. And that our role, if we see that rightly, is to simply be in awe and thankfulness. Teach us these things in our hearts, Lord, particularly now as we enter this last month of the year and consider the extraordinary gift of your son, who wasn't just here to be born and to live as an example, but to give his own life for sinners. Thank you. Broaden our minds and our understanding of this. In Christ's name we pray, amen.
