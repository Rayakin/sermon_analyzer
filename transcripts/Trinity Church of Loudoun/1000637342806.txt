In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land, and a man of Bethlehem and Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab. He and his wife and his two sons, the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of the wife was Naomi, and the names of the two sons were Malon and Chilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem and Judah. They went into the country of Moab and remained there, but Elimelech, the husband of Naomi, died, and she was left with her two sons. These took Moabite wives. The name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other was Ruth. They lived there about ten years, and both Malon and Chilion died, so that the woman was left without her two sons and her husband. Then she arose with her two daughters-in-law to return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the fields of Moab that the Lord had visited his people and given them food. So she set out from the place where she was with her two daughters-in-law, and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah. But Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each of you to your mother's house. May the Lord deal kindly with you as you have dealt with the dead and with me. The Lord grant that you may find rest, each of you, in the house of your husband. Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept. And they said to her, No, we will not return with you to your people. But Naomi said, Turn back, my daughters. Why will you go with me? Have I yet sons in my womb that may be become your husbands? Turn back, my daughters. Go your way, for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say I have hope, even if I should have a husband this night, and should bear sons, would you therefore wait till they were grown? Would you therefore refrain from marrying? No, my daughters, for it is exceedingly bitter to me for your sake that the hand of the Lord has gone out against me. Then they lifted up their voices and wept again. And Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her. And she said, See, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods. Return after your sister-in-law. But Ruth said, Do not urge me to leave you or to return from following you. For where you go, I will go, and where you lodge, I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, and your God my God. Where you die, I will die, and there will I be buried. May the Lord do so to me, and more also if anything but death parts me from you. And when Naomi saw that she was determined to go with her, she said no more. So the two of them went out until they came to Bethlehem. And when they came to Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them. And the woman said, Is this Naomi? She said to them, Do not call me Naomi. Call me Mara. For the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me. I went away full, and the Lord has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi when the Lord has testified against me, and the Almighty has brought calamity upon me? So Naomi returned, and Ruth and the Moabite her daughter-in-law with her, who returned from the country of Moab, and they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest. This is the word of the Lord. In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land. And a man of Bethlehem and Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab. He and his wife and his two sons. The name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of the wife was Naomi. And the names of the two sons were Malon and Chilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem and Judah. And he went into the country of Moab and remained there. But Elimelech, the... As a kid, I grew up way back in the woods. Way back in the woods, like down a long dirt path, far behind any other houses. And then behind my house, there were just woods, and more woods, and a lot of acres. It was a perfect setting for a kid, even an indoorsy kid, such as myself. My brothers and I built forts. We found special hidden paradises in the woods. We discovered Snake City. There was a snake one time. Snake City. We discovered Trash City, way back in the woods. Actually really hard to find. Actually deep in the woods, there was a pit with leaves and trees and everything, but a pit filled with random, very, very old, long-ago discarded items, treasures maybe. One winter afternoon, we made our way, my brothers and I, we made our way back to Trash City, and we found it. And it was snowing outside, and so we went treasure hunting in the snow. After a couple of hours searching, we made our way back home. But the woods were now a white, wintry blanket paradise. It was beautiful, also disorienting. We couldn't find the usual markers and sort of signposts for, you're headed the right way, boys. So we got turned around, and we walked in a few circles, ended up back at Trash City, and you know how that is. You eventually lose all sense of direction. It's a horrible feeling. At one point, I remember starting to cry. I wasn't sure we'd make it out. I could see my headline in the morning paper the next afternoon, 12-year-old dies, freezes to death in his own backyard, subtitle, he knew he should have stayed inside. But we kept walking, and my mom had a gigantic cast-iron bell, which she'd ring when we were in the woods to tell us, usually to tell us it was time for dinner and time to come home. So we kept moving, and eventually things started to look familiar again, and then more familiar, and then through the snow-claddened trees, at long last, you could see the silhouette of our house through our backyard, and I think I cried again. I know I ran. We made it back home. This morning, we're going to start a new series in Ruth. So if you have a Bible, turn to the, it's the eighth book in your Bible, but it's after some big books. It comes right after Judges, and it's a really short book itself, so you might skip right past it, but it's at the beginning of your Bible, right after Judges. And for this Advent series and Advent season, I'm really excited to dive into and to walk all the way through, beginning to end, the book of Ruth. Ruth is a remarkable little book containing a remarkable story. Ruth is one of two books in the Bible named after a woman. The other book is Esther. Ruth is the only book in the Bible named after a Gentile, only book in the entire Bible named after a not-Israelite, a not, an outsider to the people of God. It's written some 1,000 to 1,200 years before Christ, during the time of the Judges, during a time when Israel is now in the promised land. Remember the promised land with Abraham and the journeys and Joshua and finally settling and conquering. Well, they're now in the promised land, but there's still no kingdom. We don't know who the author of Ruth is. There are many suggestions, Nathan or Samuel or some other prophet. There are suggestions that Tamar from Genesis 38, Judah and Tamar wrote Ruth. I don't know on what basis, but the bottom line is nobody knows who wrote the book of Ruth. In our English Bibles, Ruth is situated between, right after Judges and right before 1 and 2 Samuel, which is really helpful historically, because in the book of Judges, there's no king. When we get to the books of 1 and 2 Samuel, there is a king and a kingdom, Saul and David and all the rest. Ruth stands between those two books and shows us how we got from no king to a king. So that's really helpful historically, but in the Hebrew Bible, Ruth is placed more at the end and after the book of Proverbs, which is also very helpful and provocative in a totally different way. See, Proverbs ends, Proverbs chapter 31 is a very famous chapter in the Bible about the virtuous woman, the noble woman. Proverbs 31 begins, an excellent wife who can find, she is far more precious than jewels. Proverbs 31 ends, many women have done excellently, but you surpassed them all. Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised. And with that ending, in this ordering, we turn the page to the book of Ruth. Do you see? The first chapter, which we'll cover this morning, of the book of Ruth is arranged geographically. There are three different scenes which take place in these 22 verses in three different places. The first scene is away in Moab. The second scene is the journey back home from Moab, back home to Israel. And the final scene is arrival back home in Bethlehem. So if you're a note taker and you want to follow the sort of sequence of this sermon and this chapter, that's a really helpful marker and those will be my three points for this morning. First, let's look together at a family of refugees in Moab in verses one through five. Verse one begins, in the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land and a man of Bethlehem in Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons. This opening verse situates this story in a specific time, namely in the days when the judges ruled. That's the author of Ruth's way of not just dating this book, but telling you what was going on during this time. This is the time when Israel has occupied the promised land. They made it to their new home. Remember, people, place, blessing. They've made it to the place. They're there. But this is also the time when things got dark and then really dark in Israel's history. The book of Judges right before Ruth tells that dark, dark tale. Judges, you don't have to turn there, but Judges 2, 11 and 12 says this, and the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. And they served the Baals. They served idols, other gods, not gods. And they abandoned the Lord, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt. Apostasy. They went after other gods from among the gods of the peoples who were around them, and they bowed down to them, and they provoked the Lord to anger. Those are the days of Judges. Judges 19 is one of the darkest chapters in the entire Bible. It involves a man, I'm not going to go into all the details, but a man, his concubine, her cheating on him, him forgiving her, taking her back. Then they go on a journey together. Then they're accosted, and she's assaulted repeatedly and in every possible way by a horde of drunken men, children of Abraham. And then the man, finding her barely alive in the morning at the doorway, divides her limb by limb. I should have said earmuffs children before I got here. I'm sorry, it's too late now. And he sends her parts throughout all of Israel. These were Israel's darkest days, a period of time when Israel's movie would have fit really only into the horror genre. In the note, the author of Judges keeps repeating to explain the situation again and again and again was this, quote, in those days there was no king in Israel, and so everybody did what was right in their own eyes. That's the final verse in the book of Judges, but it's a repeated phrase throughout the book. There was no king, and so everybody became a king, and moral chaos ensued. That's the setting of the book of Ruth. And that's really important that you and I know that, see that before we dive in. This book is set in those horribly dark and dangerous days of the Judges. In those days, there was a famine in the land. So Ruth takes this big, awful, dark, horror story, and it zooms into one little family just trying to make their way during a famine. There's an irony here actually in these first few verses, which we're likely to miss, but which no Jewish reader would have missed. The land here, there's a famine in the land. The land here is the promised land. What do we know about the promised land from all that was promised and then Israel's eventual conquest of the promised land? It goes by another nickname throughout the Bible, probably its most popular nickname besides the promised land. You know what the nickname was? The land flowing with milk and honey. This wasn't an arid, desert, dry, desolate land. This was the land flowing with milk and honey. I went to Israel in 2014, and I don't know why, bad Sunday school ideas or just general ignorance, but I expected to walk out to thronged sandals, and that's not a word, sandals and deserts, and I stepped out and we walked into what I imagined as Greece, a green Mediterranean paradise. This is the land flowing with milk and honey, and this family is from Bethlehem. There's another irony here. Do you know what Bethlehem means? It means house of bread, a house, a town, a place so yielding of produce. The pantry's always full. It's literally the house of bread, and that's where Elimelech and Naomi, this husband and wife, are from, the place where you're never going to hunger. So the story, think about it, begins by introducing us to a man from the house of bread in the land of milk and honey, fleeing that land because of a famine. What? What's going on here? False advertisement, like Greenland, Iceland, you remember that story? God had warned Israel repeatedly that if she abandoned him and served other gods, he would turn away from blessing her, repeatedly. For example, Deuteronomy 11, before the scene of Ruth, Deuteronomy 11, verse 16, take care, Israel, lest your heart be deceived and you turn aside and serve other gods and worship them. If you do that, then the anger of the Lord will be kindled against you and he will shut up the heavens so that there will be no rain and the land will yield no fruit and you will perish quickly off the good land that the Lord is giving you. Do you hear that warning? God has apparently shut up the heavens here, called off the rains. Apparently Israel, in these days of the judges, Naomi and Elimelech, apparently Israel has fallen in those awful dark days under God's curse. This is really important, not just because it gives us a clue to how we got here. This is really important because it gives us a clue for where to go. We've seen famines before. If you're new here this morning, we've been in Genesis for a long time. Famines are a pretty common occurrence in the book of Genesis. Abraham encountered multiple famines. Then Isaac, after him, encountered another famine. We've seen the disaster which comes when the people of God don't trust God, don't wait upon God, but take matters into their own hands and flee for Egypt or wherever. It never goes well. We know that story. Elimelech, Naomi, and all Israel should not have left the land here. They should have seen God's judgment and repented and cried out to God in repentance and begged for mercy and invited everybody in Bethlehem and everybody in all of Israel to join them in repenting and seeking the Lord. Instead, they go to Moab, a short 30-mile journey. Just a few days, no more than a week by foot, but Moab. The nation descended from Lot, do you remember? Lot's incestuous relationship with his daughter, Genesis 19. The nation whose king had bought a prophet magician, remember Balaam, to pronounce curses upon Israel. He paid a magic guy to pronounce curses upon Israel and it backfired, Numbers 22. The nation who worshiped other gods who sacrificed children to appease those gods, 2 Kings 3. Deuteronomy 23, listen, this is God's word to his people. No Moabite may enter the assembly of the Lord. Even to the 10th generation, none of them may enter the assembly of the Lord forever. Just imagine a, I don't know, a sign on the front of our doors, Moabites, none allowed. You shall, God says, you shall not seek their peace or their prosperity all your days. No prayers for Moab, Moab. Elimelech means my God is king. The names here in Ruth are really important. Elimelech means my God is king. Naomi means sweet or, or, or sweetie. There's nothing sweet about this move and Elimelech is acting like anything, but he believes that his God is king. The story of Ruth begins with a refugee family in a foreign godless land searching for food. It must've been welcomed in this foreign land or at least tolerated. They turned their back on God and on his promises, but they seem to be received and it seems to have paid off until all their luck eventually dried up. Look at verse three, but Elimelech, the husband of Naomi, died and she was left with her two sons. These sons took Moabite wives. The name of the one was Orpah, the name of the other was Ruth. They lived there about 10 years and both Malon and Kilian died so that the woman was left, Naomi was left without her two sons and without her husband. Notice from verses two to four, 10 years passed just like that. Verse one seems to suggest that they only intended to stay in Moab for a short while. If you have a NIV translation, it says they headed to Moab for, for a little while. But in a verse, a decade has passed. That's how we, that's how we tend to work and that's how sin tends to work, isn't it? Just a little while, just a little bit, just like that. 10 years later, just like that, you're in over your head and you're drowning. We, oh, how easily we persuade ourselves, deceive ourselves and walk right into disaster. That's exactly what Naomi and Elimelech have done here. The boys have now taken Moabite wives, forbidden by God, but also totally predictable, inevitable down in Moab, boys of that age. And then the real trouble comes first, Elimelech dies, and so Naomi is a widow and then the boys die. Melon means sickly, Kilion means wasting away. And whether they were named that by their parents or much later by the, by the narrator of this story to give colorful effect, it doesn't matter. Either way, their names came true as they both die. Naomi is now husbandless and childless. She's lost everything in a foreign land. And the author captures this artistically. Look at verse five, as Naomi now becomes the woman. That's all she is, a nameless woman who has lost everything. Surely Naomi agrees with this perspective. The word she chooses to capture her new status by the end of the chapter, verse 21, is empty. I wonder how many of you this morning in one way or in a thousand ways feel empty. What you once had or maybe what you surely thought you'd have by now, do you have it? The marriage you thought you'd have, the family you thought you'd have, the relationship with your children you thought you'd have, the friendships you thought you'd have, the friendships in this church you thought you'd have by now, the job you thought you'd have, the money, the security you thought you'd have, the recognition you thought you'd have, the position, the status you thought you'd earn, you thought you deserve, the joy, the happiness you thought you'd have. Is that what you have? If that's what you have, I'd love to meet you and shake your hand. Life tends to leave you empty, doesn't it? If not now, then probably later. We all lose so much by the end. And we deserve it. Sure, yeah, I turn my back on God just like this family. I've headed for my Moabs in one way or a hundred, but that doesn't really help when we feel empty, does it? It just adds shame to the sting. Oh, for a merciful God who will see us, get us, and still forgive us and just help us. Naomi is surely the most relatable character in this story for most of us. She's empty. However she got there, she's empty. And so she goes for the one thing that's still there when all else fails, home. She heads home. So the second scene, I want you to look with me now in verses six through 18, is the journey back home. The second scene begins with a rumor in verse six, which has made its way down to Moab and eventually somehow to Naomi. The famine has ended. God has visited his people, verse six says. God has opened up the heavens again. The curse is lifted. The language of verse six is really provocative. And it seems to invite us into Naomi's mind and into her heart. She heard that the Lord had visited his people, notice, and given them food. Think about that. Naomi was God's people. It's not them and his people over there. She was God's people. She's a daughter of Israel. She's one of them. But now there's a, do you see, there's a distance between her and them. She's separated. She's other. And she feels it. Like a woman who discovers that her ex, who did her so dirty, is now so happy and happily ever after. Great. Betrayed, she must feel. The most important word in this entire section, maybe the entire chapter, is the word return. Just look through chapter one and notice how many times the word return or go back or something like that. The Bible translates the same word in several different ways here, but it's all the same word. It's in verse six. She arose to return from Moab. It's in verse seven. They went on their way to return to the land of Judah. It's in verse eight. And it's just repeated again and again and again throughout the chapter. Twelve times one word is in here. It's the word return. Do you think the author wants you to pay attention to that word return? In verse six, after more than a decade away in Moab, Naomi gets up, she arose, we read, and she makes her return home. And her daughter's-in-law start walking with her. You sort of get the impression as you read this, there's a lot between the lines, we don't know, but you sort of get the impression that, yeah, there are tears, maybe some initial goodbyes and hugs. But Naomi puts her head down, bitter, sulking, empty, and she starts the journey home, and then she sort of realizes, they're still with me. Like you go off into the woods, and there's a stray dog, and some animal, and you play with it a little bit, and you start to walk away, or your neighbor's yard, and it's just following you. What are you doing here? Or maybe this was an unspoken plan. Naomi had them come with her, but as she got closer to home, she reconsidered as she was facing her desperate prospects. We don't know, but she stops and says, look at verse eight, go, return each of you, there's that word again, return each of you to her mother's house. May the Lord deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me. And may the Lord grant that you may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. And then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept. Naomi here pronounces a blessing over her daughter's-in-law when she says, may the Lord deal kindly with you. The Lord here is Yahweh. It's Israel's God, the covenant God, the God of Naomi, the God who is. May the Lord, Naomi says, deal kindly with you, that word deal kindly, those words are one word in the original, and it's the big, big, big, big, big word hesed or kesed. It's the highest form of covenant loyalty and love, which can be expressed by one to another. It's an utter commitment that is not earned, is not deserved, but will not be broken. It's the love, the loyalty, the covenantal commitment, which Yahweh, the God of Israel, makes to his people. Here Naomi pronounces a blessing over the daughters. May the Lord, may Yahweh, deal kindly, hesed, with you. Naomi cares for them, and even in her pain, she loves them here. You can see that they've grown to love her too. They lift up their voices and weep. They're still with her. Verse 10, they insist on returning with her. This clearly shows us Naomi's character as a mother-in-law. They love this woman. They've grown attached to her, and yet Naomi will not budge. Now I want you to look carefully at her words beginning in verse 11. Verse 11, but Naomi said, turn back, guess what? Same word, return. Turn back, my daughters. Why will you go with me? Have I yet sons in my womb that they may become your husbands? Turn back, same word, return. My daughters, go your way, for I'm too old to have a husband. If I should say, I have hope, even if I should have a husband this night and should bear sons, would you therefore wait till they were grown? Would you therefore refrain from marrying for all those years? No, my daughters. This is exceedingly bitter to me for your sake that the hand of the Lord has gone out against me. Then they lifted up their voices again and wept again. We are again and again, this first chapter, invited into Naomi's pain in this story. By her words, by the narrator's words, she's empty. She's bitter. Her time has expired. She feels that she's under God's curse. Maybe Israel was, Bethlehem was, but that curse has been lifted, but for Naomi in her own mind, in her own soul, she feels she's under God's curse. The hand of the Lord has gone out against me. Listen, she's reading her life, her story, the death all around her as God's judgment upon her. She's a cursed woman. She loves these girls. They're family now. That's exactly why she sends them back, to leave her, to get away from her so they're not cursed too. Naomi is a woman who has lost hope. And I wonder, not if, but where, you've lost hope this morning. What's gone so wrong in your life, maybe for so long, that you've just made peace with God not doing anything about it. Whether it's an issue of his ability or his willingness, you've accepted it, you've lost hope. That's what it is to be empty here. That's where Naomi is. What happens next in verse 14, I'm sure that Naomi didn't expect. If we had not, many of us read this story or heard it a hundred times, we surely would not expect it. And Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her. Orpah finally relents. She listens to Naomi and to her reasons, it's very sound logic, but Ruth will not let go. The narrator pictures her as literally physically clinging and hanging on to Ruth. She won't let go of her. Verse 15, Naomi pleads, see, look, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods. Go with her. Return again, return with her. You guys remember White Fang? Some of you are too young. Remember the end of White Fang? Are you serious? Disney classic, 1991, something like that. Holiday assignment, college students, this is a coming of age moment. You need to go watch White Fang. I'm sure it's on Disney. It's a story of a boy, a young man, and his wolf who becomes his best friend. And at the end of the story, he realized, massive spoiler, very important. At the end of the story, he realizes that he needs to, for the dog's good and for the safety of those around him, he needs to part way with this wolf, his best friend. And so he gives him a big hug and talks to him, his best friend, and then he sends him away. And the dog's confused, but he doesn't listen. And so he, the boy starts, the man, young man starts yelling at him, away, go. And the dog's now, looks like the dog's crying. The boy's crying, away, go. And the dog still won't listen. And so he picks up sticks and he starts, he starts throwing at, get away from me, get away. In love, he said, that's Naomi here with Ruth, get away from me, go. In love she does it, but she's trying to get rid of this woman who will not let go of her legs or whatever. And then Ruth utters the immortal words, which will alter history and salvation history. Verse 16, and Ruth said, do not urge me to leave you or to return from following you. For where you go, I will go. And where you lodge, I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, your God, my God. Notice we just recognized members, they've made a comment. Part of serving God is serving his people. Notice Ruth here connects the dot. You get this God, you get his people too. Your people, my people, your God, my God. Where you die, I will die. And there will I be buried. May the Lord do so to me and more also, if anything but death parts me from you. I want to press pause here in this moment, this momentous moment. And on these two young women, Ruth and Orpah, Ruth and Orpah are probably, if they married the boys, according to the average age and customs of the day, they're probably by this point somewhere in their mid to at most late twenties. They're still young women with all kinds of life before them. They can marry and still have children and quiver fulls of children and full lives of prosperity. Ruth and Orpah are young women. They're also Moabites, you can't miss that. They worshiped other gods. They probably grew up, both of them, offering sacrifices to other gods who were not gods. If they go home with Naomi, well, Naomi knows what awaits. Naomi has no other sons, no other prospects for sons. She has no family waiting for her to take her in. She has no way of providing for the girls. She's from a small town and she has nothing. This is a man's world. She lives in Israel, 1,200 BC. This is a man's world and a widow like Naomi awaits a brutal destiny, a life with Naomi for Ruth and Orpah is a life of emptiness. And so Orpah returns home. Ruth returns with Naomi to Bethlehem. Why? Ruth loves Naomi. Orpah loves Naomi. Ruth is kind here to Naomi. Orpah is kind to Naomi. There's no shunning here, spurning here. What's the difference between Ruth and Orpah? Orpah trades a life with Naomi in the promised land for a life, for comfort, for security, for marriage, for prosperity. Orpah, in other words, falls into a long line, a family tree, if you will, of those who will come near to Jesus, who are good to Jesus, who like Jesus, but who will not ultimately worship Jesus. The rich young ruler, King Agrippa, Paul, would you have me to believe? Simon Magus, Orpah, Orpah made the sensible choice here, the choice our parents all raised us to make. And in eternity, it cost her everything. Maybe that's some of you right now, making the same choice, fine with Jesus, no hostility. You probably wouldn't be here if you hated the guy, good with Jesus, interested even in Jesus, but you've never surrendered your life to Jesus as your king. If only you could see from God's word that you're trading eternity and eternal joy for comfort here, for what you're used to, for familiarity. You can't be cool with Jesus. He's a king. You worship him or you despise him is how Jesus spoke. Orpah makes the obvious choice here. Ruth, on the other hand, trades all of that and everything she knows, her life, her security, her prospects, everything she knows for Naomi and for Naomi's home and for Naomi's God. Your people, my people, your God, my God, R.C. Sproul's wife, Vesta, had this engraved on their wedding bands, your people, my people, your gods, my God, where you go, I will go. It's a pledge of allegiance Ruth makes here to Naomi, also to her God. Ruth takes everything she has, her gods, her people, her home, her prospects for marriage and children and financial security in life. She takes everything she has and she slides them to the center of the table all in. For Ruth, this is an act of loyalty. This is hesed. It's also a confession of faith. This is a conversion. Your God, my God. Watch this. The word I told you about earlier, the most important word probably in this chapter, repeated 12 times throughout the chapter, return, the word is shew. It can also be translated and is often translated throughout the rest of the Old Testament as repent. That's what repentance means. It means to turn around. It means you're walking one way and you turn around, you about face, it's a military term, you 180 and walk the other direction. It means to change, to change your allegiance, to change your direction. It means, in other words, to return. Look at verse 22 at the end of the chapter. I want to show you something peculiar here. Verse 22 says, Naomi returned and Ruth the Moabite with her, who returned from the country of Moab. Think about those words and how strange they are. Ruth returned to Bethlehem. Ruth don't skim over those words. Ruth's never been to Bethlehem. How can she return? The author is doing something here and throughout this entire chapter, it's a chapter about returning. It's a journey back home. That's the story here, but it's more than that. Verse 22 and it's weirdness just makes that obvious. It's a chapter, not just about returning. It's a chapter about repentance. Ruth one is the story of Naomi repenting. She's got a long ways to go. She's a hurt, bitter woman, but she leaves Moab and she returns to the promised land where she belonged in the first place. That's repentance. Ruth chapter one is a story of Ruth repenting for the first time. She turns from her gods and from her former life and she comes home to for the first time to the God who made her. Nice to meet you. That's repentance. The path home for Naomi and Ruth, for Naomi finally, for Ruth for the first time. The path home was a path of repentance. It's the only way home. Friends, do you remember the promises of Abraham and Genesis? Of course you do. People place blessing. Do you remember that original promise all the way back in Genesis 12? In you, God told Abraham, Genesis 12, three, in you, all the families of the earth shall be blessed. Another way you can translate that is, and it's the same meaning, in you, God's telling Abraham in you, all the nations of the earth shall be blessed. What is happening here in Ruth one? There is a Gentile woman, a despised Moabite no less, entering into the people of God and the place of God, finding her way into Abraham's blessing. The promises of Abraham are still coming true in Ruth chapter one and listen, the promises of Abraham are still coming true and they're true here and now and everywhere. Has anyone repents, that just means to turn, the same thing, and believes in Jesus? Have you turned from your sins and trusted in Jesus? Every time one does, God's promise to Abraham in Genesis chapter 12 comes true again and again and again and again. How were Old Testament believers saved? It's a question I get asked somewhat regularly. How were Old Testament believers saved? I get now after Jesus, but what about Old Testament believers? I get asked that somewhat regularly. I would offer two answers, not two different ways, two different aspects of one answer. First of all, they allied themselves to the God of Israel and if you were a Gentile, a pagan like Ruth, that meant repenting, turning away from your former gods, walking away from them. They allied themselves to the God of Israel. They covenanted together with him. Number two, they trusted in his promises. They believed. People usually ask that question, how were Old Testament believers saved? The answer is actually in the question. You just don't realize it. They believed. Just like you and I, in a way, in a big picture, they entered into God's salvation, God's blessing, the same way that we do, by belief. The only difference is the difference of time. They were waiting, looking forward to a seed, Genesis 3.15, to a king, 2 Samuel 7. They didn't know his name. They were looking forward to some future glorious work of God. They didn't know exactly what it would look like, but they were believing in it. They were hoping in it, banking their lives upon it. It's the same for us. The only difference is we're looking back. We know that work of God. We know that work of God has a name. His name is Jesus. Ruth has taken every chip she has and wagered it all on Naomi and Naomi's God, all in. And when Naomi saw, verse 18 says, that she was determined to go with her, she said no more. That brings us to the final scene, a brief scene, verses 19 through 22. It takes place back home now in Bethlehem, back home in Bethlehem. And I just want to show you briefly, there are at least three cords of hope in this final scene, in these final few verses. Three little cords or strands of hope. The first is their return and the stir it causes in the town of Bethlehem. Look at verse 19. So the two of them, Orpah's now gone, Ruth and Naomi went on until they came to Bethlehem. And when they came to Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them. Look at that. The whole town is abuzz with the strange travelers. This is a really small town. Remember Mary, Jesus, very, very, very small town. And so every, but it's lit up with excitement. Naomi, is that you? Ten years later, ten years of suffering, ten years of loss, ten years of wrinkles, ten years of gray hairs, Naomi, is that you? And is that a Moabite? What's she doing here? One single conversion can set ablaze an entire community. I taught a class this morning on the first great awakening. It all began 1734 in New England, the congregation of Jonathan Edwards. One person was converted and it shook the congregation. And then a few more, and then a few dozen more. And a few years later, a few thousand more. It all began with one. One conversion can shake a church out of its deadness, its dryness, its having lost hope that God really does still save people who are far from God. One little conversion. The whole town is abuzz. The second cord of hope is buried in Naomi's anguish. Look at the end of verse 19 and the verses to follow. And the woman said, the women said, the women of the town of Bethlehem, is this Naomi? And she said to them, do not call me Naomi. Call me Mara. Remember, remember Naomi means sweet or sweetie. Mara means bitter. Do not call me Naomi. Call me Mara for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me. I went away fool, she says, and the Lord has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi when the Lord has testified against me and the Almighty has brought calamity upon me? Really hopeful, right? Not really, but look carefully. Naomi is home here. She's not Naomi anymore. She's gone from sweet Naomi to bitter Mara. She's gone from fool to empty and she sees it all as the Lord's hand, as the Lord's judgment upon her. Verses 20 to 21 are something like a public lament. Sometimes we pray prayers of lament on occasion in our service. This is like a public lament. It's not pretty. Naomi is raw and drenched in her own tears here. She's angry and bitter. I think Naomi is honestly the most ambiguous character in the story so far. It's tempting to put a black and white hat on her. She's all good and everything she does is good here. A really black hat. I've read plenty of authors trying to do just that, but no hat really fits on Naomi, at least not for long. She's angry. She's bitter. She's angry at the Lord, but she still believes in the Lord. She's crying out, not just about him. She's crying out at him. She calls him El Shaddai here, the Almighty. She sees her life as lived under his promises, which include for her, his providences rather, which include for her, curses. Naomi is the most ambiguous character in this story so far through chapter one, but she also might be the most relatable. You ever lost everything? Everything you cared about? And you know you did wrong again, but again, God is in charge. He could have stopped it. What would you feel if that's your story? What would you say out loud? What would you say about God? Would you stop believing? Would you just hide Romans 8, 28, he's working all things together for my good in your heart and just repeat it over. It's all for my good. Really? Are you sure? Just smile? Or would you kick and scream and cry and blame, but still believe? Maybe like Naomi, Naomi is an open bleeding heart here. She's also dead wrong in what she says. She tells the whole town that she's come back empty and it's quite obviously false. Anybody with eyes can see it. The whole town can see it. She has no husband. Yes, she has no sons. True. She has no possessions. She has no full pocket. She has no real plan for life. You see her point, but what does she have? What does she have? Talk to me. She has Ruth, the Moabite, her loyal daughter-in-law who has pledged her life to her and to her God. Naomi is not empty. She just can't see it. She has Ruth and she still has all the precious promises of God. We're all like that, aren't we? God gives, God takes away, and we almost never know why. We almost never know what he's doing. Even much later in life, we seldom know exactly all that God is doing. And we so often miss what he's given as we stare at what he's taken away. We're so stuck on that. Naomi's just like that, just like us really. But Ruth, the book of Ruth is written so that we can see what Naomi cannot see. She can't see it, but you can see it. God took away everything Naomi had. She is, in some ways, like a little miniature Job, but he gave to Naomi Ruth, who Naomi didn't really want her to come with her, go, get away from me. And yet here she is. And Ruth, Naomi has no idea, Ruth is going to bring blessing to the whole world, including Naomi. She has no idea, and neither do you, what all God is doing, and neither do I. He gives, he takes away. We don't always know that he's often, or realize that he's often taking away one thing to give something else. We don't know what that is, or when that will come, or what that will look like, what that will produce. All we know is that he's good, and his plans are better than we can imagine, which is enough to trust him. The chapter ends with a final chord of hope, and a new beginning, really. Look at verse 22, as we close. So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabite, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned from the country of Moab, and they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest. Barley harvest, amen? God is doing a new work. The famine is over. That's what that verse means. The curse is lifted. There's grain again. Bread has returned to the house of bread, and though the little town cannot see it, and perhaps Naomi cannot yet either, God is doing a new and greater work even than that. A new work in Naomi, and surprise, a new work through the Gentile Moabite widow. She's brought back with her to Bethlehem. Through her, surprise, the royal line is gonna spring forth, and a savior's gonna come. They say if you ever move back to wherever you came from, you never return to the same place. Sometimes I wonder what it would be like if I ever moved back to the town, the small town I grew up in where so many of my formative memories are just sort of locked up there forever. It's a charming thought, and probably more so as I get older, but I also know that it would never be the same. The town's not the same. My parents live in the same house I grew up in, but even the surrounding area, it's just not, the terrain's not the same. Trash city's gone. I'm also not the same. Neither are you. I know some of you, others of you would never, ever, ever want to go back to where you're from. Too much pain, or there's nothing left there. It's not home for you anymore. My favorite image, I think, for heaven in the Bible is home. The place where we were made for. With a God who made us to be with him. The God who is himself our home. The path there, our true and everlasting home, is too a path of repentance. You must turn from your sins. You must bow to Jesus as king. That's the path to forgiveness. It's also the way back home. God, we pray that.
