Amazing Grace. It is our most well-known hymn, perhaps our most well-known hymn from all of church history. It's the John 3.16 of our hymnody, if you will. When I was in late college, at the end of college, I worked at an arena in Raleigh where they'd put on various events and galas for important people and important events. And at one of those events, I don't remember what the event was. I do remember that Charles Barkley was there and that I did everything in my power to make sure that I was the one that picked up his dirty and finished plate. But I don't remember what the event was for, but I remember that they had a woman scheduled to sing Amazing Grace, which was remarkable to me because there was nothing that I could figure out, particularly religious, about this event or about the people at this event, certainly not Christian. It wasn't a Christian event by any stretch of the imagination. And so I sort of hovered in the back of the arena as she took the stage to perform before all these guests, important people, Amazing Grace. And I watched and I listened as she sung all the lyrics, which the song doesn't actually talk about the cross or the resurrection, so she was safe in that sense. But she sung about heaven when we've been there 10,000 years bright shining as the sun. She sung about God. We've no less days to sing God's praise than when we first begun. She sang it all, the entire hymn, except for one line that she changed. Actually, one word that she changed. She sang at the beginning and at the end of the song, Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound that saved a soul like me. And then she repeated it at the end. Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound that saved a soul like me. Well, I'm sure most people in the room had no idea what she'd just done, but I was raised in the church, baby, so it stuck out to me like a sore thumb. The original line, the only version I've ever known or sung goes like this, Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me. Wretch, a word we don't use very much anymore, akin to wretched, which we seldom use, definition, a miserable, despicable, vile person synonyms, scoundrel, liar, lowlife, miscreant, dog, pariah, worm, wretch. The song was written in 1772 by Isaac Newton. Newton's mother was a godly woman who taught him the gospel, but then tragically died when he was only seven years old. Newton eventually strayed and followed his father off to a life at sea where he became a drunkard and by his own testimony, a blasphemer of God and of Christ and the captain of a ship and a company that sold African slaves for human property before eventually finally being converted back to the faith of his mother, which she had taught him in his early years during an awful shipwreck at sea where he thought he was going to lose his life. He later afterwards penned that famous hymn, the most famous of all of our hymns perhaps, and when he wrote wretch, he meant wretch. We might not like that word, but that's the word he chose and that's what he meant of his own life and of lives like his, amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me. For part two of our present series on the doctrines of grace, we're going to study this morning the Bible's teaching on our sin and we're turning here now after exploring last week's part one, last week God's majesty, God's grandeur, God's bigness, his utter separation from us, and before the next four weeks, the final four weeks, turning properly to God's grace, we're here this morning and we're starting here because our sin is the critical backdrop to exploring grace. Think about it, grace does not exist as a category apart from sin. Grace is something given which is undeserved. It's the opposite of what's deserved and grace is not a thing. We don't have the word or the category of grace if not for the clear category of sin. So do you love grace this morning? I know if you're here and you're a Christian this morning, I know you love grace and if you do, it's because you must know something of the horrors of sin. So if you have a Bible, turn with me to Romans chapter three. As I said, we'll be in different places for this topical series on the doctrines of grace, but mostly we'll be in Romans and in the book of John. Romans 11 last week, this morning we'll look at Romans three in the passage that Angela just read for us and this is the Apostle Paul's summary teaching on the doctrine of sin. He pulls together from all across the Old Testament and especially the Psalms, a symphony of sorts on sin and on our sin to make his point and we can trace, I wanna show you from this concophony of verses on our sin, we can trace three clear themes in these verses and I'm gonna give them to you now right up front and then we're gonna work through and observe together these three themes from Romans three on our sin. Number one, sin runs away from God. Number two, sin runs deep. And the third theme, sin runs everywhere. So sin runs away from God, sin runs deep within us and thirdly, sin runs everywhere and to everyone. So first theme I want to observe together with you, sin runs away from God. So in what direction does sin run? That's the first question, I wanna show you how Romans three answers this. In what direction does sin run? And here's the answer, it runs away from God. It runs, in another way, it runs in rebellion against God and I'm taking this from Paul's quoting in verse 11 of no one seeks for God. Here's the nature of your sin, here's the direction of your sin. No one seeks for God and then in verse 11, so the beginning and the end, the bookends of this little passage on sin, in verse 18, there is no fear of God before their eyes. So he begins with no one seeks for God and he ends with there is no fear of God before their eyes. In what direction does sin run? It runs away from God, it runs against God. No one seeks, Paul says. Let me read for you the fuller quote that Paul is pulling from here in verse 11. It comes actually from Psalm 14 and the same verses, the same words are quoted again later in Psalm 53. So twice the Psalms make the same point. Psalm 14 says this, the fool says in his heart, there is no God, they are corrupt, they do abominable deeds, there is none who does good. The Lord looks down from heaven on the children of man to see if there are any who understand, any who seek after God. Is there anyone who seeks God? They have all turned aside. Together they have all become corrupt. There is none who does good. No, not even one. Mankind, the psalmist is observing here, the glory of God's creation chose sin instead of God and in that moment, in the garden, a fall took place as man fell from his glorious heights, the pinnacle of all creation and created holy like God was holy. This Psalm is tracing that chaotic fall backwards like one walking off the edge, not realizing they're walking off the edge of a cliff. And so they're just falling and falling and falling and falling. Down we go, the psalmist observes. We fools said in our hearts, there is no God. So we all became, in a way, we all became atheists because we wanted it to be true. We wanted there to be no God. And then having become fools, we became falling still further, we became corrupted. We did abominable deeds. Now the psalmist says, God looks down from heaven and he who sees all and searches out everything begins an investigation upon all the earth and all the creation, everything under the sun and upon all of humanity, searching if there is one, just one who has understanding and who seeks after God, one seeker out there, one who does good and God Almighty finds none. All have turned aside from God and become corrupted. But what about the seeker, you would ask? What about the so-called seeker? What about that man that we like to talk about in that remote village far away that's never heard of the gospel, that's never heard of Jesus, what about that man? How can that man be judged? How can that woman be judged for not believing in a name he or she has never heard of? You've all heard that before, right? You've probably said that, you've probably asked that. It's a perennial problem, or so it represents itself, a problem for those of us who believe you must hear the name of Jesus to be saved, you must believe in Jesus to be saved. What about that man who's never had a chance to hear? The problem with that problem is that it imagines a man in a remote village who is just innocently walking along, doing his best, totally wanting, totally wishing, totally willing to follow God, who would seek God, but he's just never been given the opportunity. But that man, according to the Bible, does not exist. He's a figment of our imagination. No one seeks for God, Paul says. No one seeks for God, David says. No one seeks for God, all the Bible says. That man needs a missionary to preach the gospel just like we all need to hear the gospel because that man is not seeking God just like none of us were seeking God when God came to us and rescued us. No one comes to the Father, no one comes to me, Jesus says, unless my Father first draws him, John 6, 44. No one seeks, no one fears, Paul ends in verse 18. This time, Paul's quoting from Psalm 36. Let me read for you from Psalm 36. Transgression speaks to the wicked deep in his heart. There's no fear of God before his eyes, for he flatters himself in his own eyes that his iniquity cannot be found out and hated. Notice that in the Psalm, sin is speaking. Sin is pictured as speaking to the man, to the woman, from deep within his heart. What a terrifying image. Deep within us, sin is talking to us. But we all know that, we've all experienced that, haven't we? That's how sin works, doesn't it? It whispers to us, and it knows exactly what to say, and we listen to it because David writes, why? Why do we listen to that voice? Because there's no fear of God in our eyes. Kids, imagine yourself at home, near the kitchen, by an open jar of candy, an open jar of candy, which you've been forbidden to take anything from until later, and imagine, in this moment, you see, you remember that open jar of candy, and you know that dad is off at work, and you know that mom is upstairs getting ready. You can hear the blow dryer. You know you're safe. What do you do? Adults, you're watching television, and something lewd comes on, a commercial with something, really inappropriate images on it. Your spouse is sitting there beside you, so what do you do? You change the channel, you look away. That's easy to say if spouse is right there, accountability is right there. What about when they're gone? What do you do? What do you do when nobody's in the room, and you know it? That's what David here is saying, and Paul is citing from the Psalms. We all live with no fear of God in our eyes. We all live like God is not in the room, like he doesn't see, like there's no accountability, but don't miss it. Paul is saying we've all lost this fear of God. No one lives like God is in the room. No one fears God, Paul says. Jonathan Edwards, the great New England Puritan and pastor, once imagined in a sermon a scene taking place in heaven, and here's the scene. You are there standing before, so just imagine with me, with Edwards. You are there in the throne room of heaven, and you're standing before the throne of God, and you see with your own eyes, God Almighty get up out of his chair and walk out of the room. Imagination here, this isn't literal, and he walks out of the room, the room of heaven in which you're, the throne room, and he leaves vacant the throne of God the Almighty, and imagine you see him leave, and you know that in that chair, in that throne is all authority, all power, all glory, and yet you saw him leave, and you know that if you make it safely to that throne, nothing can then stop you. You will now have all authority, all power, all glory. Not, no, and you know, you know you can, let's say you know you can make it there safely. No angel can stop you. God is gone, and once you get there, it's a bad thing to get there if you get caught, but once you get there, all power's yours. What do you do? Jonathan Edwards said, every man and every woman in all of creation is dashing for that chair. That's the nature and the essence of sin. It runs away from God. It runs against God. It challenges God. It seeks his throne, his rule. That's the gravitational pull of sin. It is anti-God. It is rival to God. You and I have to understand this. Christians and churches and the Bible talk a lot about sin. Maybe you think we talk too much about sin. I've had more than a few conversations with people who do not like that, for instance, we do a prayer of confession every single week where we talk about sin and remember that we ourselves are still sinners every single week. Maybe you think we talk about it too much. You have to understand this. Sin is not merely mistakes, and so we're just dwelling on our mistakes. Sin is not, as many people primarily talk about it today, sin is not primarily brokenness, and so we're just refusing to move on from our broken past where we've been healed. That's not mainly what sin is. Sin, most fundamentally, is anti-God rebellion. It is not a personal decision that just affects you, and so it's nobody else's business. It's against somebody. It's always targeting somebody, namely God. It is a revolt we've all shared in against the king of kings. It is the dethronement of God. We've all committed treason against the king. Sin runs directionally away from God and against God. The second theme I wanna show you from Romans 3 and all that Paul quotes from here is that sin runs deep. How deeply does sin affect us? Paul's answer here is that it touches and taints all of us. Paul captures this second point. I'm taking this second point by his assembling all these verses from the Old Testament which include all these different references to our entire bodies. Did you notice the emphasis on our bodies in this passage? Look again. Verse 13, their throat is an open grave. Verse 13, they use their tongues to deceive. Verse 13, still, the venom of asps, that's a viper, is under their lips. Verse 14, their mouth is full of curses and bitterness. Verse 15, their feet are swift to shed blood. Verse 18, one more, there is no fear of God before their eyes. Do you hear all the body parts? Throat, tongues, lips, mouths, feet, eyes, everything. What do you leave out? Elbows, all of us. How deeply does sin run? It runs into and touches all of us. Many of you have on your driver's license in the corner you have a small little blue, I think it's blue, heart. No, it's red, a little heart logo in the corner of your driver's license signifying that you're an organ donor. That means, God forbid, if you lost your life, you have given permission to the state to potentially take some of your organs and donate them to somebody else still alive who needs a new heart or new lungs or whatever. In 2018, Stephen Hawking died and there was a frenzy of universities, hospitals, and medical researchers all pleading and petitioning for the rights to his brain. Why? Because Hawking was considered by many to be the most intelligent man alive and so all these researchers wanted to study his brain to unlock the secrets of his genius. Now, what a bizarre thought that even after you're dead, a part of your body could still be alive and still be useful and could still serve somebody else. You're dead, you're in the dirt, but your heart is pumping inside somebody else's body. What a bizarre thought. But Paul's vivid imagery here is meant to show us how deeply and how totally sin has infected all of us so that no single part of us is left untainted. In other words, because of sin, none of you, none of me is spiritually alive. No single part of you has even just a spark of spiritual good in it that God might use. You know, he might pour out and turn that into something good. Apart from grace, no part of me is redeemable. No part of me commends me to God. Everything and all of me, Paul is saying, condemns me, guilty, guilty. My own body parts, my own words cry out against me. Now, at some level, we all know this. Even if you don't like it, at some level, we all know this and this is why we try to mask our sin. Something in us, honestly, by the mercy of God, cries out guilty within us if God hasn't utterly given us over to ourselves and to our sin, as Romans 1 warns about, Romans 1. And so when that cries out guilty, we try to cover up our shame for our sins by using masks. This is as old, by the way, as Adam, who in the garden after he takes the bait, after he sins and after he immediately awakens to his shame and his nakedness, what does he do? He sows fig leaves to try to cover himself. He creates a mask. We all do the same thing ever since Adam, ever since Eve in response to our sin. We all do this in some very repeatable ways. We tend to use the same basic masks. Let me give you three primary masks we all often try to put on to try and cover our sins, probably not realizing that's what we're doing. Mask number one, the mask of comparison. We can always feel better about ourselves by looking at somebody worse. And when you're really struggling to find somebody worse, there's always Hitler. Second mask, the mask of good deeds. You just laughed at a joke about Hitler. I didn't laugh. The mask of good deeds. We volunteer, we serve the poor, we find genuinely wonderful things to do. And let me be clear, these are wonderful things to do, but we do them, why? We do them to cover up or to somehow outweigh the darkness and the shame that we know and feel in our own hearts. One more, third, the mask of religion. We go to church, we fast, we pray five times a day, all facing in the right direction, why? We write out rules and we follow them all and we put our families under rules, religious rules, why? So that we can feel safe and secure before God and so that we can feel set apart and different from the rest of the world in their sins. You see all three of those masks at play, by the way, in Jesus' famous, and I think one of the most important parables he gives in all the Bible, his famous parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector. Do you remember that parable? A rotten tax collector comes into the temple, stands far off at a distance, beats his chest, and cries out, God have mercy on me, a wretched sinner. He calls himself a wretch, not really, but I'm taking some liberties. God have mercy on me, a sinner. Meanwhile, at the front of the temple, in a place of prominence, there stands a Pharisee. And what does he do? He compares, he puts on the mask of comparison. God, I thank you that I am not like other men, especially this tax collector. He calls him out by name. He puts on and hides behind the mask of good deeds. He prays to God out loud. I don't extort others like this tax collector. I'm not an adulterer. He feels safe before his and beneath his mask of religion. I fast twice a week, he says. I give tithes of all that I get. I pray out loud like I'm praying right now. Do you see what he's doing? All his masks, all his fig leaves, Jesus sees right through those masks. I tell you, Jesus concludes, that tax collector went home justified, saved before God and not the Pharisee. And God help us because there's a Pharisee inside all of us, isn't there? How do you look at somebody who struggles with sins you don't struggle with? Say sexual sin. How do you look at them? How do you think about them? How do you feel about somebody whose marriage is quite obviously really struggling? How do you feel after you engage with somebody who's just gone through a divorce? This little series we're doing is a doctrinal, a series about doctrines. So we're studying a number of doctrines all related to grace over these six weeks. And this morning, the name for the doctrine we're studying and I'm teaching you right now is called total depravity. Total depravity. It doesn't mean that every single one of us is as depraved as we can possibly be. We're not all Hitler. Even Hitler probably had some redeemable qualities. Nobody's as depraved as they could possibly be. But we all, and without exception, and all of us totally, think of the body parts, all of us are depraved. This doctrine that I'm teaching you right now, I'm showing you from Romans three, is probably the most despised doctrine of everything I'm gonna show you in these six weeks. People don't wanna talk about it. Many people reject it because depravity is a really strong word. It does not refer to mistakes. It refers to something deeper than that. It does not refer to some outward bad choices we've made. We all can acknowledge that. We all do that. It refers to something deeper than that, something in us. It refers to our very natures. That's what it's talking about. Our natures, the deepest, most fundamental part of who we are, depraved, fallen, dead, the apostle Paul says elsewhere in Ephesians chapter two. We were dead in our trespasses and sins, Ephesians two, verse one. You're not in trouble as a sinner. You're not a little wayward as a sinner. You're depraved, dead, a wretch apart from Christ. I don't need a bath or a little washing from my sins. I need CPR is what the Bible's teaching. I need resurrection. Sin runs away from God. Sin runs deep down to our very cores. And thirdly, finally, the last theme I wanna show you from Romans three, nine through 20, sin runs everywhere. Sin runs everywhere and to everyone. Who does sin touch? Jew and Gentile is Paul's answer. Man and woman, man and child, everywhere, everyone. I'm taking this from verses nine and 10 to begin with. Look at nine again. What then? Paul, a token Jew, says what then? Are we Jews any better off? No, not at all. For we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin. As it is written, none is righteous. No, not one. Notice the universal language he uses throughout this passage. Notice the all of verse nine, A-L-L, all. And notice the none of verse 10, none. And the no one, which Paul mentions in verse 11, twice. And the all, again, of verse 12. And then another no one, no one does good, not even one. And then notice finally the stunning conclusion of verse 19, so that. Here's the case that Paul, the prosecutor, has been building to. Here's his triumphant conclusion in verse 19. So that every mouth may be stopped and the whole world may be held accountable to God. For by works of the law, no human being will be justified in his sight. This was one of the more important points of Jesus' teaching. It's the same for Paul. Nobody is righteous, even God's people. The Jews disobeyed God's law, and so they thought the law would spare them. We got the law, we have the law. But they didn't keep it, so the law condemned them. This totally undermines, by the way, just as an aside, this teaching totally undermines racism. And I hope you can easily see that because the Bible teaches that all are under sin. What does racism do? It elevates one race, one ethnicity above another, and it assumes that this race is better than, it might not say that out loud, but that's the premise of all racism. We're better than, our race is better. They haven't been taught well enough. They're more depraved than us. Do you see the, it would be comical if it weren't so atrocious. Do you see the ridiculous, the absurdity of that? All, all, Jew, Gentile, black, white, all are under sin. John Piper said that the doctrine of total depravity gives us, quote, a desperate camaraderie of condemnation. All my brothers and sisters of every tribe, tongue, and nation condemned just like me. And put your eyes on verse nine and that little phrase, under sin. We have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are, I want you to stare at this little phrase, under sin. All are under sin. It doesn't say in sin, though that would obviously be true. It doesn't say around sin, though that would also obviously be true. It says under sin, under sin. Think about that. He's creating a picture here, an illustration, and the picture is of someone under something else's rule. It's a picture of imprisonment. Of slavery. The image here, the idea is that we're all, Jew and Gentile, under sin's tyranny. So that you can't not sin apart from Jesus. Sin has you in its claws. It reigns over you. You are under this awful prisoner called sin. That's exactly, by the way, what Paul says later in Romans six when he says that we are all, we all were enslaved under sin until Christ came and broke us free from those chains. Now, I want you to see this because this is so critical and so powerful. The irony at work here. The lie of sin, the promise, which was a lie of sin from the very beginning, was for freedom. Think about this. Why did Adam and Eve, it was an apple or whatever fruit it was, why did they take the fruit of the tree? Because what did the serpent promise? He promised freedom. You'll be like God. No more laws, no more rules. That's still the lie of sin, by the way. It still claims to offer freedom. No rules, no law, no God. And that's why we take that bait every time because that's what we want. That's what the world wants so badly, freedom. Psalm two captures this so powerfully when it says of the nations raging against God and raging in their sin. Why do the nations rage? The psalmist asked. And why do the people's plot in vain? The kings and the rulers of the earth set themselves together against the Lord and against his anointed one. Why? What is the cry of their heart? Quote, let us burst his bonds apart. Let us burst his bonds apart and set ourselves free from his cords. What is the cry of their hearts? Why do they hate God? Because they think God has them in chains. They think they're prisoners and they think if they overthrow God, they think if they get rid of God, they'll finally be free. I read just recently Gerard Piquet. Any of you watch international football, soccer? It's soccer. Football is our sport. International soccer, Gerard Piquet was a really famous and one of the best in the world defenders for Barcelona. And until recently was married to Shakira. That Shakira, the only Shakira. He, Gerard Piquet took an interview with El Pais. I'm sure I'm saying that wrong. Spanish newspaper, big Spanish newspaper. After cheating on his wife and busting up his marriage, here's a quote from the interview he did with El Pais. Quote, I will keep doing what I want. The day that I die, I will look back and I hope I have always done what I wanted. Can you believe that? I want to be faithful to myself. I'm very happy. There have been big changes in my life before and I've still known how to preserve happiness, end quote. His God is freedom. And I'm not picking on him just to pick on him. I'm picking on him because I think his words are the cry of all of our hearts. All of us want freedom. Who doesn't want freedom? But that's the lie of sin. Little kids mutilating their bodies right now in the name of freedom. Is that freedom? Taking 30 women for pleasure, is that freedom? You give yourself to that. You feel free when you're done? Killing the miracle of life, growing inside your own body. Freedom? Sin promises freedom always. That's why it's so alluring. But behind its cloak is slavery. It has you and it rules over you. Tyranny. You and I were born with a will enslaved to sin. That's what original sin means, by the way. Original sin, you've surely heard that before. It's not actually just referring to what was the first sin. It's referring to the consequences of that first sin. Namely, because of, this is exactly what Paul teaches in Romans five. Because of Adam's sin and Eve's sin, they, as the first humans and as the representatives of all other humans, they have given to us, bequeathed to us a sin nature. Thank you, Adam and Eve. Mom and dad times 1,000 or a trillion, whatever. We were born with an enslaved will to sin. We're all the same in that way. We were all born that way. No exceptions. And so Paul concludes this passage. Let every mouth be stopped and the whole world accountable to God. Here, this is a packed out courtroom. Everyone in all the universe, Jew, Gentile, man, woman, adult, child, everyone is on trial and everyone is clamoring, everyone is yelling, crying out for their own innocence, using excuses. But God, what about my circumstances? What about my parents? Everyone is using comparison. But God, look at him, he's way worse than me. Everyone is using, crying out about their good deeds. But God, I gave to the poor. But God, I go to church. But now God has showed up in the courtroom with his law and in his holiness. Now everyone has seen no more excuses, none are righteous, and the room goes silent. Every mouth is stopped, Paul says. Every single mouth, every single person, every single nation in all the world, quiet. In 2020, during the middle of the pandemic, they started canceling professional sports. Awful. But the NBA, I'm sure many of you will remember, created the so-called bubble. Remember the bubble? To finish its season and still have the playoffs. They constructed a $200 million biodome city. Amazing. In Disney World, where players and select personnel and nobody else were let in. Only after, for a couple weeks, testing negative for COVID. And then they kept them in under very strict protocols. The season in this bubble ran from July to October without a single case of COVID. The bubble actually worked. How remarkable is that, by the way? I didn't get enough credit for that. It was unbelievable science, real-life people experiment. They successfully created an island of safety, a bubble with no virus or threat of the virus. There is no remote island or bubble you can retreat to where things are untainted by sin. And if there were just one island yet undiscovered, the moment that you showed up or I showed up, it would be spoiled and ruined, poisoned by sin. Everyone, all, Jew and Gentile, has been poisoned by the disease of sin. Even worse, we're born into it. There is no hope for any of us. And you must get here in your mind and in your heart. You must get here for here is where Jesus fits into the story. The man who was from God and who was God. And so he wasn't like the rest of us born into sin and born with a sin nature. The man who, though he was tempted by the devil and though he was tempted in every way like we are, Hebrews says, he never once sinned. The man who came under the law, just like every Jew had come under the law and who obeyed the law. And so the law did not condemn him as it does us and everyone else. The law for the first time and the only time in all the history of the world made a different declaration of him who was the first one to pass its test, not guilty, righteous. He ought to have, then and there, having passed it, he ought to have just ascended straight into heaven like Enoch or Elijah from the Old Testament or something even more spectacular since, unlike them, he had never sinned. But he didn't. At least not first. Not before first ascending upon a cross where he was tortured and punished, where the apostle Paul says, as we read earlier, he became sin, where he was treated by his father like he himself was the very essence of sin and all sin and so where the fullness of God's wrath was poured out upon him and into him for your dirty thoughts and my greed and selfishness. No fig leaves for the son of God at Calvary. He was exposed in his nakedness for our shame, our shame before all. He took sin with him, our sin, and he took it into the tomb and there he conquered it and he stripped it of its power and there he buried it forever before rising from the dead as victor and as king and as the king who conquered sin. Now there is an island of righteousness. Now there is an untainted bubble which has not been touched by sin. There's only one in all the world and it's a man, the crucified and now risen son of God. I have to ask, have you taken refuge in him? That's the only way you or any of us, anybody will ever be forgiven of our sins and set free and fully forgiven and fully free if you'll believe in him and take him as your refuge. None of our masks will ever stand before the judgment of God. Are you kidding me? Only Christ and only his righteousness can ever actually cover our sins. Have you taken refuge in Christ? Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me. I once was lost but now I'm found, was blind but now I see. God, thank you for being honest with us about our sin for what could stop you from not even telling us how guilty we were and just immediately judging us upon our death. You'd be fully just to do that and yet you've been honest with us and even more you've shown us a way to forgiveness and refuge and safety and real freedom in Christ. And so God, we pray you would set us free as your people from pretending, from pretending like we're better than we are, from hiding, from hiding our sins from others, from acting like we can hide our sins from you. God, set us free to find full forgiveness and joy in Jesus such that we might actually begin by your spirit to put sin to death and to live in the new life which Christ has purchased for us. God, I pray for those here among us, young and old, who have not yet found refuge in Christ. I pray that you would awaken in their hearts now faith to believe and to run to Jesus. For Jesus said, none, none will ever come to me unless my Father draws them. And so we call upon you now, oh great God and Father in heaven to draw their hearts to you. And we pray all these things in Jesus' name, amen.
