So today's our five-year anniversary. Five years ago yesterday, actually, but it was a Saturday this year. Five years ago yesterday, we had our first public worship service. I wonder if I could do this really quickly. How many of you were there? Could you, sorry, could you stand, no, stand up, don't raise your hand, stand up if you were there at our first worship service at Creighton's Corner Elementary School in Brambleton, September the 16th of 2018. Check that out. You can be seated. I think that's so wonderful and so encouraging. I think, I think 22 of our original founding 39 members are still members of this church, and I want to say just as encouraging those of you who remain seated just now. That wasn't a public exercise to shame the rest of you or to even exalt those of us who were standing because glory to God for both of you because God has brought you here and continues to bring you here as he continues to build his church, and it's all kindness. Those of you who are still with us five years later, unbelievable kindness of God. Those of you who are here, have been here since then, joined since then, some of you are here for the very first time. You have no idea how you even got here if you're going to come back. It's all the kindness of God, and we're grateful you're all here. Five years is a really short amount of time, and it also feels like an eternity, especially when you think about planting a church, meeting in a school, setting up and tearing down. Glory to God that we don't have to do that anymore. A pandemic, Zoom meetings kicked out of the school, masks and social distancing required for us to meet again in the school, elders and deacons being added, a building, a move to Leesburg, a big move at the time, you remember that? Baptisms, weddings, more and more weddings, a million babies being born. Another one this week, Mark and Juliana Cruz. Welcome, Kyle. Kyle Cruz, and even more than that, so, so, so, so, so, so much Papa John's pizza over the last five years. So, on behalf of Dave and myself, and so many others, my wife, I just cite us two because we were the two pastors, if you can even call us that, two guys who moved here to pastor a church that doesn't yet exist, who moved here having no idea what God was going to do, and really, if we can let our secrets out now, really no idea what we were doing, I just want to say publicly how grateful we are for all of you and above all to God for all this kindness to us. Jesus has been raised from the dead and has arranged for the 11 remaining disciples to meet him in the hills, the mountains of Galilee. If you're not already in Matthew 28, you can go ahead and turn there, our little three-week series trying to re-anchor us as a church as we cross five years into the heart of Jesus' mission for this church and for every church. The 11 disciples have met Jesus in the hills of Galilee. They've seen him raised from the dead. They worshiped him. Some doubted, if you can believe it. He's just claimed all authority in heaven and on earth, all authority in heaven and on earth, and on the basis of Jesus' authority, which we looked at last week, he now sends out his followers, the original 11, and every single follower since, including you and us this morning. If you're a follower of Jesus, all these generations later, he sends them all out onto a mission into all the earth, into all the nations. A radical claim last week. I have, it has been granted to me, Jesus says, all authority in heaven and on earth. A radical mission this week. Verse 19 of chapter 28, go therefore and make disciples, go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I'm with you always until the end of the age, which we'll consider next week. Radical mission for us to explore together this week. Go, the word go, which begins verse 19, is actually a participle. And so it could be translated as going or as you're going. Baptize and teach are also participles. So baptizing and teaching, it could be translated as as you are going into all the nations. And so it could carry the sense of wherever you are, maybe you've, maybe you've heard that teaching on this passage. And I do think there's something helpful about that observation that this is a wherever you are and as you are going and as you're always going. But I want to point out this as well. Jesus said this in such a way. This is written and recorded by Matthew in such a way that the going. Is given emphasis and priority in the command itself. It comes first, which is why translations like mine and maybe yours have it written like a command. It doesn't say as you are going, it says go. If I could put it like this, he's saying, hey, hey, going. On your way, he says, sending pointing almost on your way, he says, with emphasis. I like to run sort of not in a serious or weird way. And when I first started running, I strongly preferred the treadmill. Any, any diehard treadmillers out there? I could watch a show. Not many of you, evidently there's air conditioning. Always. I just didn't understand why people would run outside where there are bugs, where it's either too hot or too cold, where there are hills, you got to go up and where there's above all, no ESPN. And then I started running outside and I got it. The trees, the air, the adventure of it all, the trees, the air, the adventure of it all new sites and sounds and smells with every stride. Even if you run the same path again and again, every day, every run something new. After my conversion, so to speak, I tried the treadmill a few times afterwards and have since. And so in the dead of winter, when it's just too cold or in the, the doldrums of summer, when it's too hot and I just couldn't do it outside anymore, I've, I tried the treadmill again and I just couldn't do it anymore. It's awful. The monotony of it all, just absolutely terrible working so hard, but not going anywhere the whole time, just staying in place like a hamster. Every church from the first in Jerusalem to every church today, including this one was given. Every church was given the same set of instructions from Jesus. Every church from Jesus to today was sent on this same mission, but listen, what so easily happens and it happens all the time is churches don't obey this mission. Why? Well, obvious reasons. It's hard. It's daring. It requires real faith in Jesus' claim to have all authority. And we prefer comfort. We prefer the company and security of our own people and all those who already agree with us. And we're terrified of them. Who do you define as them? Also, aren't they, them, our enemies? Aren't they the people with the evil worldview, the people trying to get rid of us? And so churches disobey the mission all the time. Churches disobey the mission. They don't participate in the mission, but here's what they do to ease their consciences. They lie to themselves. They trick themselves. You see, they don't just sit there. They're the busiest people in the world. The calendar is full with wonderful things, which have nothing at all to do with making disciples. They're running around and sweating and tired and fatigued, and they haven't moved an inch. They're on a treadmill. They're indoors, comfortably sitting inside the air conditioning, working so hard and going absolutely nowhere. And yet, having run so much and worked so hard, having nothing left to give to the world. Jesus sends them out, the original 11 and everyone's sins, on the basis of his authority, all authority in heaven and on earth, and he sends them out, you see, to all nations. Go, therefore, Jesus says, as you're going off you go, and go where, Jesus? To all nations, he says. Go, therefore, to all nations. Again, just a little work here to make sure we understand this command, this most basic central command to Jesus for the church. What does he mean? Who does he mean when he says all nations? You and I hear that, and what do we think? We think countries. We think the beginning, the opening ceremony of every Olympics where they bring out representatives from every competing country, and I always realized how poorly I paid attention in elementary geography class. There's no way that's a country. You ever feel that watching the Olympics? Nauru, Tuvalu, Kiribati? Don't, don't judge me. Y'all didn't know those were countries. There's no way you guys, you guys watch. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember that one comes after the other one that starts with a T. Get out of here. Well, what did Jesus' disciples hear when he sent them to all the nations? Panta ta ethne, all the nations. Let me tell you two things just briefly, which they surely heard, which are instructive for us. First, nations throughout the Bible refers to tribes, to people groups. Think of Genesis, which I've been preaching through for a long time, and I'm going to return to after we finish this little series. Think of Genesis and all the different tribes you encounter. Think of Abraham in Genesis 14, defeating the five kings. Who are those five kings? Those five kings are five leaders of what Genesis calls nations, which were likely what we think of more as like small city-states and towns. It's people with a shared lineage, speaking the same language, sharing a common culture, nations. That's the first thing they would have heard. Secondly, remember, this is essential, remember that the original 11 disciples were Jews, meaning they were the people of God with all the promises of God. They were the people of God in the Old Testament under the Old Covenant. Remember that Jesus, their king and their commander himself was a Jew. And actually earlier in Matthew 10, you don't have to turn there, but Jesus sent them out earlier to preach. This isn't the first time he sent them out, but earlier when he sent them out to preach, he sent them out to preach to Israel. Matthew 10 verse 5, these 12 disciples Jesus sent out instructing them, go nowhere among the Gentiles. The word there is the ethnic, the nations, the Gentiles. Go nowhere among the Gentiles and enter no town of the Samaritans, but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. The first sending out of Jesus, he says, don't go to the nations. Now he sends them after his resurrection from the dead to all the nations. So, so what did they hear? They heard tribes or people groups, and they also heard outsiders, not my people, not Israel, not the Jews. And I want to suggest that's what we should hear this morning. And this really matters. According to one agency, there are more than 17,000 people groups in all the world today. That's people with a shared language, shared culture. And according to the same agency of those 17,000 people groups, 7,414 of those are classified as unreached. Meaning, not meaning, oh, there's, there's not that many Christians who live there, people who have been reached and believe the gospel, meaning rather they have little to no access to the gospel. Most people in Loudoun County don't believe the gospel, but everybody in Loudoun County has plenty of access to the gospel. They can come to this church or any other gospel preaching church around Loudoun County. They can pick up a Bible anywhere they like to, and they can read it in their own language. There are 7,414 people groups, shared language and culture without that access. And this has to be our concern and every church's concern who has the gospel and churches like us in places like ours, which are so rich with gospel resources, relatively speaking. But I want to say more than that, because as much as that matters, again, those, those disciples were sent to nations and people groups, but they were also sent to outsiders, which begs another question. Who are outsiders today? Who are outsiders to us? Groups of people sharing the common culture who are often overlooked and isolated. Who are those today? I just want to get you started and turn your imagination on because two immediately come to mind. This is obviously not an exhaustive list. I'm just going to call out and cite two just to make the point, and I hope just to stoke your imagination. First, the homeless. Is there a more overlooked and isolated community in all the world than the homeless? And how should we think about that? Second, I want to mention the LGBTQ community. And it is truly a community with a shared culture and values, and they stick closer together and more closely together than just about any other community you can observe in this world. Tightly they stick together, and Jesus sends us to them as well. He sends us to outsiders. He sends us to sinners. Such were all of us. Yeah, I just hung out with a friend who just planted a church, and they recently celebrated their very first baptism of a devoted homosexual who they pursued and prayed for and then preached the gospel to and invited him to repent and believe, and he did. And they welcomed him, and they baptized him, and he now belongs to their community, the community of Jesus, because they went to him. They obeyed Jesus. Who are outsiders in our world? Who are outsiders in your world? Or maybe they're not in your world because we've just let them and left them alone as outsiders. And how can you and I and how can we go to them, Jesus says. The early church, historians tell us, grew so rapidly. Sociologists estimate that the first four centuries of the early church—remember, it's just a few scattered, it's just 11 right now—then in Jerusalem, it's a few more. Isolated in Israel, in Jerusalem, historians tell us that the early church grew by 40 percent every decade for those first four centuries. Unbelievable rapid growth. They were a force in the world by 400 years. Historians also tell us that the dominant majority of those early first four-century Christians were from the lower caste of society. Not the universities. They reached the lower caste, and they changed the world. The gospel, I remember Mez McConnell on this stage saying, doesn't flow downstream, it flows upstream. Jesus sends us out to the unreached and to the overlooked, to every tongue and to every tribe and to every nation. What a blessing, if I could just comment. What a blessing to have so many in our church who are having, just having, or recently having returned from serving the Lord in less-reached places by the gospel for the sake of the gospel. The Gazinsky serving in Ras Al-Khaimah, Carly, who's with us now for a season, and then will return to the Czech Republic. Obviously the Goyles from Delhi, who were with us for a good long season. Even Hope, who's new to this church and coming into membership now from Thailand, where she served. I could also mention as well those who have moved away from us, which is always sad, but there's a wonderful side effect of those who move away from us and now live as Christians in more difficult-to-reach areas. Matt and Grace Davis in Paris, and Ryan and Samantha Cave in Rome, where Ryan serves as an elder in a wonderful church in the heart of Rome, and others as well. And of course how richly God has blessed us with our partnerships over these last five years, with like-minded churches and pastors serving Christ and laboring for his church all over the world. Zhenya and Ben serving at the Trinity Church of Minsk in war-plagued, divided Belarus. Blaine, while he was serving in Kuwait City for the sake of the gospel. Taras Tarkovsky, by no one's intention other than the providence of God, now serving at the Holy Trinity Church of Warsaw in Poland. Gerald, in the schemes of Edinburgh, laboring for the gospel. By the way, he'll be at PHC this week, preaching in your chapel. Can't wait to see you there. I want to be clear, we're nothing special, and some of this is just incidental. It's not like we planned for all this. We're just trying to play our small part, like every other gospel church, to obey this basic command of Jesus. And oh for the grace of God to be so kind in time to raise up some of you, some of you adults, maybe some of you who are right now kids, to go and live and serve for the sake of some people group who are yet unreached by the gospel, for the sake of Christ our King who has all authority in heaven and on earth. Wouldn't that be something? Jesus sends them out, sends us out, on the basis of his all authority. He sends them out to all nations. He sends them out to outsiders. And what are we to do? Just run around to all the nations. What are we? He doesn't send us out as tourists to vacation in every nation. What are we to do? Here and there and wherever God places us and wherever we go, what are we to do? Three things I want you to see in this passage this morning. We are to, we are sent out to make disciples, mark disciples, mature disciples. Jesus sends us out and he sends us out to do three things, all of us. Make disciples, mark disciples, and mature disciples. First he sends us out to make disciples. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations. This famous commission is written, it only, this mission here has one verb, one command in it. Only one command and it's this word, make disciples. What does it mean though? That's the one thing we're commanded to do. What does it mean? What is a disciple and what does it mean therefore to make disciples? Let me say a few things about disciples and the making of disciples. First let me comment, and this, guys, this is our job. If you're a Christian, if you're a part of this church or any church, this is your job. This is our job. What does it mean to make disciples? First, it is more than evangelism, but it's not less than evangelism. Evangelism, of course, means sharing the gospel, the good news with somebody for the first time. Sharing the gospel, trying to persuade somebody who does not yet believe the gospel, who has not yet bowed to Jesus as king. Making disciples is more than evangelism, but it's not less than evangelism. As we'll see in the rest of this passage, evangelism is really just the beginning, but it is the beginning. So making disciples begins by sharing the gospel, which raises some fun questions for us to ask. Who was the last person you shared the gospel with? Maybe some painful questions to ask. Who's the last person you shared the gospel with? Who's the last person you told that Jesus died to forgive sinners of all their sins? Who is the last person that you told that God then raised him from the dead, accepting his sacrifice, and crowning him as king of kings, as king of heaven and earth, who has all authority in heaven and on earth? Who was the last person you told that? Who are you praying for opportunities to share this gospel with right now? In the beginning of Matthew's gospel, in the beginning of Jesus' gathering of disciples to himself, his first instructions to them were what? He said, follow me and I will make you fishers of men. This is basic to following Jesus. This is basic to being a disciple yourself. Following Jesus is becoming a fisher of men and of women, making other disciples. So it all starts with evangelism, but it doesn't end there. The job's not done. The idea is so much more than gathering as many converts as one possibly can. Disciples are more than converts. Yes, I believe. I'm in. Good. We're done. No, we're not done. The word for disciple, it's methete. It means learner, and the idea is a lifelong follower, a lifelong learner, learning the ways of Jesus. Jesus said in John 8, 31, if you abide in my word, then you are truly my disciples. Lots of people hear the word, even make a profession of faith. They're not disciples, Jesus says. Those who hear it, receive it, believe it, and abide in it, remain in it, learn it, live it, they are truly my disciples. If the point is just to get the tally as high as possible, as many converts, as many, yes, yes, yes, it's just to get that number as high as possible, then what we should be doing is making our music and our service and our preaching as entertaining as we possibly can to draw in as many people as possible, the biggest crowd possible, lipstick on a pig or whatever it takes, but that's not the mission that Jesus gave to the church. The question is not what will draw the biggest crowd or even make the most converts. Jesus drew huge crowds, and then once they heard his message, it dwindled down to a dozen. The point is to make disciples. That is, the point is to, by the power of the Spirit, to make committed lifelong learners and followers of the ways of Jesus. Discipleship is certainly teaching and understanding more on that in a moment, but it's more even than that. It's all of life under the Lordship of Christ. It's all of life under the Lordship of Christ. Let me tell you about, just briefly, two deeply impactful moments in my life and in my history. Number one, Washington DC, 2010. I was doing a pastoral internship and asked one of the pastors if he would meet with me. I had no agenda other than to spend time with a pastor because I was training and wanted to be a pastor. He said sure, and he invited me and my family over. My family was just me and my wife at this time. He invited us over to his house, which was right beside the church, and he invited us over 40 minutes before a Wednesday night Bible study began, which we were both obligated to go to. I thought that was super weird, but whatever. I went over to his house. He and his wife were finishing dinner with their four kids. Part of us is thinking like, did they double schedule here? Did they not think about this too well? And then they were getting them ready to walk over to the church, but all the while sitting there and talking to me and my wife, while parenting their kids, while getting ready for church, while utter chaos was happening. Moment number two, Oklahoma City, 2012. We were invited again over to dinner with friends who became really close friends during our time out there. They also at the time had a bunch of little kids, and so dinner was absolute chaos once again, and then after dinner he, the gentleman who invited us, called his kids into the living room and invited me also to join them in there. Great, whatever. I like kids. So I went in there, and with his kids gathered around him, half of them literally hanging off of him, he read them through a kid's Bible story and asked them questions. It was total chaos once again. They interrupted him constantly. There's zero chance any of them understood any of the Bible story, and it was all over in four or five minutes. He prayed for them, and then he sent them to get to bed and to brush their teeth, and it was all remarkably unimpressive, and yet here I am talking about it more than a decade later and citing both moments as deeply impactful in my life. Why? Because I learned something really profound in both of those moments, and I learned both lessons with my eyes. I was just watching two very normal Christians do very normal things, getting ready for church, eating dinner, getting ready for bed, and doing it in totally unimpressive and yet a distinctly purposely Christian way. I learned in both moments that people I really respected, and honestly in both cases I wanted to grow up to be like them someday, I learned that people I really respected did stuff in a way that I could totally do. Anybody could do it. They weren't catechizing their children in Latin. Had I seen that, I would have been impressed. I would also probably judge them, and I would have thought, yeah, I'm not doing that. I learned in those moments that in busyness and chaos, you can still help other Christians to follow Jesus, and actually at the second meeting, the dinner with the bedtime story, we had our first daughter with us at the time, who was just a baby, and a few years later after that, we had more kids, and they were a little older by that time, and we'd on occasion have church members over for dinner at our house, and often younger church members, singles or newly marrieds without kids, and I'd invite them at the end of dinner into my kids' room where I'd read Bible to my girls and let them see the same entirely unremarkable, repeatable things which I learned a few years before by watching others. That's discipleship. All of life, all the mess and chaos of life, all of it under the lordship of Christ, and then handing it down and down and down to others. That's discipleship. This is Jesus' command, his mission for every believer. This is, listen to me, this is part of what it means to be a Christian. You say you're a Christian. You say you follow Jesus. Following Jesus includes helping others to follow Jesus. It includes being a fisher of men and of women. A Christian is someone who has placed all their trust in Jesus and who follows Jesus now with all their life, so nothing is off limits. Does that describe you? Not perfect. Oh my goodness, come and hang out with me, and I'll show you just how imperfect we are. Not everything perfectly, but with all of our imperfections, with all of our mess and chaos, everything under the lordship of Jesus. Nothing off limits. Words, thoughts, work, wallets, relationships, sex, sexuality, everything under the lordship of Jesus. That's discipleship, and part of following Christ is helping others to follow Christ, is making disciples. So if you understand yourself, making disciples, so if you understand yourself to be a follower of Jesus again, and you in no way are helping anybody else to follow Jesus, hear me carefully, then you're either a severely stunted, and I would even say, I don't mean this in a in a condemning way, a severely irregular Christian you are, or you're not a Christian at all. This is not a command for the super spiritual. This is not an assignment specifically given to pastors or missionaries. This is my job. This is your job. This is our job. If you want to ruin Christianity in a generation, see your pastors as the sole disciples in your church and community, and see yourselves, make yourselves into the audience, who just pays the guys to do it. Christianity in a generation gone. This is given to all churches and to every single one of us. How are you helping to make disciples? And if you aren't, and I imagine some of you right now are feeling the weight of all I'm saying, and I'm just trying to aim God's word at you, at us, if you aren't, and what I'm saying right now makes you feel something like overwhelmed or maybe even ashamed, let me encourage you with this basic advice. Your first step, if that's you, is probably to be discipled yourself, to be more discipled yourself, to ask somebody else who you, you just see them following Jesus, they're a little bit ahead of you, to ask them to help you to follow Jesus. And that's one of the wonderful things that the church is to be all about. People ask me, hey, can you, can you matchmake me with somebody all the time? No happier request to receive. We're to make disciples. Secondly, we're to mark disciples. Jesus sends them out and us out to mark disciples. He says, not just making disciples, he fills that out by saying baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. We're to baptize them, Jesus says. So Jesus commands the church and his followers to make disciples. Everything else he says in this passage is fleshing that out, explaining further and specifically how we're to make disciples, and they're to be marked, notice, by the sign and ceremony of baptism. Baptism is the first act of the disciples. It's the, it's the very first, it's the, it's the entry point into discipleship. You want to follow Jesus? You say you believe? Wonderful. First, identify yourself as a follower of Jesus. And you do that, you identify, you come out, as it were, according to Jesus, by baptism. Baptism does not save you. Not even a little bit. It doesn't make you more saved. What it does is it marks you as a disciple of Jesus. One of the questions I get asked, we get asked all the time, as a church, as a pastor, is why does your church require baptism to take the Lord's Supper? Which, for the record, most churches throughout church history have required baptism before the Lord's Supper, I'm just saying. But this is why. Because baptism is Jesus' first command. It's the entryway into discipleship. It's the way that he's called us, the only way, to come out as his followers and identify. Baptism is the initiating sign, whereas the Lord's Supper is the staying sign, is how Christians in history have put it. It's the entry point which is required for the continuing, staying point. You get married, the wedding is the entry point, and then you consummate the marriage. You join the team, you put on the jersey, and now you're permitted to run around on the field with all the players who are on your team. Now, if I wanted to make a point to all my paedo-baptist friends in the room, who I love and am genuinely thankful for and have learned so much from, and none of that was sarcasm whatsoever, but if I wanted to make a point at this juncture of four, all my paedo-baptist friends in particular, I would point out that baptizing here comes after making disciples. In other words, the who for baptism, who are you to baptize? Disciples of Jesus. Not children of disciples. Not hopefully someday disciples, but maybe not because we can't say for sure. Disciples. Followers of Jesus. Now, that wouldn't be the main reason I don't believe baptizing babies is right or at all helpful. It'd just be a little side dish along with several other clearer reasons from the Bible. So, if I wanted to make that point, I could, but I don't have time, so I'm not going to. So, forget I ever said that. Two further observations about baptizing as the beginning of making disciples. First of all, I want you to notice this command to make disciples baptizing situates the Great Commission into the local church. The local church, which Jesus introduced earlier in the same gospel, Matthew 16, Matthew 18, isn't mentioned here. It's very much in the background, but when Jesus tells his followers to baptize, well, that sets us firmly. That locates us in a local church setting. After all, the rest of the Bible makes so clear baptism is a church ordinance given to the church and given to churches. So, in Acts 2, when Jesus' followers receive the promised Holy Spirit who comes in power and who blesses the preaching and thousands repent and believe, the first thing they do is to baptize them. They're just obeying Jesus' command. They believe. Wonderful. Let's baptize them. And then Acts says, as many as were baptized were added to our number. Whose number? Freshly formed church at Jerusalem's number. The baptized were numbered among them. They were numbered among the church. And so, the pattern continues throughout Acts and throughout church history. You don't have the authority to baptize, and neither do I, on my own. That's why you don't baptize your friend in a creek because you're a Christian, even if you led them to believe in Christ. Jesus hasn't authorized you to do that. That's why I don't invite you over to my house to baptize you in my girl's kiddie pool in our backyard. Jesus hasn't either authorized me to do that, even as a pastor. Jesus has authorized the church together to baptize. We do this together as a local church. We have together the keys of the kingdom, Matthew 16 and Matthew 18, and we'll turn them together in just a few moments in our service. There's a people, in other words, into which you are baptized. You now belong to them, and they to you. Second thing I want you to notice on this instruction to baptize, I want you to notice that there's also a name into which you are baptized. Did you catch that? Baptizing them, Jesus says, in or into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Baptize them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. This is a Trinitarian formula. If you're here this morning, maybe you didn't know, Christians believe that God is one, and yet the one God exists eternally in three different persons. I know that's so mind-bending and confusing, but we believe that, and we confess that with Christians across the ages because of verses like this. Do you notice that there's one name here? Jesus takes his own name, first of all, and places it right alongside God the Father's, and then places the Spirit right alongside himself and the Father, and notice there are three mentioned, but they share one name, which is called the name. Three sharing one name. One name, three persons. One essence, three persons. One God, three persons. Baptism is putting on the name of God. It's identifying as now his. Baptizing into the name is a military image. It's initiation. It's pledging allegiance to a commander. Baptizing into the name has military overtones, as in enlisting yourself into and under the command of a general, namely King Jesus. We often lose this in our culture because we don't think of names and identity in quite the same way that the original audience of the Bible did. Actually, Islamic communities understand that those in their midst who are, say, encountered by Christians, and they come across Christians, they can read the Bible. They can meet with Christians. They can do many other Christian things that might be frowned upon or dangerous, but it's only at baptism where the Islamic community understands that the individual has now left Allah and is now following Jesus. Isn't that interesting? It's baptism that is the point of no return, as Islam understands it. It's at baptism, one missionary author says, that the persecution then soars against the Christians. I think Muslims, in this way, are perhaps ironically seeing something about baptism that we Christians often forget. Again, I bet we get more questions about baptism than any other subject in our five-year history as a church. I want to be clear. I'm very glad for these questions. Please keep them coming. We're all working this stuff out with our Bibles open, so I'm not shaming anybody for asking the question. But it's more and more common, and I think part of the reason for so many questions, more and more common to hear people who are just confused, if not offended, by our requirement of baptism. And I just want to point out something all too obvious. It's not our requirement. It is Jesus' requirement for all of His followers. Let me give you a fun homework assignment for you to do this week and then get back to me on next week. Search your entire New Testament and find every single follower of Jesus you can who's not been baptized. I'll give you a spoiler. You're not going to find one. And don't talk to me about the thief on the cross. If you are hanging next to Jesus and and you're about to die and that's the only chance, then fine, we can talk about not being baptized. You're not going to find one. Somebody close to me recently called me. They were out of town and visiting a church, and they called to tell me of their experience because it was just so strange to them and they wanted to process it with me. So they were in the service and the lights were out because obviously the Holy Ghost is shy and more apt to show up if no one can see Him. And so the lights were out, except of course on the stage. Big lights and big noise from the stage. And then off to the side, my friend who called me noticed during the end of the service, while everything was blaring from the stage, they noticed some faint noises and commotion off to the side. And they looked and saw dark silhouettes of bodies and sort of, you know, blinked and double-blinked as one does when it was dark outside. And after blinking a few times, they realized that these people were taking the Lord's Supper together. Nobody said anything. No instructions were given. Evidently, the people who went there regularly just knew that you could go take it if you wanted to. Optional, side option in the life of the church. I share that story not to pat ourselves on the back or put some other church on blast. I share that story because I think that image perfectly captures how we as Christians today, at least in the West, often think about the ordinances, often think about baptism and the Lord's Supper, namely as private, optional side items to the Christian life. Totally fine. Nobody's like against them. Maybe even a good thing if you're, you know, if you're wanting a little spiritual boost in your life, but at the end of the day, kind of optional. So we ask Christians today, what's the bare minimum to be saved and enter heaven? That's an important question. How would you answer that question? The answer we answer, faith alone in Christ alone. Yes. Amen. Don't say anything else. Anything else you add to faith alone in Christ alone, you spoiled the gospel. Yeah. The thief on the cross was never baptized and he was the first, at least among the first, to see Jesus in paradise. But my Christian friends, I want to warn you of a doctrinal minimalism, which is so characteristic of our age and of the church of our age, and which may be characteristic of you. And if it is, well, it's something to repent of and move a million miles away from. In no other sphere of life would we operate like this and think it's all right. Imagine if a husband thought, okay, what's the bare minimum I have to do for my wife not to leave me? Don't cheat on her. All right. That's all I'm doing. What? Does that sound like a healthy marriage? Why do we bring that attitude and posture into the Christian life? Jesus has given us these commands. If you're here and a follower of Jesus and you've not made your faith public by being baptized, friend, we'd love to talk with you about that, about your coming to the waters and obeying Jesus. Jesus is Lord, Jesus is Savior, and He's King. We glory that He requires nothing of us, nothing from us, no work from us, only trust, only receive. And we glory so much in Him that it's our joy then to ask, now what does He want of me? Which is right where the Great Commission ends. And so we'll look finally at the third thing Jesus tells us, tells all churches to do as we go to all nations, which is to mature disciples. Verse 20 begins, teaching them, He finishes this radical mission, this Great Commission, this Great Command with teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. This is, I don't know if you caught this reading, this is one of the most awkward verse breaks in all the Bible. Those aren't from God, by the way, the chapters and little numbers, those are some scribe trying to help. It's wonderfully helpful, but I have no idea why they broke the verse here in the middle of the sentence. But actually, imagine if the Great Commission did actually end with verse 19 in your translation. What would we have then? We'd have a command, we'd have a mission to go, go to all the nations, make disciples, and baptize them, period. Now that's pretty good, but if that's all we had, you could be forgiven for thinking that making disciples simply means, again, making converts. So get them saved, get them dunked, and then on to the next one. In spite of that weird verse break, the mission doesn't end with verse 19. The command of Jesus reaches still further and binds us all, teaching them, He says, to observe all that I have commanded you. Teaching them, He says, to observe all that I have commanded you. The Great Commission, to be obeyed, requires teaching them, teaching everyone, to observe what? All. All that I have commanded you. Now, how long does that take? Has anyone out there done it and timed it? And could report back to us how long it took to obey all that Jesus has commanded of you, of us, of all of us? This, my friends, is the rest of your life, the rest of my life, all of life, under the Lordship of Christ, until death, until glory. That's discipleship. All things. And not just know all things, He says. Oh, how nice would it be if it just said, teach them, teach them all things, and that's it. Oh, how nice that would be. So church just becomes a school, and he who learns the most Bible, and memorizes the most verses, and knows the most theology, is by far the best Christian, and can retire at an early age. But no, it says not just teach them, it says teach them to observe, to obey. To my smart friends in the room, some of you are much smarter than me, you have no leg up on the rest of us on this one. You, like me, like us all, must not merely know, you must obey. That's the true and truest test of a disciple. He learns, he obeys. She learns, she obeys. I preached somewhat recently for another friend, and it was a dominantly white church, but there was a few immigrants in the crowd who I noticed who were not white. And I met one of the immigrant women after the service, and I asked her how long she'd come to this church, and how she came to this church. I knew the city, had a massive immigrant community to which she belonged, and so it was just fascinating to me that she came to this dominantly white church. And so I asked her how she got there, and she said, with a smile on her face, she said she came, and it was strange at first, coming to this sea of white people. But then she said, here they teach the Bible. That's why I go here. God bless that woman, we should all learn from her. You want to obey Jesus? Go, you go, I go, where they teach his word and teach all of his word. I don't care if it's a white church, a black church, an immigrant community church. I'd go to a church where I didn't speak the language, and I had to receive translations from somebody if they taught the word before I go to somewhere else who shortchanged me. Go to somewhere where they'll preach Leviticus. You learn it all, and you eat it up, is what disciples do. And yet, teaching is aimed at obedience. Again, learning isn't enough. Actually, that's not quite right. Just knowing more and more, but not obeying, that's not really learning in the truest sense, is it? That's not discipleship. That's what I call eggheadery. And I learned that and coined that term. I don't know if I coined it. It's what I use. I don't know who else uses it. I learned that in my own life when I was, I don't know, 24, 25, 26, devouring everything I could on the Bible and all the books and all the theology I could. And at some point, you wake up, and you realize, man, this isn't a race, but if it were, my head is running laps around my heart and my hands. And if you ever feel like that, God, help us to obey it, not just know it, but live it. Obey all that I have commanded you, Jesus says. Obey all that I have commanded you. Where are you presently disobeying Jesus' commands? Or maybe you're not outright disobeying. Where are you not yet fully obeying Jesus? Good question for us all to ask. And that brings us back where we all started with this first command to make disciples. It's a radical mission, great commission. If I could conclude with a thought experiment, a thought experiment for you all, for us all, I want you to imagine, what if those first churches, those first 11 and then the churches they formed, what if those first churches and the hundreds and thousands and the centuries that followed, what if they disobeyed this command? What if the first Christians never left Jerusalem, taking the gospel with them? What if Paul never made it to Rome to preach the gospel to the ends of the earth? What if those earliest Christians chose their own comfort over obedience to Jesus' command? What if the gospel never spread across all of Europe? What if Christians never sailed for America? And yeah, they sailed here for all kinds of mixed reasons and mixed motives, but in part, rest assured, they sailed here, the Christians at least, to bring and to spread the gospel to the new world. And what if they never had? So many of you, I know, were taught the sacred scriptures from childhood. What if the gospel never got to your mom or your dad and you didn't grow up in that home? What if you grew up in a home where there were no Bibles for you to read? So many more of you are the first Christians ever in your family. What if the gospel never made it to your friend or your neighbor or your co-workers? And what if that friend or that neighbor had never spoken up, had never risked making things awkward, and never risked the friendship to tell you about Jesus? Friends, we're here this morning, all of us, because generations of disciples before us made their lives about getting the gospel to us. This does not even exist. We don't exist. This is not happening today if not for the labors of Christians we've never met who obeyed Jesus. What an amazing thought. One more final thought experiment. What will happen if we don't obey this command as a church? I don't think it's really that complicated, and I want to be clear what I'm about to say is not, and what I'm about to do is not at all prophecy. It's just obviously true, and it happens all the time. Let me tell you what will happen if we don't, as a church, obey this command, the Great Commission. Well, the church will reach a point where it slowly starts to die, but nobody will notice it at first, but there'll be little signs that nobody pays attention to. There'll be more fighting, and we'll fight about anything and everything among each other, and lose sight of anybody and everybody outside of these walls, and everything will slowly become about our past, which matters, of course, but the church will entirely be about memorials of what God did among us long ago, years ago, maybe while our parents were here. Pastors will be, over time, eventually, if we live long enough, pastors will be run off, and prayer meetings will be sparsely attended, and prayers will reach no further than our own sicknesses, and our own ailments, and our own discomforts, and nothing else, nothing outside these walls, even these bodies. We'll miss all these signs, and we'll tell ourselves it's all fine, maybe even tell ourselves, actually, we're the way we are. Things are declining because we're declining because we're doing it right, and all the other churches are doing it wrong. It's amazing, the things we tell ourselves. Or we'll think that we're still good and fine because we have money saved in the bank. Do you know how many dead corpse churches are out there just coasting along, and feeling fine, and not seeking help because they pay their bills, and have plenty left to spare? We'll eventually forget what a disciple is, and eventually confuse the gospel. It'll become a strange and offensive thing to ask, or to be asked, one of any of us, do you follow Jesus? Or when did you first start following Jesus? What do you mean? I've always followed Jesus, of course. Now it's over, and the lamp stand is removed. Of course, we hope for better things. I hope for better things. I don't want to end five-year celebration. And our hope is right, not because of ourselves, or because of our pastors, or even you, but because we know the promises of God. Revelation 7 tells us the end of the history ends like this. After this, I looked, and behold, John says, a great multitude that no one could number from every nation, from all tribes, and peoples, and languages. All those nations standing before the throne, and before the lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands, and crying out with a loud voice, salvation belongs to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the lamb. Imagine that chorus singing that song of gospel praise in every single tongue, from every tribe, every nation, every color, every everything. That's happening. That is sure. Our hope is sure. The great commission will be fulfilled. Jesus will get his reward from every tribe, and every tongue, and every nation. There's zero question about that. The only question is, will we obey? And may God help us to obey together for the next 50 years.
