Dear Pat, so sorry for not having written before, I do hope you're very well. We have survived yet another glorious English winter, I wonder which day summer falls on this year. Oh, but my dear, I have been so busy since Christmas, beside working at school. You know I was keen on Chuck Berry and I thought I was the only fan for miles and miles, but one morning at Dartford Station, I was holding one of Chuck's records when a guy I knew from primary school, seven to 11 years ago, you know, came up to me. He's got every record Chuck Berry ever made and all his mates have too. They're all rhythm and blues fans, real R&B, I mean, none of this other, I won't use that language, marvelous. Anyways, the guy at the station, he's called Mick Jagger and all the chicks and all the boys meet every Saturday morning in some juke joint called the Carousel. So one morning in January, I was walking past and decided to look him up and Mick is the greatest R&B singer this side of the Atlantic, and I don't mean maybe, well, I can't think of anything else to bore you with, so I'll sign off. Good night, viewers. Big grin, Keith, XXXXX, end quote. That's Keith Richards, 18 years old, writing to his Aunt Patty, describing a chance meeting with a boy named Mick who came up to him on a train in London, on a random train in London, seeing that he was holding records of a musician that they both happened to really like and didn't think anybody else really liked, striking up a conversation, realizing they'd actually been friends years before as seven and eight-year-olds. Before the other boy's family moved away, changing schools, they hit it off, the two now 18-year-olds, they started playing music together, they formed a band called the Rolling Stones and the rest is history, and it all started with two elementary classmates bumping into each other, surprisingly, randomly, by chance on a crowded London train, chance. What a fascinating idea, chances. It conveys the gap between our knowledge or maybe even our intentions and our realities, what actually happens to us. The gap between, another way of saying it, between what we mean to happen or what we can control and what actually happens, chance. Things which happen without our knowing or intending them to happen, random things, accidents, all related ideas, chance. Sometimes we speak of chance as something bigger, as an impersonal force, really the impersonal force ruling our lives, so we speak of chance basically like it's fate. How much of world history, rock and roll or world wars is altered and shaped by chance, by chance, random, unexpected meetings in your life? How much of your life is, isn't most of your life just following according to chance? Do you believe in chance? Turning to Ruth 2 this morning, if you have your Bible, Naomi, if you weren't here last week, last week we covered Ruth 1, Naomi is now empty and bitter. She's buried her husband and her only two children, two sons, Malon and Kilion. She's empty, she's bitter. All she has with her now and left to her possession is Ruth, her formerly pagan, Gentile, Moabite daughter-in-law who somehow and for some reason against all odds decided to stick with her and now they've made it back home to Bethlehem, Naomi's hometown. As we pick up in Ruth chapter 2 and once again, this chapter this morning is divided like last week into three different scenes which you can easily see just by reading over and even skimming the verses from this chapter. The first scene is morning or maybe breakfast at Naomi's in verses 1 and 2. The second scene, the longest scene is a day, Ruth, a day out in the fields working, verses 3 through 17. And then the final scene is back home evening time now at Naomi's in verses 18 through 23. So if you're trying to follow along, take notes, see where I'm going, where I am in the passage, those are the three scenes, those are the three points of my sermon. First, morning at Naomi's, second, a day out in the fields, third, evening at Naomi's. So let's begin by looking together at this first scene taking place perhaps at the breakfast table of Naomi beginning in verse 1. Chapter 2 begins in the verse of the narrator. Notice this. Verse 1 opens up in the voice of the narrator. Verses 2 and 3 are going to dive into a dialogue happening between Ruth and Naomi and then further dive into the scene and setting the scene here. But verse 1 begins, first of all, with a critical comment from the narrator. It says this. Now, Naomi had a relative of her husband's, a worthy man of the clan of Elimelech, whose name was Boaz. Now we're going to meet Boaz and we're going to learn all those things and much more in just a few moments in this very chapter. And yet the author says it anyways because this is the author's way of framing for you, for me, how we're to view this story. He's telling you what he wants you to look for and who he really wants you to stare at, Boaz, this worthy man from the clan of Elimelech. All of that matters, all these details and so many more about Boaz as we'll soon come to see. Ruth and Naomi are back in Bethlehem now and they're back among Naomi's people 10 years or more later. So a new beginning, a fresh start for Naomi and for Ruth as well. But if you're thinking this is already just tragedy turned to triumph, then think again. It's good to be home, no doubt, but they have nothing, Ruth and Naomi. They have no job. They have no money. They have no surviving family to take care for them. They are utterly bereft. Evidently, they found shelter. We don't know where, but surely something minimal, just enough to survive. And they're surely racing the clock. Whatever arrangements they've made for room and board, surely it's only temporary and they've got to figure out a way quickly to make a life beginning with some food. And so Ruth wakes up one morning, I don't know if this is the day after they arrived or months later, we don't know. But she wakes up one morning and she proposes to Naomi, her mother-in-law, a plan. Look at verse 2. And Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, let me go to the field and glean among the ears of grain after him and whose sight I shall find favor. I don't know how many of you have ever fallen on hard economic times where you genuinely didn't know how you were going to make ends meet. So many of us have never experienced that in life. But how quickly in that situation you get way over your head. Easy there. How quickly in desperation, one poor decision leads to a dozen more poor decisions. How quickly, for instance, debt leads to more debt and further debt. And before you know it, you're drowning. I have a few sisters in the room this morning, not to pick on you, but if you fall or fell on hard times, God forbid, if you lost your job, if you suddenly became a widow or life just in some way or another smacks you, think of what recourses you would take. Maybe you've thought of this before. What would you do if all of a sudden everything you depended on, counted on, relied upon for life or sustenance, if it was just ripped away, what would you do, ladies? You could call on family, perhaps, to take you in or help you out. Naomi's family has all died off and Ruth left hers far behind. You could apply for, sisters, a new job and you could even, even if you're a little bit older, you could still train yourself for a new career. You could pull yourself up by your own bootstraps. That's because you're a woman in the United States in 2023. There are no such opportunities for Ruth and Naomi in this agrarian, farmers, crops, and very much patriarchal society. If it came down to it, you could seek assistance from the government. There's no welfare system for Ruth and Naomi. Ruth and Naomi, I'm trying to show you, are incredibly vulnerable right now and really an endangered species. They have one shot and it's far from a sure one, but it is a shot. You see, God had enshrined into Israel's laws a certain provision for the poor. You can see this in a number of places. I'm not going to ask you to turn there, but Leviticus 23-22, just for instance, this is a law, one of several repetitions of such a law, which God gave to Israel. Leviticus 23-22, and when you reap the harvest of your land, God says, you shall not reap your field right up to its edge, nor shall you gather the gleanings after your harvest. You shall leave them for the poor and for the sojourner. I am the Lord your God. That law is repeated, or something like that is repeated multiple times. Basically, leave the edges of your field, of your produce, basically your leftovers, leave them for the poor and for the stranger. If I could just invite you to ponder that law and what that law says to us about God. The Bible was written in large part that we might meet, all these books, history, prophecy, all these books are written that we might meet and get to know, as it were, the God of the universe. What a thought. What's he like? This is scary, by the way. If you don't like him, what can you do about it? Nothing. You can walk away from him, but you can't change who he is. He is what he is. What if he's revealed in here just to be a tyrant? Just an irrational, selfish tyrant. What can you do about the matter? What can I do about it? The God we meet in the Bible enshrines laws for the wealthy, for landowners, to care for the poor and for outsiders. That's what he's like. His eye is on the sparrow. The God of the Bible is the father to the fatherless, shelter to the widow, embrace to the outsider. Deuteronomy 10, 17 through 19. For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God who is not partial and who takes no bribe. He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and he loves the sojourner, giving him food and clothing. Love the sojourner, therefore, for you are sojourners in the land of Egypt. This is what God is like. This is the heart of God. It's the same heart that ultimately concocts the plan which concludes in Calvary with a cross. It's the same heart which, which kills the son, God himself, having taken on flesh for your sins, for my sins, then rising him from the dead to accomplish victory and salvation for undeserving sinners like us. This is the heart of God. If only the outsider, the unbelieving world knew that this is what God is like. I hope you know this is what he's like. The kindness of God gives Ruth and Naomi a hope and a prayer. It gives them a chance, at least a shot at survival. There's nothing glamorous about this chance they've been given. Maybe a modern day comparison for this gleaning would be something like the destitute who collect cans each day in cities and trade them into a recycling center for small profits. I looked it up in Virginia. A pound of cans is worth 33 cents. Do you know how many cans you'd have to, day after day after day, how many pounds? Just to eke out some kind of semblance of an existence or maybe, maybe dumpster diving, looking for something of at least minimal value that you could sell or trade in. There's nothing glamorous about this whatsoever, but you could eke out an existence and who knows, with a hope and a prayer, maybe something more. It's also far from sure, this plan of Ruth and then affirmed by Naomi. You have to remember, remember last week, these are the days of the judges. Do you remember? Who's keeping that law in these days anyways? Is anybody? Worse than that, throughout the book of Judges, just before Ruth, the same time period as Ruth and Naomi are living in Bethlehem, Israel had a reputation, I showed you last week, for brutalizing women, taking advantage of and assaulting the marginalized. Ruth is a young woman from a hated enemy nation, Moab. Did you notice, as Scott was reading, how many times Ruth, the Moabite, she was from Moab, is repeated? It's so redundant, but it's just all driving home the point. She is a foreigner. She is an outsider. She is an enemy. What do you think is going to happen when a woman from Moab goes out into the fields in the land of Israel in the days of the judges? Ruth's plan isn't great at all. It's an incredibly dangerous plan. None of you, none of us would send our daughters gleaning in this day. This plan isn't that great, but in desperation, it's the best they've got. And it depends, I want you to notice, it depends entirely upon Ruth finding grace. Look at verse 2. You can see Ruth's hope and prayer is to glean after someone, quote, in whose sight I shall find favor. That word favor there is the same word for grace. Her entire plan depends upon grace. She banks her entire life and all of her hopes upon grace. What kind of plan is this? Maybe not such a terrible one after all. And Naomi, whether due to her own despondency or her own awareness of their desperate station, Naomi has no other ideas. Naomi approves, and she said to Ruth, go, my daughter. And so the second scene shifts to a day at work, a day out in the fields, beginning in verse 3, where we read that Ruth set out and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers. So on the edge of Bethlehem and cities in Israel, like Bethlehem, on the edge of the city, on the outskirts, there were large fields, which were then sectioned off and divided among different men, the worthy men, the men of stature, the land owners in Bethlehem or whatever city. They owned different portions of those fields. And now, after years of famine, remember, there's finally a harvest. So Ruth, the young Moabite woman, total outsider, total stranger to this town and to all these people, she makes her way out into these fields, surely just hoping to go unnoticed. Imagine Ruth approaching the people of the town and the workers of these fields. She probably looks differently. Just imagine what that scene would have looked like. Imagine what she would have felt. Where do you feel like in your life? Do you ever feel like an outsider? Where and when in your life do you— we all feel like outsiders at some points in some places. Where do you in your life feel like an outsider? Ever walked into a room and felt kind of sideways glances and maybe observed a few whispers, and they're clearly talking about you. You ever felt like an outsider? Maybe when you traveled to a foreign country where you didn't speak the language, didn't look like the people. Maybe at your in-law's house. I'm sorry if that's true for you. That's sad. Maybe it's among the wealthy. Some people just feel utterly out of place among the wealthy or the uber-wealthy. Maybe it's among the blue-collar. I never personally feel more like an outsider and more intimidated than when I go to the car mechanic shop. Because I feel like all of those people are geniuses at what they do, and I am not, and I feel like they immediately know that, and I'm the easiest prey in the world. Maybe it's in church. Can you remember what it was like the first time you walked into church? Or maybe you returned to church. Or maybe tried a new church. Ruth is a total outsider here, only the stakes for her are far higher than a little awkwardness or maybe embarrassment or discomfort. Her life is on the line out in these fields, in the land of Israel, in the days of the judges. And so we read in verse 3, She set out, and she went, and she gleaned in the field after the reapers, and she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the clan of Elimelech. And behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem. Ah, it's that man. It's that man from verse 1, the worthy man, the probably tall, dark, and the handsome man. Verse 1, it's Boaz. I want you to see it. The author throws everything he's got at you. Behold, Boaz, Boaz. You already told you about him. Now Boaz from Bethlehem, look at this guy. Look at Boaz. Look at Boaz. And so what I want to do together now is I want us to take a good long look at Boaz and put together just from these, this scene and these verses, this chapter, a bit of a biography or a resume for Boaz, the worthy man of the clan of Elimelech. Observe with me all the different things we learn about him in just these few verses. Let's stare at this man together. First, notice he's a worthy man, verse 1 says. He's a worthy man. That can mean, that phrase, a worthy man, depending upon context, that can mean either that he's a man of significant means or wealth or that he's a man of high moral standing. The Bible uses that phrase in both senses and it's up to context to determine whether the author is saying, hey, he's rich or hey, we might say, he's a man of integrity. It doesn't really matter in this instance which the author means because as we read the rest of the scene in the story and we meet more of Boaz's character, he's clearly both. He's clearly a man of means. He owns, he operates this land. That put him in the elite in Bethlehem. He's also very clearly a man of character, a man of upstanding nature and integrity. Notice as well, he's a man from Bethlehem and even of the clan of Elimelech, verses 3 and 4 tell us. Now in verse 1, again, the narrator already told us he was a relative of Elimelech. Remember Elimelech is Naomi's deceased husband. Verse 3 repeats the point. He's of the clan of Elimelech. A clan is somewhere between immediate family and your tribe. So think about your family. I grew up, any of you grew up going to family reunions? Ooh, baby. No? Southern, maybe a Southern thing. And nobody went to family reunions growing up? Are you serious? South, yes. Praise God. So, you know, you've got your family. I have parents, you have parents. I have brothers. I have first cousins. I have aunts and uncles. I know all these people, but then I go to my family reunion and I'll meet all these other cousins and I've never met them before and they look different, talk different, but a lot of them have my same last name and I meet all these second aunts and great, great uncles. Second aunts, is that a thing? That's not a thing. Great aunts. Great, great aunts. Great, great uncles. I meet all these people, my family. That's who Boaz is to Naomi. Probably not a man she was very familiar with, had spent much time with her, perhaps didn't even know, but she might have seen him at a family reunion. Wait, we've shared fried chicken together in Macclesfield, North Carolina at the First Christian Church with all the other Feltons. That's Boaz. Next, notice, also, it's important, Ruth does not know any of this. You know this because the narrator keeps giving you little clues. Ruth knows none of this. She has no idea who this guy is or where he comes from. This is all massive, as we'll see especially next week. Next, notice, he's an older man. You can see this actually throughout the chapter. In verse five, Boaz refers to Ruth as this young woman. In verse eight, he addresses Ruth as my daughter. That's the same phrase that Naomi uses when she addresses Ruth, which probably places Elimelech in or around the same generation as, or not Elimelech, Boaz in the same or around the same generation as Naomi, maybe roughly one generation above Ruth. There's nothing romantic or even patronizing about this language. It's kind, it's respectful, it's tender. In the next chapter, to go ahead, Boaz marvels that Ruth hasn't gone after, quote, younger men. So he's surely an older man. Next, notice, he's a man of faith. Look at verse four, his first words spoken in the story. He said to the reapers, the Lord be with you. And they answered back to him, the Lord bless you. What? In the days of the judges? This was not a greeting that was happening in and around Israel in those dark days. But even in the days of the judges, the darkest days of Israel, the days of apostasy, of idolatry, of brutality. But evidently not everyone. Some still believe, some still share the same faith of Father Abraham. At least one did in Boaz. Reminds me a little bit of the fiery prophet Elijah who believed he was the only one in all Israel who still hadn't bowed down to Baal and God then steadily reveals to him that God has 7,000 more in the land who are still faithful. You have no idea. God always has his remnant. Even in the darkest of days, God always has a Boaz. He's a man, notice, of inquiry. Hard word for me to say being from the South. He's a man of inquiry. In verse five, look at how he asked his foreman, whose young woman is this? He doesn't know. He doesn't recognize her. But he's curious. When he finds out who she is, she's that moabite the town's been talking about who's stuck by Ruth's, by Naomi's side. When he finds that out, notice how he immediately shows her favor. And when he's asked for an explanation from Ruth, why are you being so kind to me? Look at verse 11. Boaz answered her, all that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband has been fully told to me and how you left your father and mother and your native land and came to a people that you did not know before. May the Lord repay you for what you have done. Notice he's been paying attention. He's been studying his surroundings. He's been studying and making note of the people and the stories who God was bringing into Bethlehem. By the way, young men and women in the room, notice that he's drawn to this woman by her character, not by her appearance. That's reading something into the text that is not there. He's drawn to her first by her character. I remember when I first showed up to college. I went to eat in the dining hall, freshman year in the dormitory I stayed in, I lived in, they had a dining hall. And so I go into the dining hall and this man walks up to me and I immediately recognize him. Number one, because he was a man in leadership on a campus ministry and I'd seen and heard of him because I knew people in leadership ministry. Number two, he had one arm, he was missing an arm from the time he was a small child as I'd come to find out the story and all that behind. So I immediately recognized the man but I'd never met him, I'd never said a word to him and he walked up to me and he said, hey, Matt, I'm Todd, nice to meet you. I said, hey, I'm Matt. He said, I know, I just introduced, I said, hey, Matt, never met the guy before. He said, I know, I've been wanting to meet you and get to know you. And I thought, maybe it was a little creepy but also he was, he was paying attention to what God was doing and who God was bringing around. He was surveying his surroundings and studying how he could serve those and be influential upon those that God was moving around him. We could all use a bit more curiosity in our lives like that, could we not? If I could just speak directly to those of you who are younger in the room, I would encourage you to be more curious about those, especially those saints in your church who are ahead of you and who are older than you. There are actual people that you've seen, maybe you know their name but you've probably never sat down with who were alive when Elvis was alive. Who were alive when there was no internet. They lived without it. Who've also, perhaps, followed Jesus for decades longer than you or I have. We would all do well to just sit down and be more curious and inquire about the people and the stories around us and study what God is doing. Boaz is a very curious man. He's also, next notice, he's a man of humility. A man of humility. I take this from the way he walks among and then greets the reapers. I take this from the meal that Boaz shares with the reapers of this field beginning in verse 14 and you get the impression reading this that this was nothing unusual. This was a regular occurrence for him. You gotta, these are his servant's servants. He speaks to his foreman here, the leader of them. That guy's closest, that guy's way beneath Boaz but he's closest in the chain. These reapers, these gleaners, they're nobodies. They're immigrants picking up the leftovers at the edges of his field and he blesses them in God's name. He speaks to them with kindness. He also dines with them. Could that be said of you? Romans 12 verse 16 Paul writes to the Roman Christians and to all Christians. He says, do not be haughty but associate with the lowly. Those are among the closing words in the greatest letter ever written in the history of the world. My Bible, this isn't inspired, but my Bible designates that section where those words come as marks of a genuine Christian. Associate with the lowly. Could that be said of you? Eager, happy to associate with the lowly, treats them as equals, enjoys their company, those who you can literally receive nothing back from. Could that be said of you? Boaz is a man of remarkable humility. He's a man next of protection. Verse 8 Then Boaz, learning who Ruth is, he says to Ruth, now listen my daughter, do not go to glean in another field or leave this one, but keep close to my young women. Let, those are other young women who are servants, regular gleaners, reapers in his field. Let your eyes be on the field that they are reaping and go after them. Have, watch this, have I not charged the young men not to touch you? I want you to notice in this passage there are multiple reminders. I'm not just speculating or being dramatic when I talk about these days of the judges. On the lips of both Boaz and Naomi are words about Ruth's safety among these dangerous people in this land. Have I not charged these young men not to touch you? Again these are brutal days especially for women. Do you see what Boaz is doing? You stay here, you keep close to my other young women who are also reaping, they are under my protection, if you stay near them you will be too. He's a man of protection. Finally notice he's a man of provision. Verse 14 and at mealtime we read Boaz said to Ruth, come here and eat some bread and dip your morsel in the wine. So she sat beside the reapers and he passed to her roasted grain and she ate until she was satisfied and she had some left over. When she rose to glean Boaz instructed his young men saying, let her glean even among the sheaves and do not, this is an even better crop, and do not reproach her and also pull out some of the bundles for her and leave it for her to make it easy for her. Do not rebuke her. So she gleaned in the field until evening then she beat out what she had gleaned and it was about an ephah of barley. I know we don't I know we don't know what an ephah is. I had to look it up. It's 30 pounds of grain. They take a break for a meal all morning gleaning beneath the scorching sun. It's time for food. He calls Ruth near he fills her with food. You know it's a thing in our culture women go on first dates it's just it's a comment they don't eat. Not Ruth food is everywhere she is very full she's been hungry and she just young ladies it's in God's word. At evening then again he cares for her so generously that she goes home with 30 pounds of barley. Picture picture little Ruth stumbling home looking for Naomi with a big old smile and laughter because of what she's carrying on. Naomi you're not going to believe this. Behold Boaz. Boaz. That's the man who whose field Ruth stumbled upon. The first field she came to was his. Even more that's the man who happened to pop by when seemingly right as Ruth arrived so that Ruth actually met him in person. How did this happen? How could she be so fortunate look at verse 3. I want to read it for you again I want you to stare at what the author says here. So she set out and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers and she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz who was of the clan of Elimelech. I want you to stare and I want you to ponder and I want you to appreciate the word happened. The original literally it could be translated as by chance this would be a more literal translation by chance she chanced upon the part of the field belonging to Boaz who was of the clan of Elimelech. We might say by sheer dumb luck she came to Boaz's part of the field the worthy man who was a relative of Naomi you can read this happen you can read this in one of two ways first of all you can read it straightforwardly woodenly so the author is just telling you that it really was just sheer dumb luck it really was random wow coincidence how lucky chance or you can read it as I think you're meant to read it as written by an author with a smile on his face and a wink in his eye as he tells you the story nothing but a hope and a prayer and a Hail Mary plan and no idea what she was doing or what she was up against risking her life just by going out on her own into these fields in these days of the judges and somehow stumbling upon the fields of this man who just happened to be a worthy man who just happened to be a relative of her mother-in-law who just happened to be a faithful servant of God in the dark days of the judges. When Abraham sent his servant to find a wife for Isaac his son and there at the well appears Rebecca tada happened which do you think the author of Ruth is communicating? Can you believe Ruth just happened upon this field sheer dumb luck or the kind providence of the good God who ever rules behind the scenes and in the shadows to show favor to his people all with a smile on his face? Ruth for herself seems to begin to at least grasp just what's going on and maybe just what this God is like who she's left all she knew for everything she's known behind for this God look at verse 10 we read she fell on her face bowing to the ground and she said to Boaz why have I found favor in your eyes grace that you should take notice of me since I am a foreigner and Boaz answered her all that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband has been fully told me and how you left your father and mother in your native land and came to a people that you did not know before the Lord repay you for what you have done and a full reward be given to you by the Lord the God of Israel under whose wings you have come to take refuge then she said I have found favor favor grace in your eyes for you have comforted me and spoken kindly to your servant though I am not even one of your servants think about it Ruth set out to glean in the fields in the town of Bethlehem in the land of Israel in the days of the judges just hoping to find favor verse 2 grace that's her only shot twice she repeats verse 10 and then verse 13 I have found seemingly moments later I have found favor in your eyes grace I found it she said that was all I that was my only shot and I walked right into it grace favor she reminds me here as she's learning like every Christian is learning what it means to live a life under grace aren't you learning that if you're a Christian here this morning a life dependent upon grace learning in our lives to dance if I could put it like this to the rhythms of God's grace she's learning and she reminds me here of the Virgin Mary another young woman who also encountered great even overwhelming favor as we read earlier in the service grace from God and we read in the gospels that she stored up Mary did all these things in her heart she wondered she pondered she treasured grace so Ruth here and I wonder about you do you see the hand of God in the random chance events of your life chance do you see God's hand in it all consider quietly or for the rest of your day out loud consider where you've been consider who you've met ponder how chance has redirected and shaped the course of your life do you see God's hand in your life do you see how he's brought you here to where you are today Ruth the book of Ruth along with the rest of the Old Testament is written in Hebrew the Hebrew language is a fascinating language most obviously in that it's written right to left so unlike English or even Greek the New Testament which we read left to right Hebrew characters in Hebrew words are left so to us to read Hebrew you actually have to read what to us feels like reading backwards John Flavel the first Puritan I ever read we actually have the first book I ever read now on the book stall thanks to our deaconess of book stall John Flavel famously noted that God's providences that is his superintendence his ruling over all the affairs of the world and even your life he said like Hebrew characters can only be read backwards in other words oh how nice it would be to read them forward all of you young people what do you want to know what's God's will for my life what's my career supposed to be what's my job going to be where am I going to move who's my spouse going to be wouldn't that be so nice oh how we would love that doesn't work later at the end after the fact backwards like Hebrew we can only learn what God was doing at least in part after it's done we can only see then whatever triumphs and joys and wins whatever pain and trials and sufferings and losses we can only see then in part what God was doing and perhaps even why and how all of it even the parts covered in tears all of it was grace that brings us finally and just briefly to the final scene as Ruth arrives back home and we get a little glimpse into evening at Naomi's place look at verse 18 she took it up she took that ephah of barley and she went into the city her mother-in-law Naomi saw what she had gleaned she also brought out and gave her what food she had left over after being satisfied and her mother-in-law said to her where did you glean today and where have you worked blessed be the man who took notice of you you can feel can you not feel the anticipation here the big reveal which is coming Naomi had to have been watching out the and here she sees Ruth waltzing in or maybe stumbling in with all this food on her back enough food to last her a few weeks what who did this what did you do Ruth blessed is this man what is his name by the way please tell me his name Ruth so she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked oh they still won't tell you he's tinkering with you right now so she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked today is Boaz and Naomi Boaz and Naomi said to her daughter-in-law may he be blessed by the Lord whose kindness has not forsaken the living and the dead Naomi also said to Ruth this man she knows the name this man is a close relative of ours he's one of our Redeemers you have to wait until next week to hear more so Naomi and Ruth the Moabite said besides he said to me you shall keep close to my young men until I have finished all my harvest and Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law it is good my daughter that you go out with his young women lest in another field you be assaulted there you see again verse 23 so she kept close to the young women of Boaz gleaning until the end of the barley and wheat harvest and she lived you expect the scene to end probably honestly as you're reading through this maybe for the first time you expect it to end with what an imminent marriage with a wedding banquet with Ruth and her restored mother-in-law Naomi being crowned as princesses by the worthy man Boaz but it doesn't end like that verse 23 is the epitome of anticlimactic the ending here is she lived with her mother-in-law no offense but she lived with her mother-in-law right back to whatever little hole in the wall rental she was staying in along with her mother-in-law nothing more nothing nothing yet entire chapter builds this massive anticipation for a surprising romance which is all we want because if we're honest even the most cold-hearted among us secretly love a good love story this chapter I want you to see it shifts focus from from Ruth from Boaz and even not just any potential romance they have but even from their characters themselves it shifts back to Naomi the star of chapter 1 and to the wonder in her heart like the Virgin Mary after and like Ruth the Moabite moments before look at verse 20 Naomi said to her daughter-in-law may he be blessed by the Lord whose kindness has not forsaken the living and the dead I know this is confusing but that word kindness there it's hesed which I introduced you to last week and it's not clear in English but the kindness Naomi speaks of here whose kindness has not forsaken the living and the dead is almost certainly not referring to Boaz but to God she sees her daughter-in-law filled with food and she hears the name of the man who treated her daughter-in-law in this way the empty bitter woman filled with anger at God depressed and despondent Naomi finally erupts and breaks into praise and maybe just maybe finally realizes that God is not against her but is smiling at her as well when she heard the name something changed inside and she knew I wonder what I could show you today or tomorrow what missing piece I could provide a name maybe an answer a reason which would break through the doubt in your heart and convince you once and for all that God really was and is behind it all in your life and really was and has been and is doing something in your life and really was and is good through it all in your life what could I show you what could God or something or nature reveal that would finally convince you that chance maybe even bad chance in your life was just God and His kind providences books will almost certainly not be written about your life or about mine we're not key characters in the story of redemption or the story of the Bible we're just us then again Ruth was just a widow just a Moabite just a nobody really even more than that she was an enemy of God until she encountered grace life almost always feels random we can't ever see the operator of life we only see His designs and to us they seldom make sense do they it all feels so random and sometimes it feels worse than random sometimes it feels darker sometimes it feels like somebody's actually actively against us I can only assure that there is a good God behind it all even your life and I can only assure you that on the basis of Calvary where God did turn against His own Son in order that He might smile upon you who trust Him Calvary means the cross means if you trust in Christ it means it means God is always behind the scenes of your life always working everything for your good and with a smile on His face isn't that wonderful news God thank you for thank you for the witness of your word of your rule and not just impersonal forces gravity but personal rule kingship and not just out there not just the big events not just the important people of the world not just world wars and presidents but over our lives our seemingly random often seemingly meaningless lives thank you for how your word convinces us that you rule and care over all of them and you do it with kindness God persuade our hearts more of these things now we pray by your spirit in Jesus name we ask Amen
