I hope you've had a wonderful summer. It's not my favorite of the four seasons, but it has been a good summer. My kids have turned into pretty good swimmers and are more and more confident in the water. And I'm very thankful for that. We're in the middle of a seven-week series on grace and on the doctrines of grace. Last week, we looked at the grace which began before time in the explosive and mysterious teaching from the Bible called election, God's work before time. Really, if you're a Christian, the back story to how you became a Christian. So I showed you last week the story of election. We looked at how actually election is not some new idea introduced by Paul or anybody else. It's a story that runs throughout the entire Bible. It's a story of Abraham who was chosen out of all the people of Ur of the Chaldeans. It's the story of Israel who was chosen by God out of all the other pagan nations. And God's word repeatedly makes clear that it was not because of anything special or unique, any strength of Israel that drew God to Israel. And it's also the story of the church. So the story of election runs throughout the entire Bible. We looked also, I showed you the source of election. It's all of God. It all originates from God. It happened, the Bible teaches, before the foundation of the world. It happened, the Bible teaches, we looked at Romans 9, before you were born. It even happened, we see in Acts 13 and other places, God choosing you in Christ happened before you believe. So it's all of God. It really is in the Bible. You're all still alive this morning. You've come back for some more. And today, part two, to wrap up this little bit on electing grace, I want to show you why that's not only true and not only, I think, clearly throughout the entire Bible as I tried to show you last week, I want to show you this morning why that's good news and why that story, the story of God choosing you independently of anything he saw in you, can actually help you and can help us and can change us as a church. So let's pick up right where we left off last time. This morning I want to show you three more things, three more S's. The security of election, I want to show you the security of election, how God's choice secures you. Then we'll look at the society of election, the sort of people and culture that election is meant to create, and we see it creating in the Bible, the society of election. And finally, the song of election. So the security of election, the society of election, and the song of election. Let's begin with the security of election. This will be by far the longest of my three points. First, I want to show you how election secures you and safeguards you and how, if you're a Christian, the foundation of your assurance. Don't you want to be assured that you really are going to heaven? It's found primarily, firstly, in election. I read this last week, but Article 10 in our Statement of Faith, which was written in 1853, says this, election is the foundation of Christian assurance, and confirming our election therefore deserves the utmost diligence. Election is the foundation of our Christian assurance. God choosing us before time is the foundation of our Christian assurance. How? Why? That's what I want to show you now, if you'll turn with me to Romans chapter 8. We'll look a little more carefully at the second passage that Austin just read for us. Romans 8 is one of the greatest chapters in all the Bible. Amen. It really is. It's unbelievable start to finish. Someday we'll get there. But we'll just look at a taste of it today. It contains, in all of its glories, it contains the so-called golden chain of salvation. Maybe you've heard of this before. Christians for centuries, actually, have called these few verses that we're going to look at the golden chain or the golden thread of salvation. That's what we want to look at now. Let me read for us one more time. Look at Romans chapter 8, and let me read for you verses 28 to 30 one more time. And we know, Paul says, that for those who love God, all things work together for good. For those who are called according to his purpose. For those whom God foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his son in order that he might be the firstborn, Jesus might be the firstborn among many brothers. And those whom he predestined, he also called. And those whom he called, he also justified. And those whom he justified, he also glorified. Do any of you know what a Rube Goldberg machine is? Actually you all do. Rube Goldberg machines are those, well, they can be small or massive, complex machines that people put together. They're typically homemade in somebody's room or in their yard. Think of an elaborate, complicated set of dominoes, only instead of dominoes, like, you know, it starts by me knocking over this microphone, which causes a ball to start rolling, and that goes into a little funnel, and then a drip of water comes out, and then all this long, elaborate thing to get a ping pong and a cup at the bottom of the stairs or outside. You know what a Rube Goldberg machine is? Yes, you've seen these. These are the things that bored teenagers spend hours and hours and days and days working on and then posting on YouTube, and then when it actually works, they go nuts like they've just cured cancer because it probably failed 50 times before, and because the more elaborate they are, one tiny little thing is just a centimeter off in the middle of this elaborate machine, and the whole thing, it doesn't work. The ping pong's not going in the cup. Paul is showing us a chain reaction here which has never been broken, never failed, and which never could fail because God built and God operates this machine, this chain, this thread of salvation. Here's the golden chain. It shows God foreknew, God then predestined, God then called, God then justified, and God will someday glorify. That's the golden chain of salvation, and it has never been broken. It's unbreakable, this machine of salvation, foreknew, predestined, called, justified, glorified. Let me show you. Let's work through this golden chain. I'm going to go through it backwards and then forwards so we can all see together and glory together in what Paul's saying. If you're a Christian, actually, if you're a Christian now or if you're a Christian tomorrow, if you someday trust in Christ yourself and become a believer, a follower, a Christian, this is the story. If you're a Christian now or tomorrow, this is the story of your past, of your present, and of your future. Let's start with working through it backwards. In other words, I'll begin with the end and those God glorified. Those God glorified. That refers to heaven and to the resurrection where God will remove your sin nature forever and crown you with holiness, which we're excited for that day, and give you a heavenly body like Jesus' resurrected body, and give you as an inheritance the new heavens and the new earths. Those are those who God glorified. And who are those that God glorified? Let's work backwards. They are those who God justified. That means to be forgiven of sins and declared righteous. So it has a negative aspect, a positive aspect. Positively washed of your sins, removed of your sins, positively declared righteous, robed in the righteous robes of Jesus Christ himself, which he gives to you by faith. It means God the judge looked upon a sinful people, and because of Jesus, he declared them to be righteous, though they weren't. He declared them to be sinless only by their believing in Jesus, which attached them to Jesus. God has counted their belief, faith, faith alone as righteousness, justified. And who are those whom God justified? Let's go back one more in this chain. They are those who God called. That refers, listen carefully, not only to when you heard the gospel, though it certainly includes that, and even on that matter, not everybody has heard. There are people and peoples and tribes and languages that have still to this day never heard the gospel. But you have, and when you heard the gospel, if you're a Christian, God the Holy Spirit actually spoke through the gospel to your heart, drawing you to this message and drawing you to this God. So when you heard the message of the gospel, be it through a pastor, a preacher, a parent, a friend, a sibling, a coach, an author, whoever, you believed. And why did you believe? Not because you're smarter than other people or you just have better sense than other people to choose the right things while they all choose the wrong things. You believed when you heard that message because you heard, in that voice speaking the gospel, you heard the voice of God calling out to you. This is what Paul's talking about here when he says those who God called. And let me ask you, have you heard that voice? Have you heard the voice of God through the preaching of the gospel? Through the preaching of Almighty God who made everything that is, the heavens and the earth. I just got back from Colorado where we stood before insane mountain cliffs. It was like, I don't know, 15 cliffs or something. They were all 14,000 feet or above in elevation. The God who put those mountains however long ago in the earth, that God from the heavens came down to earth. And the God of all holiness and of all glory and of all creative power took on frail human flesh and became a man called Jesus. And that man called Jesus lived a perfect life, the life that none of us ever lived. But in spite of that, though, he was the one man, the one human being, period, who actually deserved life and righteousness and no punishment, no harm. That man got in your place on a cross as a substitute for our sins. And he died. And he died beneath the weight, not more than the weight, the affliction of God his father's holy wrath stored up for the ages against our sins and justice. And he took those sins and he buried them into the grave and then he rose again from the dead victorious over your sins and my sins if you trust in him. That's the gospel. If you've heard that message or even if you're hearing it now for the first time and you're drawn to it and you're drawn to God and you're drawn to Jesus and you find yourself wanting Jesus more than your sin, what's happening there is you're hearing the call of God. You're hearing the voice of God speak through my voice, my imperfect words, Redneck from North Carolina, or whoever's words and voice you heard it through. Have you heard the call of God? Those whom God glorified or those whom God justified are those whom God called back once more are those whom God predestined. That refers to what we already saw last week in election, in eternity before creation and before time God claimed a people for himself. He wrote their names in the book of life. He decreed by his sovereign power that they would someday be his redeemed people. God predestined the people and who are those whom God predestined, let's move back to the final link, they are those whom God foreknew. Who God foreknew. This refers as it does elsewhere in the Bible to those whom God loved in advance. He knew them in the sense of how God knew Israel like he knew Abraham like he knew Jacob. He loved them and he took them for his friends. This is the language of intimate love like husband and wife in the Bible. Some people have translated this word foreknew as foreloved. God knew them. He knew their names and he loved them before they ever heard of him, before they even existed as we saw last week. What will happen to the church in heaven? What will happen to you if you're a Christian in heaven? being glorified is the final result, the final sequence of a chain of a work of God that began before time. Now reverse it just more quickly and let's go forward just to make the point. Let's start from the beginning as Paul does. Those who God foreknew. So God loved the people who were not yet even born. When did that happen? That happened in the Bible. It's clear. Before time. And so listen to how the apostle Peter begins his second letter, Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ to the elect exiles of the dispersion according to the foreknowledge of God. Salvation begins before time with foreknowledge, which is forelove. Let's keep moving forward. Those people whom God foreknew, he predestined. So those people who God knew and loved before time, he predestined, that is he determined their destiny. He determined that they should be his people, that they one day would be adopted as sons and daughters. When did that happen? Happened before time, before you were even born, Ephesians 1.5. In love, he predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ, as daughters through Jesus Christ our Lord. And those people who he predestined, he called. The people who God knew and loved before time and then predestined before time, he then called out to those people by his Holy Spirit, by the power of his word. They heard the gospel and they heard through the gospel God's powerful voice, the same voice that created the heavens and the earth, the trees, the mountains, and it called forth faith in them. He's still calling in this way to this day. He may be calling to your heart this morning. When does this happen? When does the call of God happen that Paul's speaking of here? This happens in time. Whenever you hear the gospel and believe, listen to Jesus, no one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him and I will raise him and her up on the last day. Who comes to Jesus? Only one person. Lots of people, but they're all the same in this way. Only people who God is calling out to and drawing in by the power of his Holy Spirit. And those people he justified. So the people who God knew and loved before time and then predestined before time and then called to himself in time, those people God justified. That is, he washed them of their sins and declared them to be righteous. They were forgiven. What we like to say is they got saved. When did that happen? That happened in time. Forever. Forever. True, but it happened in time and it's anchored even before time. Therefore, Paul says, Romans 5.1, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through Jesus Christ our Lord. And those people finally he glorified. The people who God knew and loved before time and then predestined before time and then called to himself in time and then justified in time, all those people and every single one he will someday glorify. That is, he will raise them up from the dead like he raised Jesus from the dead. He will take away their sin and their pain and their tears forever. And when will that happen? That will happen in the last day. We're not there yet. So Jesus says, John 17.21, the glory that you have given me, I have given to them. So Jesus says in John 6.40, and this is the will of my father, that everyone who looks on the son and believes in him should have eternal life and I will raise him up on the last day. Now, friends, that day is not here yet. But Paul is saying, and I hope you can see, that that day where if you're a Christian, you will be glorified, where you will be brought to God as a forgiven friend. Are you scared of that day, by the way? I know many of us are. It's very normal to be scared of that. Are you unsure of that day? That's why we're afraid of that day, because we're unsure of what will happen. Listen, Paul is saying, that day is as sure as the day you believed. No, wait a second. He's saying even more than that. It's even surer than that. He's saying it's as sure as the day that God loved you and chose you before the foundation of the world. So certain is this future day, this future reality for the people of God, where God will raise them up and glorify them, that Paul writes about that future in the past tense. Did you notice that? Those whom he justified, he glorified. That sounds like something he did in the past, but he hasn't done it yet. Why is Paul speaking that way? This is what's called the historical future. It's so certain, sometimes biblical authors talk in this way, it's so certain that he talks about it in the past tense. It's as good as done in God's book. So I don't know what you think about this. I imagine there are lots of thoughts and confusions and questions about this, but here's the deal. One of my jobs as a pastor is to, number one, convince you that salvation really is all and entirely of God. And number two, to persuade you further that that's actually really, really, really good news. Maybe the best news in all the world. Because here's the deal. There's something in us, in all of us, that wants to hold on to at least a piece of our salvation. Do you know this in your own heart? So yeah, God walked the 99 feet, the cross, his death, his resurrection. But that last foot, I got to take that last step. God built the entire machine, but he left it, I've got to turn the on button. Only I can flip the switch. Do you know that in your own heart? At least in all of our hearts. We cling to this last bit of the work like all our dignity depends on it. It's maybe the last column to crumble of our pride, the very pride which first caused us to fall from the heights of image bearers in the first place. My kids have turned into pretty good swimmers. I'm more and more confident in the water. And we recently went to the beach with our family, and there was a massive sandbar 100 yards out or so. So it looked pretty far out there, but there were just tons of kids and adults standing out there in the water in the sandbar 100 yards out or more. It was like not even up to their knees. And so my kids are looking at the sandbar, Dad, I want to go out there. Let's go out there. And so the older ones who are more confident and competent swimmers were like, I want to do this. Are you sure you want to do this? Yeah, I want to do this. We'll swim out there together. I got this, Dad. Sweet. What a challenge we have here. How fun a challenge we're going to conquer together. And so out we went. As soon as we got a few yards out, the water got deep, and it was actually really rough. The current was really strong, and it was really tough swimming. I'm not that strong of a swimmer, but it was still really tough swimming. Somebody actually had to be called in, and a lifeguard had to come out there. So my kids, we are a few yards out. My kids, let's do this, Dad. I got this. No, no, no. I got this. My kids come over to me and swim with me, and I hold them, and I'm not a very good swimmer, and so holding them makes me an even worse swimmer. And I did my best, and sure enough, I carried them out there. They came over to me, and they said, just a few yards out. I got it. I got it. And no, Dad, swim me. There's something in us that in time, right now, today, wants to fight and kick and scream to hold on to our place, what we think is our place in this salvation, and our dignity, we think, our rights. But I can assure you all that when you come to the judgment, and when you answer to God Almighty in His blazing holiness, there will be no single part of you that wants to hold on to any so-called rights or insist on any part of yours in this play. Just imagine coming before the judgment of God, Jesus at your right hand. What are you going to do, Jesus? Can you please speak? Just hold on to you, and He will. And that's wonderful news. If just one inch of this whole machine of salvation, if just one inch really does depend upon me, that last wretched inch will be the eternal death of me. But it's not, and it won't be, because that's not how this works. God does it all. This is what Paul's saying. God does it all from start to finish. God carries the burden. God built the entire machine. God operates the entire machine. Jesus carries us through the current, through the grave, through the judgment, ours the cross, the grave, the skies, amen? That's why Paul concludes this golden chain in Romans 8 with a series of questions. Look at where Romans 8 concludes. Verse 31, what shall we say to these things? If God is for us, then who can be against us? Verse 32, if He spared not His only Son, but gave Him up for us all, how will He not give us all things? Verse 33, who shall bring any charge against God's elect? Verse 34, who is to condemn? Verse 35, who shall separate us from the love of Christ? You know what the answer to all those questions is? Nothing, and nobody. Jesus has done it all. Nobody can speak against or stop what He's done, not even the devil. No, verse 37 says, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us. We all want security. None of us wants fragility or fear or worry or anxiety. We look to money for security. We look to our parents for security. We look to boyfriends or girlfriends or spouses for security or friends or to good grades. You can look to God and His salvation in Christ. It has been secured from all eternity. It is as sure as God Himself. Let me read as I wrap up this first point from Richard Sibbes, the great English Puritan. This whole chain, he's talking about Romans 8, this whole chain so holds that all the creatures in heaven and earth cannot break a single link of it. Whom God calls, He will justify and glorify. Therefore, never doubt your endurance, for it holds firm on God's part, not yours. That's great news. Election is preached by Paul and others for your assurance and for your security and mine because it's pointing you to how this entire thing, you, your soul, rests in God's work which predates time. Secondly, let me show you the society of election, the society of election. I want to talk for a minute about how this teaching is supposed to shape us together as a church and shape how we relate to each other as a church family. In other words, I want to talk about the society that it's supposed to create. We've been talking and exploring election for two weeks now. That's not how I originally set out, but it was, you can clearly see I've got two sermons here. I've really probably got five sermons here, but let me ask you a question about election. When you think about, when you think about the people who talk the most about election, what word, don't answer out loud, what word do you most associate them with? I don't know if you've ever been around anybody who talks a lot about election. What word comes to mind when you think about those people? Sadly, I would guess a word that comes to many of your minds, maybe just came to many minds, is arrogance. Why is it that the people most passionate about this teaching from the Bible often come off as the most arrogant and know it all? How darkly ironic, if you think about it, that we could take a teaching that plainly says, God chose you and it had nothing to do with you. He didn't see anything special in you and turn that into a beating stick upon which we club our friends who disagree and a bragging right because we know more than others. How foolish our pride is. Well, the Bible talks about election a lot as well, but it doesn't share our perspective or our tone insofar as that's our perspective and our tone, one of arrogance. If we were to ask that same question of the Bible and of the guys who wrote the Bible, something like this, when you think of the Bible authors and all their talk of election, what word would you most associate them with as they talk about election? I would suggest that the best word most accurately capturing their teaching and even the tone of their teaching would be love. Colossians 3, verse 12. Listen to how Paul speaks of election. Put on then as God's chosen ones. Holy and beloved. Put on then as God's chosen ones, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, bearing with one another. And if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other as the Lord has forgiven you. So you also must forgive. Do you see how Paul foregrounds a community of love and humility and forgiveness in their being chosen ones in their election? He reasons from election to humility and love and forgiving each other. What are we missing? 1 John 4, verses 10 and 11. And this is love. Not that we have loved God, but that he loved us. That's everything I tried to show you last week. And you know from last week that the love he had for us began before time. And this is love. Not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his son to be a wrath bearer for our sins. Beloved, if God has so loved us, we also ought to love one another. What's John saying? God loved us and he loved us first. And his love had nothing to do with us or with anything he saw in us. No potential, no spark of potential, or anything he thought he could use. That's how God loved. In other words, unconditionally. John takes that and then turns around to the church and says, Beloved, just as he's loved you, so you also ought to love one another. What does he mean? He doesn't mean you ought to love others before time. You and I don't exist before or outside of time. Obviously, that's not possible. What he means is we, like God, ought to love each other without conditions. If you can, listen to me, if you can only love people who meet all your conditions, so they have to think like you, look like you, agree with you, act only in ways that make you feel comfortable, never offend you. Friends, anybody and everybody loves like that. Hitler loved like that. But that's not how God loved, is it? Let me read for you a random verse that I bet you've never heard, I bet there's a good chance you've never heard it referenced in any sermon or any church service ever. Romans 16, 13. Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord. Also his mother, who has been a mother to me as well. This is Paul in the conclusion, the final salutudes of the letter he wrote to Romans. And in the middle of all his goodbye to this person, goodbye to that person, he says, greet Rufus. Anybody know anybody named Rufus? Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord. Belonging to a church, we just recognized a handful who are the newest members of this church. Belonging to a church means scheduling weekly hangouts, namely every Sunday morning with several weirdos. And really cool people. And some really interesting people. And some really hard people. Think about our church, if you've been a part of our church family for a while or if you're just visiting, think about whatever. If you're coming from a church, think about the church family that you're coming from. There are probably people here who are really easy for you. Maybe your family's here, your sibling. Or people who you just share lots of things in common with. So you would be friends with them if Jesus never once came up. You enjoy the same things as them. You share lots of opinions with them. But think about your church. There are also other people, aren't there? Who, well, things aren't so easy. You don't relate to them so easily. You share nothing in common. You disagree with them politically. You parent differently from them. Frankly, they annoy you. They talk too much. They talk about the same thing every time you see them. The same conspiracy theory around and around and around or whatever the latest one. Who is, let me ask you a question. Who is the hardest person in this church for you to love? Don't you dare answer out loud, look at anybody else or touch anybody. Who is the hardest person in the church for you to love? I'm going to give them a name for you and for our collective imagination. We're going to call this person Rufus. Who is your Rufus? Friends, let me tell you about Rufus. Your Rufus, my Rufus, all our Rufuses. Rufus was chosen by God before time for love and for love alone. God loves Rufus exactly as he loves you and me. God doesn't roll his eyes at Rufus or become more exhausted or annoyed by him any more than he does by you or by me. And I don't think he's frankly annoyed or eye-rolling at you or me because I don't think that's how grace works. God loves Rufus as he loves me and for the same reason he loves me and one reason that is grace. Nothing in me, nothing in Rufus, just grace. Do you see how this teaching, which we ironically pick up and use as a sword or pick up to puff up, do you see how this teaching of election connects to love? Paul, having discovered election, then started to change his worldview so that he now sees people and saw people as people who were chosen and loved by God before time. That my friends is how you and I should view our fellow believers in Christ as chosen in the Lord, loved before time, loved by the God of the universe. That means in the church the most difficult and isolated people in the entire church family are not the people we should avoid. Those are the very people we should most move towards and care for and treat them like they're actually loved by God before time. Why? Because that's how God treated us. This is the society that election creates. And just briefly, I want to mention the song of election. I want to conclude briefly by pointing out something very simple but very profound. Virtually every time in the Bible that an author gives particular attention to this teaching that I've covered last week and this week, namely election, predestination. Virtually every single time Paul or whoever gives this teaching and begins writing about this teaching, they end in song. And so Ephesians 1, God chose us before the foundation of the world. In love he predestined us to be adopted as sons and daughters. That teaching of election by Paul ends with a chorus in Ephesians 1, 3 through 14, repeated again and again and again to the praise of his glorious grace. To the praise of his glorious grace. Romans 9, Paul and really the whole Bible's probably most controversial teaching, most difficult, most hard to grasp teaching on election. Jacob and Esau in the womb before they were born, God chose Jacob not Esau. Jacob I loved. Esau I hated. It ends, Paul's pen keeps writing until it gets to Romans 11, oh the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God. How inscrutable are his judgments, how unsearchable his ways, for from him and through him and to him are all things and so to him be glory forever and ever, amen. Somebody brings this up to us and we either roll our eyes about it or we want to go to war with whoever just brought it up, whichever side they're on and whichever side we're on. Whenever Paul brings it up, he cannot help but to burst into song, why? Because this teaching, as much as any teaching in all the Bible, gives us a glimpse of just how great God is and just how great salvation is and just how deep it runs and just how secure it is. Spurgeon, quote, at the very announcement of a passage I'm going to preach on election, at the very announcement of the text, some will be ready to say, why would you preach, Spurgeon, on so profound a doctrine as election? I answer, because it is in God's word and whatever is in God's word must be preached. He goes on, whatever may be said about the doctrine of election, it is in the written word of God and it was written as with an iron pin and there's no getting rid of it. To me, it is one of the sweetest and most blessed truths in the whole of Revelation and those who are afraid of it are afraid of it because they do not understand it. If they could but know that the Lord had chosen them, it would make their hearts to dance for joy. Friends, it's that last line that I want more than anything else for you and for us on this teaching. I don't care about anybody parroting what I've said or agreeing with me on every single first, second, third point. I know you have questions. I have questions. But if they could but know that the Lord had chosen them, it would make their hearts to dance for joy. The big idea of election is that God has loved you and loved you for far longer than you had any idea. After all, he loved you before you were born. Behold and wonder before the great God who wrote down names in a book written before the dawn of time which guaranteed their salvation. God has loved you forever, Christian. If you'll come to Christ right now, the same will be true of you. God will have loved you. We can say with confidence upon your repentance and faith, God has loved you forever. And isn't that worth singing about with Paul? Let me pray so that we can respond in our own song now. Let's pray together. And we especially trust you when there are things that are beyond us, mysterious, things we don't understand, things that brush up against assumptions we have or even the limitations of our minds and our hearts. But God, you wrote this word to us, it's clear, to care for us and to convince us, to persuade us of your love for us. God, I pray by your Holy Spirit that all who are here and are yours would be persuaded by your love for them even now. And God, for everyone else, we all pray together, your people pray together that you would call out to them by your powerful voice which created the heavens and the earth and draw them to yourself in Jesus' name. And we pray all these things in Jesus' name, amen.
